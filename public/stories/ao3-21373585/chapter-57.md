**A/N: Sorry for the wait on this one. I really wanted to get this right. I was struggling at first, because this is something I'm sure many of you have already seen before in TY (minus the whole OFA thing). Not to mention we had the chapters of looking back through All Might's memories, and a decent chunk of this is looking back at canon events you already know about.**

**I wanted to make this interesting in its own right, and I think I had a good idea here.**

**Also, to unintentionally make up for the wait time, this chapter is pretty damn long.**

***~...AMP…~***

  
  

“Okay, how does this work?”

The couple had finished in the shower, now fully under the covers. Admittedly, what Izuku really wanted was sleep. This was the most mentally exhausted he had been in a long time. But, he wasn’t gonna make Kyouka wait any longer; this was long overdue.

They laid together, face-to-face, the lights off, their joined hands between them. 

“You just close your eyes, and think about the vestige space. It seems like as long as you intend to go there, it’ll let you in.” Izuku replied, exhaustion still evident in his voice. “I’m not totally sure it’ll work, but I think it should. I don’t see any reason why we both can’t be there at the same time. You said you saw me there once, right?”

“Kinda,” Kyouka shrugged. “You were in your coma. It’s the only time I’ve ever been, and I think Nana was the one that pulled me there.”

“Still worth a shot. You ready?” 

“To sleep? After all this, I’ll sleep for a year.”

“Mm, unfortunately it doesn’t feel like sleep. You won’t be tired when you wake up, but you’ll somehow still feel like you’ve been awake for days.”

Kyouka sighed as she buried her face into her pillow, “Does anything with this stupid quirk not come with an asterisk?”

“You already know the answer to that,” Izuku hummed as he laid his head down, closing his eyes. “Just relax, think about that space, and you’ll find yourself there…”

After the day they had, with both the exams and the fight with Bakugou, it didn’t take long for their exhaustion to begin to completely overtake them. Kyouka gently rubbed Izuku’s forearm, her words coming out slowly and mumbled as consciousness began to leave her, *“Are you scared?”*

*“Mm, of what?”*

*“Of going back, seeing all these things…”*

*“...I think I’m more ashamed, I guess. All these things I should’ve done differently.”*

Kyouka pursed her lips, pulling Izuku’s head in to rest against her chest. They were quiet from that point on, letting sleep finally take them.

However, they were in for a long night.

  
  
  

***~...AMP…~***

  
  

**(** **One For All** **)**

  
  

Kyouka’s eyes shot open, yet she could see nothing. 

Eventually the complete darkness turned into rolling black clouds making up the entirety of the void she found herself in. She looked down, seeing her body fully formed. At least she wasn’t stuck like her first time here.

“Hm, it worked.” Kyouka turned around, finding Izuku standing next to her. “At the very least, now we know where to go if we want to ensure absolute privacy.”

“Privacy outside of the other eight occupants…Something I haven’t really thought about until now. Uh, how aware are all these people when we’re not here? Like, do they watch, or…?”

“I think only if they want to, but it’s still best not to think about it.” Izuku turned back to her, finding Kyouka looking all around, as if trying to find something in the ink-black, endless space. “You okay?”

“Yeah, yeah, just…I still can’t believe how complicated this quirk is. I don’t understand how any of this is possible. Am I in your mind? Are you in my mind? Are we in each other’s minds? Are we in a space between our minds?”

“I’ve been over it a millions times in my head, I truly don’t know. I guess it’s whatever allowed the stockpiled energy to travel back and forth between two people. We share the same quirk factor, so it might almost be like a mental link. Hm, we pull from the same power, but we have separate bodies and quirk factors. Maybe we have some sort of mental barrier that blocks us from fully usi-”

“Izuku.”

“Hm? Oh, right. Sorry.”

“Hey, I’m the one who asked.”

“No, really. It’s better I don’t distract myself from this. I guess we start at the beginning. Might as well show you everything.”

The black clouds began to vibrate and swirl, shifting all around and taking form, their colors beginning to change. Counters and cabinets were built, off-white walls found in your typical hospitals, charts of anatomy and pin boards with X-rays appeared all at once. 

The doctor’s office fully formed, with the doctor appearing on the rolling stool in the center. Kyouka still remembered that prick’s face, from the book on quirk research and history that Momo had given Izuku for his birthday.

She still wasn’t convinced that those two were the same guy, saying the book was from so long ago. But, at the time, Izuku seemed so certain they were the same person.

Now that she was face-to-face with him, Kyouka had to admit, Izuku was right. They looked the exact same. Anyone would think that they were the same person. Across from him, a younger Inko and Izuku appeared. He was still so damn cute. She still had that picture of little Izuku that Inko had given her.

Her adoration of seeing Izuku as such a giddy little kid was instantly struck down when she realized what this memory was. 

“There’s no hope for him.”

She turned around and looked at the doctor in pure disgust. He wasn’t even talking about her, yet Kyouka still felt like she was slapped across the face. What kind of phrasing was that? Who was this piece-of-shit?

The doctor started to explain everything, going over Izuku’s charts and X-rays, but she completely blocked him out. She couldn’t focus on anything but the look on little Izuku’s face. He was just sitting there smiling, unblinking, unmoving. 

Not that much different from the expression the real Izuku was making, minus the smile.

He was staring at his X-rays, the image having been burned into his brain for all these years. “My pinkie toe. The trajectory of my life was dictated by my damn pinkie toe.”

“That’s not exactly true.”

“Yes, and no. You know me. You know how stubborn I am, how delusional I made myself. Maybe it was because I heard it so young that I focused so heavily on it. When you’re a kid, you think you can be anything. Every door is ready to be walked through, reality won’t set-in for years to come. When reality smacks you in the face too young, you don’t know what to do with it. You’re not ready for it, you’re not supposed to be. You don’t know how to handle it. I was four-years-old, and I was already…lost, I guess. Everything I wanted from life was gone. And, yes. I know. I’m fully aware that I was four. I can’t really have a direction in life, I don’t even have a life at that point. It doesn’t stop the feeling.”

“I know. Saying that everything about my own mind’s poison started when I was the same age, I completely get it.”

Izuku turned back to his younger self, his eyes landing on the All Might action figure, stuck in the boy’s death grip. The world began to shift again, the doctor’s office fading away into a bedroom. Kyouka instantly recognized it as Izuku’s room. It wasn’t difficult, saying that outside of a few posters, figures, and his journals, his room was basically the same as it was now. 

The lights were off, and it was clearly night time. The only light came from the computer on the corner desk.

***~”I AM HERE!!!”~***

Oh, right. This would be the next memory. She remembered Izuku telling her about this; both the video and what was to come.

She walked around the office chair, seeing young Izuku watch the video, the exact same expression from the doctor’s office, except this time he had never-ending tears flowing from his eyes. She had looked-up the video a while back, not too long after Izuku told her about it the first time. 

The door creaked open, revealing Inko on the other side. She opened her mouth, clearly desperate to say something, anything. But, nothing came out. 

“Mom…?” Izuku slowly turned towards his mother, a shaky little hand raising up to point at the screen. “Do you think…Do you think I can still be a hero? Like him?”

Inko’s lips started quivering, her face clenching as she so desperately tried not to cry, but it was fruitless. She rushed to her son’s side, falling to her knees as her arms wrapped tightly around him. She sobbed into his shoulder, rocking them back and forth, “I’m sorry, Izuku…I’m so sorry…”

Kyouka shut her eyes, turning away from the memory. Izuku reached over, taking her hand in his, “Sorry if this is hard to watch. I know I’ve told you about this moment, but I guess I thought seeing everything would give you an even better understanding.”

Kyouka scoffed as she turned back to him, “Me? You’re worried about this being hard *for me?”*

“I’ve lived through it and thought about it constantly for years. Practically numb by this point.” Izuku looked back at the memory, sighing as it faded away into One For All’s void. “...More or less. It was thanks to you that I was able to move past this moment at all. And, Nana as well. But, I moved past the parts about my mom, feeling guilty for the way I was born…I guess I never dealt with my own feelings of thinking I was a mistake.”

With a wave of his hand, the scene changed once more. Izuku doubted the environment was one-hundred-percent accurate. He was so young when this happened, some things were bound to be fuzzy.

But, the words spoken were burned into every wrinkle of his brain.

Kyouka found herself in a colorful little classroom, basic hiragana and katakana on the walls, small children popping up from the black clouds, sitting on the floor. But, of course, that also included the last person she wanted to see. 

Izuku heard Kyouka groan, following her gaze towards the instantly recognizable, spikey, blonde hair. “We can’t avoid him, Kyouka. Unfortunately, he’s a very pivotal person in my life…Just not in the good way.”

Little Katsuki apparently heard him, and really wanted to prove his point. He raised up Izuku’s nameplate, assumedly from his desk, pointing at the characters. “Yo, check it out. You can read the kanji of Midoriya’s name like ‘Deku’. Useless, huh? Seems pretty fitting to me!”

He cackled, the rest of the children following suit, many of them parroting Katsuki by chanting “Deku”. Kyouka looked over at the young Izuku, and she already wasn’t sure if she could take her heart breaking so many times in such quick succession.

He was looking around, his face almost like he was confused. His eyes wide glistened, innocent and overwhelmed, his lips just barely open as he wasn’t sure what to say. He looked…

Lost.

In one fell swoop, he was all alone…

If his diagnosis was the spark, Bakugou doused him in kerosene, even if he didn’t realize what he had done. It seemed like Izuku didn’t even fully comprehend that he was ostracized, too young to truly understand what was happening. All he could tell was that he didn’t like it. 

Kyouka wanted to just pick him up, and take him away from it all. 

She stepped forward, leaning down in front of him. Izuku raised a brow, “Kyouka, it’s a memory. You can’t-”

But, much to his surprise, Kyouka picked the little Izuku right up into her arms. She hugged him close, and without a word he gripped onto her shirt. Izuku watched in awe, not sure what to even say. 

“We’re creating all this. I figured we can affect it how we want.” Kyouka pressed her cheek against Izuku’s hair, rubbing his back, “Don’t you worry about them. You find real friends in the future. People who love you. Me, especially.”

Well, this was certainly a sight Izuku never thought he would ever see, mostly because by every normal standard it was impossible. But, this quirk seemed to keep working miracles alongside its disasters. 

Seeing Kyouka hug his younger self was…

He didn’t know what it was. It wasn’t him, just a conjured up memory of him. But, it was still oddly comforting. He wasn’t sure if it was Kyouka that was making his younger-self hold onto her like, or it was just something in his subconscious that did it.

It was what he did, after all. He held onto her tight, depending on her at every turn. 

“You’re good with kids, you know?”

Kyouka turned back to him, eyes wide, her hand covering little Izuku’s ears as she whispered, *“I am absolutely not having this conversation, we’re at bare minimum a decade away from that topic.”*

“Wh-? No, I just meant-”

Kyouka cut him off, chuckling, “I know, I know. Just figured we needed something to lighten the mood. Here…” At the back of the classroom, the fog of One For All created another child. A young Kyouka appeared, focusing on strumming a tiny guitar. Kyouka set Izuku down, nudging him towards her, “Go play.”

He ran his way over to Kyouka, sitting down next to her and watching her play her guitar. 

The real Izuku walked over and stood next to Kyouka, watching the scene play out before them. Izuku couldn’t help but smile, even if just a little solemnly, “If only…”

“Mhm. In another life, I guess. But, we still found each other eventually, even if later than we wished.”

As Izuku watched their younger selves, he finally understood what he was feeling. It was a relief. Was what he was watching real? No, of course not. But, now, when he thinks back on this memory, he’ll remember this image.

He’ll remember that Kyouka was the one who changed name Deku for him. She wasn’t a bandage trying to cover all of his wounds. Kyouka spent countless hours— even if unknowingly for a lot of it— stitching him back together, making him better than he ever was before. 

Because of her, he could look back at this once considered life-ruining moment, and think of it as just a mere dark spot that would lead to something much greater.

For him, at least. For some people, however…

Kyouka turned back around, scowling down at the younger Katsuki with disgust, “He really was just always like this, huh?”

Izuku sighed with a shrug, “He was always kind of bratty. He was raised by a headstrong parent, so it was almost expected at his age. But, once he got his quirk…It just magnified everything.”

“That’s a very nice way of saying he became a piece-of-shit at the age of four.”

“...Pretty much.”

“And, let me guess. You inject him with teenage angst and hormones and he becomes ten-times worse than this?”

Izuku frowned, the memory shifting around them once more. “Unfortunately, he didn’t even need the hormones to do that.”

  
  
  

***~...AMP…~***

  
  
  

Once again, everything around them changed. Trees formed from the ground, a large gap formed in front of them, greens and blues all swirling into existence. Shallow water flowed through the creek, a fallen resting above from one end to the other, acting as a bridge.

More kids popped up in a row, moving towards the fallen tree. The features finally formed, showing Bakugou at the front, and behind him were the two lackeys who Kyouka remembered from months; the kid with wings and the kid with extending fingers. Rokuro Kubi and Naides Yubi, respectively. 

Last in line was Izuku, not looking quite as enthusiastic to be there as the others. 

Katsuki hopped up onto the tree, pointing forward and confidently leading the charge with the rest of the kids clamboring up after him. 

Kyouka furrowed her brow as she watched them go, “You know what I just don’t get? Why is he so popular? As kids? Sure, I guess I get it. Kids have such a lack of awareness and understanding that someone like Bakugou must seem really cool. But, now? Here at UA? I’m so confused, especially for Kirishima. Based on everything we know about him, Kirishima should be in the same boat as us. Sure, people find him annoying, but he still has his followers.”

“Most people don’t have the same context as us,” Izuku shrugged.

“Yeah, but he still treats everyone like shit. Why does no one question why he always shouts how he’s gonna kill people? Why does nobody seem to wonder why he wants to be a hero when he doesn’t give a single shit about anyone? All this job is for him is an outlet for his violent behavior that he can do legally and get paid for.”

“It’s…complicated,” Izuku sighed, looking down at the young version of his tormentor. “We both always idolized All Might, so on some level he understands the need the save innocents. But, he did always seem to latch onto the ‘beating bad guys’ part of being a hero. I guess innocent lives aren’t lost when the villain is so beaten and broken that he can’t harm them.”

“And his other violent tendencies?"

Izuku pursed his lips, “Yeah, uh…Yeah, that’s all him.”

Back on the fallen tree, Katsuki was almost halfway across when his foot slipped on the curve of the tree. She fell down and into the creek below, the other two looking down at him. 

“Yo, Bakugou!” Rokuro shouted down at the water. “You good?”

Katsuki’s head emerged from the water, still on his hands and knees. He shook his head, looking back up at them with a confident smile, “You know me. All good. Be up in just a sec.”

Katsuki then heard water sloshing behind him, turning back to see Izuku, his hand reaching out towards him. “Are you okay? You didn’t hit your head or something?” 

Katsuki froze, his gaze locked on Izuku. The image of the young boy reaching his hand out to help him up already burning into his memory. Something just hit him like a truck, his stomach churning and anger bubbling up. 

He didn’t want help. He never needed help. *Ever.* He was strong, stronger than everyone else, and they all said so themselves. 

Heroes helped the weak, not the other way around. Someone like Izuku, quirkless…

That made him the weakest of them all.

He had the audacity to think he needed to help Katsuki, to look down at him like he was weak; someone stronger than him, better than him…

Katsuki sneered as he smacked his hand away, shoving Izuku’s chest as he scrambled back up. Izuku fell back into the water, looking up as his “friend” now loomed over him. “I don’t need your help! What help would you even be?! You're a useless, quirkless freak!”

Katsuki spun around, moving to climb up out of the water. “B-But I-”

Shut up,” Katuski glared back over his shoulder at him. “Stay away from me! Never should’ve let you keep following me once you were quirkless.”

They watched Katsuki and his lackeys leave him there, moving further into the forest, leaving Izuku all alone.

“Are you kidding me?” Kyouka’s eye twitched, sneering at the disappearing forms of Katsuki and his goons. “No, seriously, are you kidding me? He started to hate you even more, because you *tried to help him up?* He’s doomed. He has no hope, he’s stuck like this forever. If I didn’t know about Shoto’s dad, I’d call Bakugou the most pathetic person I’ve ever had the displeasure of knowing.”

“Kyouka, we know Shigaraki.”

“And he’s unironically been nicer to us than Bakugou has ever been.”

“I-...Huh. That uh…That’s true.”

“I just-...” Kyouka bit the inside of her cheek, looking down at Izuku still sitting in the creek. He wasn’t moving to get up, just staring into the water…

“Yo!” Little Izuku looked up at the ledge above, finding a younger Kyouka looking down at him, black Metallica shirt and red skirt on, violin case slung around her back, “You good?”

Izuku stood up out of the water, just giving a little shrug, “I guess…”

Her jack extended down the rocks, stopping just in front of Izuku, “Here, climb up.”

Izuku stared in awe at the little appendage in front of him, tentatively reaching out for it. It wrapped around his hand, lightly pulling him to help him climb. He made it up to the grass, allowing her jack to unwrap from around his hand. “Th-Thanks.”

“No problem. I heard your friend. He sounds like a real jerkwad.”

“He’s not a jerk. He’s just…Uh…” Izuku wasn’t really sure how else to put it. Kacchan was his friend, but… “...I guess…I-I guess he has been kind of a jerk.”

“Sounded like it. He called you quirkless or something? You don’t have one?”

Izuku looked down, his hands kneading together, “N-...N-No…”

“Oh. Don’t worry about it. You’re not missing out on much. You could’ve ended up with something weird like me…”

Izuku looked back up, shaking his head, “I-I don’t think they’re weird. I think your things are super cool!”

Kyouka pouted her lips, looking away from him as her jacks clinked together, “Don’t tease me. Everyone makes fun of me enough about ‘em…”

“N-No! Really! What do they actually do?”

Kyouka peered at this strange boy suspiciously. He seemed genuine enough, but you could never know. But, what did she have to lose anyway? “They give me super-hearing and junk.”

“That’s so cool…” Izuku stared in awe. 

Kyouka side-eyed him, a blush tinting her cheeks as her jacks clinked together. Eventually, they reached out and poked his nose, “Stop staring.”

“O-Oh! I’m sorry…”

Kyouka gripped the strap of her violin case, her jacks retracting, “What are you doing out here anyway? Isn’t this place restricted?”

“Kacchan wanted to come here,” Izuku shrugged. “What are you doing here then?”

“Shortcut to my parents’ studio. Wanna come? There are some heroes that are doing collabs with bands.”

“R-Really? That’d be amazing! But, are you sure?”

“Yeah, why not. I guess you’re kinda cool. C’mon.” 

Kyouka began their trek out of the forest, but Izuku did a double-take before going after her, “W-Wait? You think I’m cool?!”

They ran off, disappearing into the forest. Kyouka turned back to Izuku as the memory faded away, shrugging her shoulders at his perplexed expression, “I dunno. I can’t just stand here and let it all happen. And, yes, I know how stupid that is. None of this is real, but…”

Izuku cut her off by taking her hand and kissing her knuckles, “Thank you. You’re right, it’s not real, but that doesn’t stop it from making me feel better.”

Kyouka smiled, hugging his arm to her chest, pressing her face into his shoulder, “I should probably stop, though. With the things I’m probably gonna see, it…”

“Don’t stop on my account.” 

“I don’t know. It would feel wrong to inject myself into moments like that. This is about you, your story.”

“Yeah, well…My story isn’t exactly a happy one until you get there. I don’t mind a couple rewrites here and there.”

“Hey, you met All Might before you met me. Your story was happy before I came along.”

“I consider you the true turning-point.”

“Izuku, you wouldn’t have even met me without All Might and One For All.”

“That’s true. However, if I still got One For All, but we never got together, then that’s not a life I consider worth living…That’s a very poor choice of phrasing in this scenario, but I stand by what I said.”

  
  

***~...AMP…~***

  
  
  

As the world began to take shape around them, Kyouka almost instantly recognized the place. It was what was now legally known as “Deku Park”, one of her birthday gifts to Izuku. It looked pretty much the exact same as it did in the present day, with the equipment looking just a bit less used. 

“S-Stop! You’re making h-him cry!” The younger Izuku reappeared, standing in front of a child Kyouka didn’t recognize from any of the other memories. The boy behind him was on the ground, crying from the scratches and burns on his arm. 

And, of course, who else appeared before them?

“Not my fault he’s a crybaby,” Katsuki shrugged, wicked smile on his face as his two lackeys stood behind him. “Now, get outta the way, Deku.”

“I-I-...I-I won’t let you. I’ll stop you myself.”

Katsuki stopped, his brows raising up in incredulity as he and his lackeys all began to laugh, “Pfft! Hahahahaha! Are you freakin’ serious? Little Deku thinks he’s a hero now?”

Rokuro lowered himself down to Bakugou’s level, his wings flapping behind him, “What should we do about this twerp, Bakugou?”

“What do you think, idiot? Get him.”

Kyouka remembered finding this playground, Izuku showing her the scorch marks still leftover after all those years. It was painful to think about, to hear Izuku describe the memory. 

It was torture to see it. 

Yubi used his extended fingers to latch into Izuku’s head, keeping him in place as Katsuki grabbed a fistful of his shirt, explosions popping and smoke billowing out from between his fingers. 

With every punch landed, she flinched. With every explosion, she closed her eyes. With every cry of pain, her jacks tensed. 

Eventually, she just couldn’t take it.

“Alright,” Kyouka waved her hand, the memory evaporating instantly, returning the world around them back to the black void. “I can’t watch that anymore.”

“I get it,” Izuku nodded. “I feel like I shouldn’t be showing you this.”

Kyouka turned to him, brow furrowed, “What? Why?”

“You’re just gonna hate him even more.”

Kyouka blinked a couple times, deadpanning at him, “...Izuku, are you kidding me?”

“I know,” Izuku cut her off, putting his hand out in defense. He sighed, shaking his head, “There is good in him, I just…He’s not capable of showing it yet. I’m done trying to find it. I just…I can’t. I can’t do it anymore, not with all I have on the line, with everything I need to do. He’s gotta do it on his own, as far away from me as he can do it. After tonight, he and I shouldn’t even be in the same room anymore.”

“Ugh, you’re so damn pure. And, you’re about ten years late to that realization.”

“I said I can see he has good in him. Doesn’t mean I don’t hate him. It doesn’t mean I won’t do what I did again if he dares try and hurt you again. But, I do see him for what he is. He’s a product of circumstance, luck, how society is as a whole, everything. It doesn’t excuse him, and it doesn’t mean I forgive him. It doesn’t mean I’ll ever forgive him. But, everyone is capable of change, even him. At this point, it doesn’t matter if I never forgive him, or if we hate him for the rest of our lives. I just want to move forward as a better person than I was. I can confidently say I’ve been doing that, a lot of that is all thanks to you.”

Kyouka bit the inside of her cheek, looking down at her feet, “I hope you know I never meant to push you to go against that golden heart of yours. I know seeing the best in people is more your style, I jus-”

“I know,” Izuku nodded, holding Kyouka’s face. “My sense of judgement when it comes to him has never exactly been the best. Everyone deserves second chances, or even more. He’s had hundreds. It’s difficult for people to change without dramatic examples influencing them to do so. If that fight wasn’t a dramatic enough example for him, then…I guess that’s just how it goes. There’s a limit to how much you can help people who can’t even help themselves. I know that, because I was that kind of person for years. You helped me realize that everyday I need to try and be better than who I was yesterday.”

“Izuku, you’re pretty much the peak of being a good person. I don’t think it’s possible for you to be better than you were.”

“We both know that’s not true,” Izuku shook his head, sighing as he put a hand on his cheek, still remembering the feeling of the burning fist against his face like it was yesterday. “...That was the day it finally set-in for me. I think it was where I had to fully accept being quirkless.”

“It didn’t look like you were given much choice.”

“Mm, well I didn’t have a choice to begin with, but that certainly fast-tracked it.”

Kyouka furrowed her brow, Izuku’s past words echoing from her memory, “...No one is born equal.”

Izuku looked back at her, nodding his head solemnly. The world began to form again, the playground coming back, but Katsuki and his goons were gone. Izuku was laying down on the sand, staring up at the sun, scratches, bruises and burns covering his body. “Yeah. This is where I understood that. I was born for an uphill battle I couldn’t win. Not alone, that is. But…I was alone. Whether that be because of everyone else, or because I pushed others away, I was alone.”

Kyouka looked down at Izuku on the ground, not even moving. She still was a little conflicted about ‘changing’ things, but…

The sun was suddenly blocked out of little Izuku’s vision. He turned his head, seeing little Kyouka standing above him. “You okay?”

“...No,” Izuku replied, his voice hoarse and quiet, on the verge of tears.

“...Me neither.” Kyouka sat down next to him, sighing as she took off her backpack. She rummaged around in it, eventually pulling out a little box of band-aids. She pulled one out, carefully peeled off the paper, and stuck the band-aid on one of the cuts on Izuku’s arm. She looked inside the box again, humming to herself, “I don’t think I have enough band-aids.”

“That’s okay,” Izuku winced as he sat up. “You might need them in the future.”

“I need them now.” Kyouka stood up, putting her backpack on, and reaching her hand out to Izuku. “C’mon, let’s go get some more.”

Izuku looked back and forth between Kyouka’s hand and her face, tentatively taking it and being pulled to his feet. “Th-Thank you…I don’t think band-aids are gonna help me with my problems.”

“That’s okay,” Kyouka shrugged, one of her jacks wrapping around Izuku’s finger. “I’ll help with the rest.”

“B-...B-But what about you? You said you weren’t okay?”

“It’s not important.”

“Yes, it is.”

Kyouka pursed her lips, smiling a little as her jack poked his nose, “Fine. But, band-aids first, Pine-Tree.”

She started walking, taking Izuku with her. “Do you have to call me those names?”

“Yep.”

“Hm…Okay.”

  
  
  

***~...AMP…~***

  
  
  

Once again, they watched their younger selves walk away. Izuku couldn’t help but chuckle just a bit as he looked at Kyouka, “A little on the nose with that one.”

“Shut up,” Kyouka side-eyed him, a warning jack pressed against his stomach. “They’re cute. I’d like to think it’s what I’d do, even with my own social hiccups.”

“You would’ve. You help without thinking. It’s why you’re among the best.” Kyouka blushed, nudging him with her elbow as Izuku watched as the young duo vanished around the building corner. “Is it weird that I’m rooting for those two?”

“It’d be weird if you weren’t.”

“Mm. Alright, we might as well skip ahead some years. Nothing of much interest happens until middle school.”

“What about stuff with your dad?”

“Like I said, nothing of much interest happens until middle school.”

“That’s…Ouch, I guess that makes sense.”

“I’m not gonna act like his absence helped, but look at how I pushed my mom away. He would’ve gotten the same treatment. I mean, he technically did. My state of mind and where it ended up wasn’t his fault. It’d be easy to put all this blame on other people, it’s what I did for years. Blame lands on how the world works, Bakugou, and myself.”

Kyouka turned to Izuku, brow furrowed, “Huh…”

“What?”

“You called him Bakugou.”

“Oh…” Izuku sighed, “It feels wrong to call him Kacchan at this point. It’s probably been wrong to call him that for a very long time. Calling someone by their first name, much less a nickname, is meant for those close to you. That would mean I consider him as close as you, our friends, your parents…Absolutely not.”

“...How is it that I’m sad for you, yet so very proud of you at the same time?”

“It’s like realizing it’s time to tell your kid that Santa isn’t real. They’ve finally grown up, but they’re losing that child-like wonder. Except, replace child-like wonder with delusions.”

“Enough of that,” Kyouka took his hand, stopping him from going down that road. “We’re in for enough with Aldera.”

Izuku pressed his tongue against the back of his teeth, sighing, “That’s an understatement.”

  
  
  

***~...AMP…~***

  
  

**(** **Many Years Later: Aldera Junior High)**

  
  

The world shifted again, this time taking place in another location Kyouka was familiar with. They were in the same bathroom that Shigaraki had taken them to on his “Tour of Trauma.” Just another standard, beige, boring school bathroom.

The only thing of interest was the puking fourteen-year-old.

The memory of Izuku spit out the remaining bile in his mouth, slumping back against the stall wall, panting to catch his breath. The sensor on the toilet activated, automatically flushing the evidence away. 

Izuku wiped his hands off on his pants before pinching the bridge of his nose, waiting for his tension headache to go away. He’d just skip the last class, stay here. His grades were among the top of his class, despite his absences due to hiding away from it all. It wouldn’t matter missing another one. 

He knew Kacchan was looking for him, and he really wasn’t in the mood today.

Reaching over to his haphazardly thrown backpack, he pulled out Volume Twelve of his hero journals; the most recent entry. Flipping through the pages, he landed on his latest and still unfinished page: Miruko.

He had gotten the basic shapes of her sketch done, the pose he wanted, most of the basic info filled-out, everything. He just needed to finish it. He could probably get it done by the time school ended. 

Pulling out his pencil from his bag, he put the tip against the page…

But, his hand didn’t move. 

He just…couldn’t. Izuku had no energy left. He was just so tired. It had been happening more often, as of late. With each page of his journal he made, they were being finished slower and slower. Some days he didn’t even touch his journal, finding it hard to get that drive to continue. There were days where the thought of working on his journal just made him nauseous. 

Sometimes, he simply just struggled to find the point in it.

Izuku shook his head, smacking himself in the face to knock some sort of sense back into him. There was a point to it, there had to be. He just had to make it through the day.

…And then the bathroom door opened.

Surely it wasn’t-

“Fuck-Face.” Izuku sighed, closing his journal shut as he turned to look up at the bathroom’s new occupant. Katsuki was glaring down at him, smoke emanating from his fists. “We need to talk.”

“I have a feeling this involves more than talki-”

Izuku was grabbed by the front of his uniform, yanked up, and thrown against the far wal face first. “You signed-up for the mock entrance exams?”

“...Y-Yeah,” Izuku replied quietly. “Bu-”

“Shut up,” Katsuki cut him off, a light jab thrown to his gut. Izuku keeled over, but Katsuki grabbed his shoulder and shoved him back against the wall, his uniform starting to smoke. “How many times have I said that I’m the only one that’s going to UA from this shitty school? Why is it that you keep thinking you’re on the same level as me? You’re not even on the same level as the other worthless extras around here.”

“It...It’s my dream.”

“Oh, for fuck’s sake. *Your. Dream. Is. Over.* You have no fucking dream! You were born useless, and it’s gonna stay that way. I don’t fuckin’ get you, Deku. Are you just *trying* to irritate me? You always just gotta cross the line, fuck with my life, my origin story. You think I want to do this?” Katsuki scoffed as he grabbed his bag, moving to leave the bathroom. 

Izuku slumped back against the wall, holding his side as if it would stop the pain from radiating from it, “...Yes.”

Katsuki stopped in his tracks, looking back over his shoulder with a sneer, “Excuse me?”

“I think you want to do this. I think you like beating me up, cause it makes you feel better. It makes you feel powerful. But, can I ask you something?” Izuku got up, checking under his nose for blood. “...Do you think All Might would like this?”

“...”

That silence was a million words, and he was beyond thin ice, but Izuku continued anyway. Something in him just didn’t give a damn what Katuski did at that point. “Do you think All Might, our idol, our inspiration, would like you beating up someone just because they’re weaker than you? Just because you think they’re annoying? Is that really why you think he fights?”

“Shut up!” Katsuki shoved Izuku’s chest, a small explosion pushing him back against the wall and down to the floor. “What the fuck would you know? What the fuck are you ever gonna know? Actin’ like you’re ever gonna be a hero…”

Izuku got back up, not even acting like the hit fazed him, “Even if I do somehow become a hero, I’ll probably just end up dead. It’s a win-win for you, right? Out of your hair forever. Out of everyone’s hair forever…But, at least I’d be a hero for the right reasons. But, you? Number One? With how you act? How you treat people?...Never.”

Katsuki grabbed Izuku by the shirt, smoking fist raised up, *“Shut. Your. Fucking. Mouth.”*                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         

“Go on. Hit me again…What’s it gonna do?”

“...” Katsuki lowered his fist, pushing Izuku away from him. He scowled at him, shaking his head. “You’re fucking crazy. Take the test for all I care, at least it’ll be entertaining watching you fail it. Just stay in your damn lane, Deku. Keep outta mine, and we won’t have a problem.”

Izuku scoffed, picking up his backpack as Katsuki took his leave, “You’re always gonna have a problem with me. Who doesn’t?”

  
  
  

***~...AMP…~***

  
  

“How often did he beat you up?”

Izuku shrugged, his eyes never leaving his former self as he moved to the bathroom mirror, emotionless eyes staring back in his reflection. “Less than you would probably assume. As long as I kept to myself, stayed quiet, he didn’t pay any attention to me. But, on the rare occasion I actually did try to step out, talk, make a public move towards my future, well…You can see. After this, though? He never physically bullied me again. He knew that if he ever did, all he would do was prove that I was right.”

Kyouka walked over to the memory of Izuku, the scene paused. She looked into his eyes, seeing almost no light in them. “What happened before this? This moment, I mean. That wasn’t how you used to act around Bakugou. You were nervous, afraid. But, this?”

“Nothing happened before this that caused me to act this way. On this day, I mean. Some days, your mind just gets to you. You wake up, and for some reason you’re just mad. I woke up just…tired. I didn’t care what happened. I didn’t care what he did to me. I didn’t care about working on my journal. I was…I don’t know. Empty, I guess.”

“Izuku, you had depression. *Severe* depression. I-...” Kyouka furrowed her brow, and Izuku instantly recognized the look.

He gently took her arm, shaking his head, “Wait, just…Don’t intervene this time.”

“You sure?”

“Yeah. Yeah, I…Maybe you were right.” The world began to shift again, Izuku’s past-self vanishing before his eyes. “Not everything can be sugar-coated…”

"...Why do you like the Hero World so much?"

Izuku turned to her, furrowing his brow at the sudden question, "I don't think I follow."

"What I mean is…" Kyouka did her best to think about her words carefully so she didn't sound like she was asking the underlying thought she was having. "Shouldn't you, I don't know…It's just that looking back on your past, I'm surprised you kept wanting to be a hero after how the world treated you. I mean, you were discriminated against. Sure, you have a quirk now, but it still happened. And, I'm sure many of the other quirkless people in the world are treated the same way."

“So were you.”

“I was picked on like a handful of times. I was so little I can only really remember the one time. Not to mention my mutation is barely even noticeable. At a glance, you'd probably never see them.”

“Sure, not to the same extent, but you were, and here you are. You still could be by someone, and you shouldn't have to hide them in the first place. They're beautiful. And I…I'm realizing this still doesn't make my position make sense,” Izuku sighed, shrugging his shoulders as he continued to write, "I love heroes, and I want to save people. I never said l loved the world those heroes and people live in."

"Well, don't you want to change that?"

"Of course I do. I always have. I'll do everything I can, but…" Izuku looked solemnly down, shaking his head, "I think it's just too late. For me, I mean. Heteromorphs will always have a fighting chance, but quirkless? Quirkless population dwindles every year. Both by quirk genes taking over, and by…the ones that couldn't handle the cards they were dealt. We're a dying breed, and eventually we won't even exist, outside of an extremely small number. It'll reach the point where nobody will ever be able to understand us. It's already bordering on that line, if not already crossed it. To be born nothing in a world of everything."

"You weren't n-..." Kyouka wanted so badly to counter that, but she could see in Izuku’s eyes that he wasn't changing his opinion. She would be trying to comment on something she didn't understand. 

Because he was right. She never would know that feeling. No one she knew would. Even All Might was born during a time where quirkless were much more common. He wasn't seen as odd. But, Izuku wasn’t just born during a time where quirks were by far the dominant trait. He was born to two parents with quirks, and still came out with nothing. 

There had to be other quirkless in Japan. Hell, even in Musutafu. But, she had never heard of them. Nobody she knew had ever met one. It was like…

They didn't even exist.

"I'll do what I can, when I have a loud enough voice," Izuku continued. "But, I'll always feel a little guilty, because I'm the only lucky one who made it out. And, I'm sworn to secrecy as to how. Really, all I can hope for is that the other quirkless, wherever they are, can find the happiness I couldn’t. There have been times where I…I almost wish I didn’t take the power. If I did somehow, just somehow, become a quirkless hero, then I would’ve proved everyone wrong. I would’ve been an inspiration for anyone else like me in the world. But, I know that realistically, it just wouldn’t be enough. There are people who were born quirkless, or with a quirk deemed useless, and were still born with less or more opportunities than me. Hell, my father works for the HPSC. If I wasn’t so stupidly delusional, I probably could’ve had strings pulled for me. When I say nobody is born equal, I don’t mean certain groups like quirk and quirkless, rich and poor. Every single individual is born unequal to the other. I don’t…I don’t know if I can, or even if I should, fix that. That’s just life, isn’t it? But, it can cause so much pain, and the whole point of being a hero is to…I don’t know. I’m rambling.”

“I get it,” Kyouka nodded, caressing his cheek, “You have every reason to hate the world, want nothing more than to hurt the ones who hurt you for no reason, but…You’re just you. All you want is to save the world. I guess I didn’t believe someone like you existed until I met you.”

“I’m unbelievable?” Izuku joked, calling back to before their first kiss.

“Mhmhm. Yes, unbelievable.”

“Thank you. But, I definitely did have my moments of hating the world. Or, I guess it was more like spite…”

**(** **Some Weeks Later: Midoriya Family Apartment** **)**

  
  

Rain pelted against the windows, the soft sound of the burner flame on the stove hissing against it. Inko stood at the kitchen counter, the news playing quietly on the living room TV, letting her broth simmer as she signed the monthly bills. 

Izuku appeared from the front foyer, with Inko smiling at her son, “Hey, honey. How was your day?”

“Fine,” Izuku responded quickly, the hood of his raincoat still up, speed-walking to the hallway, keeping his face slightly turned away from her as he beelined it for the bathroom. 

 “Stop.” Inko instantly stood up straight, and Izuku froze, his foot just barely in the hallway. “Turn towards me.”

Izuku sighed, “Mom, it’s really not what you think.”

“Izuku…”

He grimaced, biting the inside of his cheek as he turned back towards her. Inko walked around the counter, walking to Izuku. She gently put her hands under the hood, moving it down. “I-I know you’re going to assume the worst, so I-”

“Izuku?! What happened?” Inko gasped as she saw the bruise and small cut on the side of his face, just under his temple.

“Mom, I fell into my locker door. I swear on everything. You can even see the indentation of the handle, see?” Izuku showed off his wound, and to be completely fair, there was a perfect, rectangular indent of what seemed like a locker handle on his face. “I tripped on my way to put my stuff away. That’s all, really.”

Inko kept staring at the wound in deep thought, clearly unconvinced. Technically, Izuku had proof that it was a locker. He didn’t look hurt anywhere else, he didn’t walk with a limp, he didn’t smell like smoke. 

He just always had some sort of excuse. The school never told her anything, no parents had any clue if anything was happening. 

The only time she had ever fully known of Izuku being in a fight was all those years ago, when Izuku came home from the playground burned and bruised all over. Izuku never said a word about what happened, but she knew. Who else could it have been?

She had gone right to the Bakugou house, and Mitsuki was fuming when she was told. But, Bakugou denied everything too. 

But, after all these years, she never let it go. But, she had hit every brick wall. 

“...Izuku, I’ve been thinking.”

Izuku closed his eyes, clicking his teeth together, seemingly already knowing where this was headed, “About what?”

“If you don’t want to talk to me, I understand why you wouldn’t. We don’t need to go into that, but…Why don’t you talk to somebody? Therapy, or another quirkless person? There are people and groups online, that-”

Izuku sighed, cutting her off, scratching at his brow, “Mom, I’m fine. It was just a locker, I promise.”

“I’m not talking about the locker anymore. I think it could really help, maybe even figure out what path you want to take.”

…Figure out a path.

Because the path he wanted to walk down went nowhere.

What would talking to someone even do for him? He could talk about how much life sucks, how the world is unfair, how his dreams were cut down and nobody supports him. 

It wouldn’t stop the bullying. It wouldn’t help him become a hero. It wouldn’t help him feel happy about that fact. 

The best that would happen is accepting it. Not being happy with it, but accepting it. 

Perhaps he truly was that stubborn, and he was. Perhaps after all these years, Bakugou was getting to him. Perhaps he was too hopeful. Perhaps he was too delusional. Perhaps, deep down, he was just so spiteful to the world.

But, to him, that just sounded like giving up. 

One thing he promised himself never to do was give up.

He’d follow his dream, even if it killed him.

“...I’m fine.”

  
  
  

***~...AMP…~***

  
  
  

Izuku shook his head as the memory faded away, “One of many lies I told her, and myself. Although, to be fair, the first part wasn’t a lie. I did hit my face against my locker…It just so happens that I was shoved into it.”

Kyouka raised a brow, “I thought you said Bakugou never hurt you physically again?”

“That’s because it wasn’t him,” Izuku sighed. “I didn’t even see who did it, but Bakugou was nowhere to be found. Just a push to my back, it could’ve been anyone. Like I said, Bakugou typically ignored me as long as I kept to myself. But, his influence was wide. Everyone thought he was cool, so going after me was seen as cool too. Maybe they wanted to impress him, I don’t know. Their reasons didn’t exactly matter to me. Again, it wasn’t as often as you probably think, but it doesn’t suddenly erase the many times it did happen.”

“Mm…Would you consider it now?”

“Consider what?”

“You know…Therapy?”

Shaking his head, Izuku turned back to her, “I’m fine…Wait, I mean I’m actually fine. Not like that memory. You’re all I need.”

“Izuku, you know I do absolutely everything I can for you, but I’m no professional.”

“I trust you more than a professional. You’re the only person I’m comfortable sharing this with. Hell, you’re the one person I *can* share this with. Half of my problems need the context of One For All, and doctor-patient confidentiality is nothing but the honor system. I’ve been doing great all year. I’m happier than I’ve ever been in my entire life. My mom and I are doing great, I have friends who actually care about me, I’m being taught and am close to my idol, and I have the greatest thing to ever happen to me. AKA: You. My dad and Bakugou have been my only hiccups, and we’ve found some common ground on the former. Once Bakugou is cut from my life, then almost everything about my life is amazing. I’m doing just fine without a therapist.”

Kyouka pursed her lips, taking Izuku’s hand and hugging his arm, “I can’t force you. If it truly makes you uncomfortable, then don’t go. I can’t exactly say I don’t get it. I definitely need it too, but I don’t wanna go either. But, it just sounds like we’re trying to justify not getting help to ourselves.”

“It’d be different if we were alone, had no one to be transparent with. We have each other, which is far more than many have. We’re each other’s therapy. And, yeah, I know that sounds…naive, to put it lightly. But, no one can argue with the results.”

“You’re right, I can’t. But…Just promise me that you’ll tell me if you ever feel even an inkling of depression again. If being alone in therapy is the problem, we’ll go together.”

“I promise,” Izuku nodded, leaning his head against hers. “...Unfortunately, the next memory I can think of really makes everything I just said seem wrong.”

  
  
  
  

***~...AMP…~***

  
  
  

**(** **Some Weeks Later: Aldera Junior High Rooftop** **)**

  
  

Izuku sat back against the rooftop air conditioning unit, open backpack next to him, journal in hand. 

He had managed to scrap together some more creativity over the last couple weeks, and he had thankfully been left alone for a while. He was always grateful for the periods of time where everyone got bored of messing with him. 

He had already been told not to come up here anymore, but he was finding it extremely hard to care. It was the only place he found any moment of actual peace. Even when nobody was paying him any mind, just being around so many people made him feel like he was on the verge of a panic attack.

They might be leaving him alone for the moment, but at any moment the trigger could be pulled. So, even when nobody was after him, this was the one spot where everybody forgot about him. That was something he was always at odds with himself about. 

He didn’t want to be forgotten, but it was the only way he could have some semblance of normalcy. Or, whatever normal was to him. Being alone with his thoughts honestly wasn’t much better. 

He could even escape himself. 

Izuku sighed, shaking the thoughts out of his head as he slumped back against the metal, turning to look out over the cityscape. 

He didn’t really know why he thought of it now. He didn’t know what spurred him to stand up and walk to the edge. He just found himself standing on the ledge, looking down at the world. It wasn’t until the wind blew in his ears, his gaze falling down the ground below, that he realized what he had done. 

Izuku’s heart skipped a beat as he stepped down, backing up from the ledge, a hand on his chest against his beating heart. Izuku sighed, moving back towards the air conditioning unit and sitting down, going back to writing in his journal as if nothing ever happened. 

  
  
  
  

***~...AMP…~***

  
  
  

“You said you never considered it,” Kyouka frowned as she turned back to Izuku.

“I didn’t. Like I said, they were just thoughts. I had no intention of actually doing it. Yes, I know,” Izuku put his hand out, stopping Kyouka from retorting. “Again, I know how that sounds, but I didn’t *want* to die. I couldn’t just give up like that. It wasn’t a part of my programming. But, sometimes…you can’t help but wonder. You’ll never flip that switch, open that door, whatever you want to call it. But, you always wonder what might happen if you did. It would’ve been an easy escape. But…You know me. I’ve never been one to run away. Heroes run forward, and…Heroes don’t make the easy choice.”

Kyouka bit behind her lip, taking a deep breath as she looked up at him, “You’re the strongest person I know, you know that?”

Izuku scoffed, but chuckled a bit, “Kyouka, I’m showing you at my weakest.”

“You’re wrong. You’re showing me how you stood strong throughout a personal Hell where most others would’ve broken long ago.”

“I-...I-I don’t know. I’m certain that if our situations were reversed, you wouldn’t have done it either.”

“If I was born quirkless, I still had a nepo-baby doorway wide open for me with music. With my parents, I was basically guaranteed a career no matter what.”

“Yet, you still chose to be a hero. Because, like I said, heroes don’t make the easy choice. And, let’s be real, Kyouka. I had an open doorway into the HPSC with my dad. Despite what we probably know about them now, it would be a well respected, high-paying job that works closely to heroes. I could’ve been an artist,” Izuku scoffed as he motioned towards the memory of himself drawing in his journal. “Do you know how many heroes need artists for their promotional work? I had literal books of resumes. I wasn’t strong enough to wake myself up from a fantasy.”

“You see, right there. You’ve completely flipped the opposite direction from where you were with your mom. Your resentment for her not believing in your dream, has now completely shifted over to resenting yourself for not wanting to give up on your dreams. You seem to be forgetting the third factor in this that we’ve been watching the entire time. The fact that quite literally everybody around you was pushing you down; all day, every day. You think being all alone, whether you pushed certain people away or not…” Kyouka quickly added in, before Izuku went to blame himself again. “...You think being all alone did you any favors? You still got this far, purely because you were strong enough to hold out on your own. Yes, you’re not entirely blameless. You know it, and I know it. But, that stupid fucker Bakugou, every dumb asshole in your school, and the treatment or lack thereof of quirkless people in society are far more to blame than you. You got through it all, flawed or not. End of story.”

“...How have you put up with me all this time?”

“I can ask you the same thing. All we seem to ever do is attack ourselves. I’m not expecting your mindset to change overnight, but strength comes in many ways. You’ve got that in spades, far above most others. Maybe in some ways it’s not the strength you originally wanted, but you sure as hell made me stronger, in more ways than one. Past delusions or not, even now you never let go of hope. Hope isn’t something you lose, it’s something that’s ripped away from you. Nobody’s ever been able to tear it from your grasp. You understand how strong that makes you, right?”

“I understand,” Izuku nodded, smiling a little. “...Thank you.”

“It’s what I do,” Kyouka shrugged, a jack poking Izuku’s abdomen. “Now, next memory.”

“...You’re really, *really* not gonna like this next one.”

Kyouka deadpanned at him, “What’d Bakugou do?”

“...”

  
  
  

***~...AMP…~***

  
  
  

**(** **Months Later: Aldera Junior High** **)**

  
  

Izuku stared out the window, the laughter of his classmates still echoing around in his mind, completely blocking out the sound of the final bell and everyone rushing out of the classroom to go home. His teacher just *had* to mention that he was applying for UA, didn’t he? He practically threw Izuku a steak while he was in a den of lions. 

Everyone laughed. The teacher did nothing.

Everyone made fun of him. The teacher did nothing.

Katsuki used his quirk on Izuku’s desk, knocking him to the ground. The teacher did nothing. 

He only existed when they wanted to be entertained. 

“Now, what’s this?” Izuku was jolted out of his own mind, turning to see Katsuki and his lackeys standing next to his desk, Hero Journal in hand. “For Future Use?”

“I-It’s nothi-” Izuku got up and reached for it, but Katsuki moved it out of reach with a sigh.

 “You know, I figured this was just a hobby or something, so I didn’t give a shit. But, of course. Why didn’t I realize it was for your waste of a dream? Literally everything you do is meant to piss me off. Let me just save us all some time…” Katsuki slammed his palm against the journal, smoke and cinders flashing against the surface. He took the burned book, nonchalantly tossing it out the window as he turned back to Izuku. He leaned forward, a hand clamping down on Izuku's shoulder, smoke billowing from between his fingers as the hiss of burning cloth hit Izuku’s ears. “I’ll speak slowly, cause clearly you’re still too dumb to get it after all this time. Don’t. Apply. For. UA. I’m so close to never having you interfere in my life ever again. So, just do me a solid, and stay down in the dirt with the rest of the extras.”

Katsuki released Izuku with an eyeroll, Naides and Rokuro chuckling behind him as they took their leave. Izuku didn’t say a word, his eyes looking out the window, locked onto his burnt notebook down below, floating with the koi in the fountain. 

As Katsuki reached the door, he looked back over his shoulder, a smirk on his lips. “Hey, I’ve got an idea. You want a quirk so bad? Take a swan dive off the roof of the building. Maybe you’ll get one in your next life.”

Izuku spun around, fury etched onto his face for just a brief moment, but no words came out. He just let them go, leaving him all alone in the classroom. He shut his eyes, a shaky sigh escaping his lips as he sat back down, head in his hands. He ran his hands down his face, deciding to sit and wait for the rest of the students to leave the halls and go home. 

He didn’t feel much like going home anyway. 

He didn’t feel like being anywhere.

Eventually, the bustling noise from the halls turned to silence, allowing Izuku some form of peace of mind to go to his locker. He walked out the door, standing still. 

To his right, the way to his locker.

To his left, the roof exit.

Izuku refused to look left. 

He turned right. 

  
  
  

***~...AMP…~***

  
  

As the memory faded, Izuku raised a brow as Kyouka didn’t say anything. She was staring silently, a slight twitch in her lips.

“...Nothing?”

Kyouka took a deep, shaky breath, as her jaw tense, “He’s done it. He’s truly done it. He’s pissed me off into silence. I have no remarks; nothing.”

“...I feel like you’re also kind of mad at me.”

“I’m not mad at you, I just-... *Why?”* Kyouka seethed out, “Why did you ever defend him?”

“I-”

“I know you see him for what he is. Society, circumstance, I know. I know he’s not the worst person in the world, and doesn’t even make the top one-hundred-thousand. I know he was younger and stupider, and holding a fourteen-year-old accountable has its limits. I know you admired aspects about him. But, I-...With everything you were feeling, everything he’s done…How? How did you ever defend him? Not anyone else, *you* personally.”

“Explaining doesn’t mean defending. I’ve never defended him, I just understand what he is. I knew I couldn’t do anything. Nobody ever believed the delusional quirkless kid. Nobody ever cared.”

“You have plenty of people who will believe you now.”

“With what proof? They can’t expel Bakugou for something he was never written up for, they have no proof of, and something that didn’t even happen at their school. Even if we could do that, I don’t want to expel him. I’m not gonna stoop down to their level and stop someone from achieving their dream. Asshole or not, you can’t deny that Bakugou will save a lot of lives as a hero. He may not actually care about any of them, but he’ll still save them.”

Kyouka bit her lip, frowning down at her feet, “Stood down to their level…”

Izuku raised a brow, “You okay?”

“Yeah. Yeah, I just…I’m so sorry. I should’ve just let the fucker fizzle out. Gone to our room, lock the door, I don’t know…” Kyouka crossed her arms, anger from the fight still lingering somewhere within. “...I stooped down to his level.”

“No, you didn’t. You didn’t ask for that fight.”  
  

“I practically did. I was pretty much itching for a chance to hit him.”

“After he attacked first, even if it wasn’t a hit meant to instigate a fight. He still hit first. If he never attacked you, would you have fought him?”

“Well, no, but-”

“But, what? You hate him far more than he hates you, yet you’re the one who had the self-control to speak to him. Angrily, but still. It’s not like he treated you with any more respect, and it’s not like he deserves it. You never would’ve even been there if he didn’t want to drag me out for a fight. He struck first. The rest is a domino effect of his actions.”

“But, I-...There’s something else.” Kyouka sighed, running hand down her face. “I was gonna stop you. I had caught up to you guys in the parking garage. But…But, I didn’t. When I heard about…When I heard about what he had done, the things he made you think, I…I wanted you to hurt him. All I wanted was for you to deal back triple the pain he’s caused you.”

“Kyouka…”

“I knew how much you hated that part of yourself, the part that gets so angry. I’m the one who cleaned your knuckles after you punched that asshole with the wings. I’m the one that’s supposed to pull you back to yourself. It’s my job, but…I didn’t. All because I stooped down to his level.”

“Kyouka…” Izuku gripped her shoulders, making sure her focus was on him. “It’s human. That’s all it is. You said it yourself, in your room after I punched Kubi. These feelings are normal, even if you don’t like what they do to you. You didn’t stoop down to his level, not in the slightest. You did what you did, because you love me. He did what he did, because he was insecure and angry. And, what I said about stooping down to someone’s level, it’s not some holier than thou rule to follow. It’s just something to *try* and do. If you did, then I definitely did. It all started because I saw that he hurt you. I wanted to hurt him too, and I did. I’m sure your parents would personally kill anyone who dared to hurt you. You want stooping down to his level? A part of me is glad we can’t expel Bakugou, because I want him to personally see us surpass his rank. You know spite is the absolute last reason I want to be a hero, but I can’t deny that feeling is still there inside. It’s human, that’s all it is.”

“That doesn’t make what I did right.”

“I guess not, but the same could be said for me. I’ve never wanted to hurt anyone like that, but I just…gave in. You didn’t need me to defend you. By the time I got there, it was obvious that you had done a number on him. You’re strong, a great fighter, quick on your feet…I could’ve just stopped the fight, and left him there. But, I snapped. I attacked unprovoked. I have eleven-years-worth of reasons to do so, but even still. I went completely overkill on him. Neither one of us were exactly heroic back there.”

“Pfft,” Kyouka finally smiled again, looking up at him. “If *you* weren’t acting heroic, then I was doomed.”

“Enough of that. Kyouka, there’s nothing you do that isn’t heroic. You hate Bakugou, but you still fought him to stop him from getting to me. You taunt him because he acts horrible to everyone, including you and the people you care about. You saved him from Shigaraki. If I wasn’t there, and you were still given the chance, would you have still saved him?”

“...Hate is a very weak word, but it doesn’t mean I want to see him dead.”

“That’s a long way of saying ‘yes’, but I’ll take it,” Izuku chuckled, Kyouka smiling too. “Kyouka, you have spent the entire year saving me from myself. Without hesitation, without asking for anything in return, even when I was too oblivious to see you needed saving from yourself too. We faltered tonight, but it’s gonna happen again someday. We just have to do our best, like we always have.”

Kyouka bit the inside of her cheek, but still nodded, “Right…We will. I won’t make that mistake again. I might not have started all this, but I’m still partially responsible for dragging you back down to the part of you that you hate the most. In my eyes, at least. If you ever go down that path again, I’ll do everything I can to pull you back to me.”

“With how everyone says we’re attached at the hip, I doubt that’ll be too hard,” Izuku laughed a bit. “I don’t know if it helps, but I’m very grateful that you felt that way because you love me so much.”

“Yeah, yeah…” Kyouka waved him off dismissively, a blush dusting her cheeks. “Enough distracting me with your charm. We’ve gotta be almost done with everything really dark. All Might should be coming along soon, right?”

Izuku opened his mouth to respond, but closed it, looking off to the side as the memory started flooding into his mind, and subsequently into the void around them. “Unfortunately, meeting All Might isn’t where it ends. Ironically, it was probably my darkest point of all. It didn’t last long, and what followed was perfect, but for a split-second I…Let’s just jump to there. I’ve told you about the next memory. Attacked by a sludge monster, All Might saved me, I grabbed onto his leg, etc. But, there’s a detail about this day that I never told you…”

  
  
  

***~...AMP…~***

  
  
  

**(** **Later That Day: Downtown Musutafu Rooftop** **)**

  
  

“Do you think I can be a hero?”

Toshinori stopped, looking back at Izuku. He gazed at the boy, puzzled, merely shrugged, “Why couldn’t you be?”

“I-...I-I’m quirkless.” Toshinori seemed to perk up at that reveal, turning his body fully back towards Izuku as he listened. Izuku’s gaze moved down to his feet, taking a deep breath as he tried to speak as clearly as he could. “All I ever wanted was to be like you. Helping people, doing everything I could, just because it was right. I…I’ve been told my whole life that it was impossible. First it was illegal for quirkless people to even apply for Hero Schools, but even now that I can, I’ve heard about the entrance exams. They’re not exactly made for people like me. I-I…I just…Do I even have a chance? I-I know I don’t look like much, but I…I think I just need to finally hear it from you. If I truly went for it, dedicated myself, trained hard…Do you think I could become a hero?”

The wind blew past them, the only thing keeping the silence from dominating the atmosphere. Toshinori’s brow was furrowed as he tried to think of how to answer him. Izuku knew the situation wasn’t exactly ideal for All Might, especially after his secret was just exposed to some random kid. But, the long pause was becoming more and more concerning by the second. 

Until, finally…

“A quirkless hero…” Toshinori bit the inside of his cheek, closing his eyes as he sighed. Opening them again, it was clear there was guilt in his gaze. A sign that instantaneously gave Izuku his answer. “...No, I don’t think so. I’m sorry.”

Izuku didn’t breathe.

He didn’t blink. 

He couldn’t feel his heart beating anymore.

He couldn’t hear All Might, the words “police officer” barely registering in Izuku’s mind as eleven-years worth of holding on finally caught up to him. Before he even knew it, All Might had taken his leave.

He was all alone.

  
  
  

***~...AMP…~***

  
  
  

“He told you no?” Kyouka raised a brow, turning back to Izuku. 

“Don’t be mad at him. He was being honest, Kyouka.” His eyes moved back and forth as he watched her pace, figuring this was going to happen. “He was right.”

Kyouka stopped her pacing, turning back to Izuku with crossed arms, “We’ve had this conversation before.”

“We did, and I still haven’t changed my mind.”

“You could’v-”

“Kyouka, give me one villain we’ve fought that I would’ve stood even a modicum of a chance against quirkless. Just one.”

“Stain.”

Izuku scoffed, “Yeah, sure.”

“He’s a guy with swords. Yes, you could’ve.”

“Mhm. Illegally, you mean?”

Kyouka’s brow furrowed, peering at him, “What do you mean?”

“I mean, vigilantism is illegal. I certainly wouldn’t have my license, because there’s no way in Hell I would’ve passed the Entrance Exams. You experienced them yourself. I would’ve died, much less failed.”

“What about gear? You could ju-”

“Gear is only available to registered students and heroes. I suppose my real failure was never learning how to make my own.”

“I-...” Kyouka sucked in her cheeks, her brow furrowed as she bubbled in frustration. 

Izuku sighed, gently rubbing his hands up and down Kyouka’s arms, “I’m not going to say it was impossible, and I love you so much for believing in me. I’m just saying the world wasn’t doing me any favors. I certainly wasn’t doing myself any favors either…You were slightly wrong earlier, about me never having hope ripped from me. This…This is the first and only moment in my life, where I didn’t have hope.”

“But, I mean…You still walked away.”

“Hm?”

Kyouka turned back to the memory of Izuku, still just standing there. “I…It’s dark, I know, but you still left. You’re alone, on a rooftop. It’s the same day that Bakugou told you to…you know. Hearing that from All Might seems like far more than the straw that broke the camel's back. So-...Oh…”

Kyouka stopped as the memory of Izuku began walking forward, stepping up onto the ledge. Izuku put a hand on her arm, shaking his head, “It’s okay. I never did this…”

Kyouka peered at him, looking back and forth between the two Izukus. This was him altering his memory, just like she had been doing. He may not have done this, but the thought was carved into his mind. It would always be there, somewhere. 

Izuku walked over to the ledge, standing behind his former self. “We both know you don’t wanna do this.”

The younger Izuku didn’t turn back, just continuing to look down at the ground below, “... Why wouldn’t we?”

“Well, for starters, I’m you. I’m fully aware of what you want and don’t want. Secondly, you haven’t given mom any form of goodbye, and I know the idea of her seeing your dead body is running rampant through your mind right now. That’s already enough to stop you. Third, I’m many things. Stubborn, awkward, anxious, optimistic to a fault…but, I’m not stupid. And, that…” Izuku pointed down at the pavement down below. “...That’s stupid.” 

The younger Izuku growled in irritation, finally turning towards him, “Why are you doing this?”

Izuku shrugged, “I don’t know, I’m crazy? We made some of these other memories feel better, so I just thought I’d give it a try myself. We’ve always had other people have to get through our stubborn, thick skulls. Kyouka, All Might, Mom, Nana…It’s far past time I do this myself. Don’t worry, I’ll still need Kyouka to save me from my own stupid mind for the rest of my life. Talking to myself isn’t going to be a common occurrence.” 

“B-...B-But…” The younger Izuku bit his wobbling lip, tears springing to his eyes as he turned back to look down. “...But…what’s the point? Why keep going? They were right. They were all right. What’s there to go back to? Go on, live some life I’m not happy with? Spend decades living the same cycle over and over again? It’s not living, it’s a waste of life. That’s all I am…”  
  

“That’s not-”

“Don’t you dare tell me that’s not true!” He spun around, jabbing a finger at his older self, tears spilling over. “You know it. I know it. We were born *nothing* . *I’m nothing.”*

“That’s our problem. We were born nothing, and we just accepted that.”

“I-? What? Accepted it? We could never accept it.”

“No, we accepted it from the moment we were diagnosed. You spent eleven years writing in that journal, not training, not studying gear, finding any sort of way to realistically make that dream even slightly possible. Our journals were never our ticket in. It was life support. It kept us alive for so long. It was hope. Hope that someone or something would come along, and change our lives. We just needed to hold out long enough. I know it’s not all your fault. Not even a majority of it was. We were pushed and beaten down, berated. We might not have lost hope, but nobody had hope in us. But, at the end of the day, we spent a decade waiting for someone to come and save us…I never even bothered to try and save myself.” Izuku grabbed his former-self’s shirt, yanking him down and stepping up on the ledge himself. 

“Wh-?! Wait, what are you-?!” Izuku turned around and fell back right off the ledge. “N-No! Wait!” 

Memory Izuku jumped forward and grabbed his older-self’s arm, the latter’s feet just barely on the ledge as he was being held up. “Why are you saving me? This is what you wanted, right?”

“N-No!” Memory Izuku grunted as he struggled to hold him up. “I-I…I-I don’t know…”

“You moved without thinking.”

“Wh-?! Yeah, so?”

Izuku shifted his feet forward, allowing himself to be pulled back up. He grabbed his memory by the shoulders, looking him dead in the eye, “I’m always gonna need help. It wasn’t all my fault. Most people can’t save themselves alone, and I’m no different. But, at the end of the day, the person truly responsible for me, is me. We didn’t put in the effort either. You want your life to mean something? You want to matter? You want to prove the world wrong, be a hero to someone? Anyone? Then try. All you had to do was try. And, if you failed? Then, at least you failed with no excuses. None to yourself, that is. You can’t quit life before you even have the chance to live one. I know it’s easy for me to say. Life turned around, we got lucky. Very, *very* lucky, but hindsight is twenty/twenty, I suppose.”

Izuku sighed, sitting down on the ledge as his former-self stood still in front of him. “...Why’d you do this? I’m not real. You’re just talking to yourself.”

“Uh-huh,” Izuku nodded, chuckling dryly. “But, if I’m talking to myself, then you know the answer…I’m tired of the person I hate most being myself. I’ve always been ashamed of you. Who I was a year ago and who I am now is night and day. But, it doesn't change the fact I’m still me. It doesn’t change that all these regrets are still mine and mine alone. All I ever wanted to do was forget you…But, I can’t abandon anyone who needs help.”

The younger Izuku pursed his lips, shifting on his feet, “...It really does get better?”

  
  

“Exhibit A,” Izuku motioned over to Kyouka, who had been completely silent throughout the whole endeavor. 

Memory Izuku looked over at Kyouka, his brow furrowing as he looked back at real Izuku, “You're lying…”

“Saying as I was literally in your shoes, I would’ve thought I was lying too. But, it’s true.”

Memory Izuku leaned down to talk to himself privately, speaking in a hushed tone, *“That's the most beautiful girl I've ever seen. There's no way we managed that. The last time we even spoke to a girl was…Uh…Oh my God, have I never talked to a girl?”*

“Hmhmhm, nope. But, trust me, the wait is far more than worth it. Now, don’t you have somewhere to be?”

“Hm?”

***\*BOOM!!!\****

A few blocks away, an explosion rang out, light and smoke billowing above the cityscape. Memory Izuku’s eyes widened, rushing for the roof exit and vanishing without another word, the memory continuing as normal. 

Izuku looked up as Kyouka finally moved again. She sat down next to him, her arms wrapping around his as she leaned her head on his shoulder. He pressed his face into her hair, a brow raised, “Anything to add?”

Kyouka looked back up, shaking her head, and softly kissing his lips. “...You said it all.”

“Mm. That was…very weird.”

“You just yelled at yourself. Yeah, it was weird. Extremely proud of you, all the same, no matter how utterly insane that was. But, that’s okay. We thrive on crazy.”

“We do,” Izuku scoffed. “I thought we did everything to avoid crazy, but it always finds us.”

“Oh, no. We’re nuts. We’re two different twigs on the same branch, Izuku. You and All Might are on the same one, though.”

“What do you mean?”

Kyouka chuckled, “You two are legitimately insane. Izuku, I love you more than anything. In the time that I’ve known you, I’ve learned a lot. About you, life, heroics, everything. But, if I had to draw one conclusion from it all? It’s that you’re the craziest bastard I’ve ever met.”

“Wh-? C’mon, I can’t be that bad. I’m just doing what I think is right.”

“Oh, don’t get me wrong, I love that about you. But, you’re the guy that broke his arms *twice in the same fight* , and continued to fight across camp. You’re the guy that ran at a sludge monster without a moment’s hesitation. You’re the guy that refused to win against Shoto in the tournament until he used his left side. You went into the Entrance Exams without even knowing how to use your quirk. Before you even knew Shigaraki had taken Bakugou to Aldera, you were gonna run your own rescue operation into the League’s hideout. You’ve analyzed and documented over one-thousand heroes and their quirks. You were told that you might have to fight All For One, the most dangerous man to ever live, and your only concern was that you thought you’d have to break up with me. You absorbed the electricity from the UA grid to pass a test that we could’ve passed by running. You wanna know the funniest part? I don’t even think I’ve seen your craziest. You haven’t been given the means to yet.”

Izuku blinked a couple times, stunned into silence. He had been called crazy before, but saying all of this out loud…

“What do you mean I haven’t been given the means?”

“I fully believe you would spend every second of everyday running around saving lives, purely because you want to,” Kyouka shrugged. “Hell, you’re probably gonna be so fast that you’ll just run to other countries when they have a world-ending crisis, and be back for dinner. Your heart could stop beating, and you’d just keep fighting as long as you could save just one more life. You were specifically chosen to be given this power by All Might, the man that stopped millions of crimes by himself, and fought All For One with his guts hanging out of his body. He saw something in you. He saw something in you. He saw that you were utterly insane, just like him. I think that once you reach your prime, you’re gonna just smile and laugh at every danger that comes your way.”

“W-...Wow. Thanks…I think,” Izuku scoffed, chuckling a bit. He took Kyouka’s hands in his own, his brow furrowed with concern. “I don’t stress you out too much, do I?”

“Pfft, are you kidding me? I’m freaking insane too. I’ve also joined all this bullshit without any sort of hesitation. You have All Might’s quirk? Sure. There’s a villain that could just straight up end the world? Yep, got it. I’ve gotta fight him someday? Izuku, I was begging the universe to give me the means to enter a deathmatch with him, and now I do. Have I been scared? Yeah, definitely. But, I’ve never even questioned it. Not really, anyway. Trust me, I’m crazy. I tried to punch Muscular, like that was gonna do anything. I fought All Might *before* I got these powers. Every single batshit crazy thing you do, I’m right there next to you. When I’m not doing something crazy on my own, that is. I’ve gotta keep us, after all.” Kyouka kissed his shoulder, nuzzling into it. “But, all this insanity doesn’t mean much without you. Thank you for showing me this.”

“I should’ve told you a long time ago. But, don’t worry. Now the only thing I’m willing to die for is you, and this world so you can keep living in it.”

“Yeah? Well, I don’t want to live in a world without you in it, and I get a strong feeling you have the same sentiment about me. So, it seems like we’re at a crossroads.”

“That we are.” Izuku kissed the top of her head, moving to stand back up. “Ok, let’s get some real sleep.”

“Actually…” Kyouka stopped him, the memory beginning to fade. “Before we back out…It’s my turn. There’s something I want to show you.”

“Kyouka, you don’t have to-”

“You’ve shown me everything. I don’t have a story like yours, but there’s still something I need you to see. I don’t want anything else hidden between us anymore. Everything should be out in the open. You and I have always shared everything, and now you’ve shown me your darkest points.” Kyouka closed her eyes, the void around them beginning to take shape for one last time. “You deserve to see mine too.”

  
  
  
  

***~...AMP…~***

  
  

**(** **Twelve-Years-Ago** **)**

A classroom formed that Izuku didn’t recognize, filled with tons of children he didn’t recognize either. Dark blue and gray walls, a beige carpet, circular tables in one corner, and all the usual things one would see in a classroom for small children. Cubbies, simple spelling and math charts on the wall, an assortment of different toys scattered around in the corner. Nothing out of the ordinary.

They were all on the floor, watching as their teacher began writing on the whiteboard. Izuku instantly recognized a familiar head of violet hair amongst them, smiling at the image of a younger Kyouka. 

A child next to her glanced over, doing a double-take and pointing at Kyouka, “Jirou, you’ve got something on your ear.”

“Hm? Kyouka raised a brow, her hand moving up to her ear, her eyes widening as she felt a solid little nub on her earlobe. 

“Hey, there’s one on that ear too,” the child on her other side said, peering closely at it. 

Kyouka covered her other ear, feeling the same thing again. On each ear, the ends of newly formed jacks were growing in, dead skin peeling away from as new skin formed with the tips. All of the kids began to turn and stare, looking closer at Kyouka’s ears, completely overwhelming her. 

“Whoa-ho-ho, look! She’s a mutie!”

“Ew, look at those things. Gross…”

“Is that your quirk? So weird…” 

Everyone began to whisper and stare in awe. Despite being nothing but murmurs, Kyouka could hear them clear as day.

One child that stared in awe reached a finger forward to poke at her jacks. Kyouka panicked, smacking his hand away. “Ow! She hit me!”

“That’s enough,” the teacher chastised them, getting her students’ attention back. “We keep our hands to ourselves, so no poking at each other’s ears, and no hitting. And, Amamiya, we don’t use the word: mutie. Okay? Now, who can tell me wha-...”

The teacher had turned back to the board, going back to her lesson. But, it was too late. Kyouka looked around, feeling every set of eyes on her. Those who weren’t trying to sneak glances her way were unabashedly staring right at her. 

Some in awe. Some in shock. Some in disgust. 

Kyouka moved her hair back, making sure her ears were completely covered. She could still hear every whisper, keeping silent as she tried to focus on the board. 

But, she didn’t hear a word her teacher said. 

  
  
  

***~...AMP…~***

  
  
  

Izuku sighed as the memory faded away, knowing what the younger Kyouka was feeling all too well. “You told me about this day, but you didn’t say it was to such an extent.”

  
Kyouka sighed, shrugging, “Guess that makes two of us.”

“Ouch. Fair enough.”

“Sorry,” Kyouka took his hand, “I didn’t mean it like that. Some of the other kids stopped playing with me. Some kids tried to poke them, pull them. I couldn’t control them at the time, so my focus was all out of whack. But, I could hear every damn word they said about me.”

“Is this when you went home and tried to cut them?”

“No. That wasn’t for a while. My parents were so excited when I showed them that I felt bad saying that I hated them. So, I kept quiet. As the days went by, they got longer and longer. They grew faster than my hair, so eventually I couldn’t hide them anymore. It’s been too long, things are fuzzy. I don’t know what snapped in me. I just remember not being able to take it anymore…”

  
  

***~...AMP…~***

  
  
  

**(** **Twelve-Years-Ago: Kyouka’s Room** **)**

  
  

*\*Knock-Knock-Knock\**

The door to Kyouka's room opened up, revealing Mika on the other side. She looked practically the same as she did in the present, outside of her hair mostly being swept to the side. 

“Kyouka? Dinner’s re-...”  Mika stopped, a sharp gasp escaping her lips as she saw her daughter sitting down in the middle of her room, a little table of school supplies scattered out in front of her. 

All except for the scissors. 

Kyouka turned to her mother, tear-filled eyes going wide at the sight of her mother, scissors in hand, and a few small trails of blood dripping down the side of her head.

“KYOUKA!!!” Mika rushed forward, her own jacks shooting out and gripping Kyouka’s wrist, pinning her arm down on the table. She yanked the scissors out of her hand, throwing them to the side and picking up her daughter. She bulleted to the bathroom, kicking the step-stool out of the way as she set Kyouka down on the counter, grabbing the hand towel from the ring on the wall and pressing it against Kyouka’s ear. She held Kyouka’s face, looking into her eyes as tears began forming in her own. “Are you okay?”

“...Stupid question,” Kyouka mumbled. 

Mika scoffed, but she couldn’t help but shakily laugh, “Oh, if you’re already like this, you’re gonna be a nightmare when you’re older. Hold the towel for me, okay?”

Kyouka nodded, holding the towel to her head as Mika bent down and opened the bottom cabinet, pulling out the first-aid kid. She unzipped it, putting her hand over Kyouka’s. “Alright, let me see…”

She gently coaxed Kyouka’s hand away, analyzing the cuts. Thankfully, the damage seemed very minimal. Just little, shallow cuts slightly above where her jacks started. Nothing some light pressure and a couple days wouldn’t heal. 

Mika sighed in relief as one of her jacks stabbed into a cotton ball, raising up to press against Kyouka’s ear as she turned on the sink, wetting the towel to wipe the blood away. She gently pressed the towel to Kyouka’s face, her other hand slowly stroking her hair. “...Kyou, why would you do this?”

Her daughter was silent, letting tears continue to slowly far down her cheeks. Mika didn’t push her, simply waiting for a response for as long as Kyouka wished. 

*“I hate them…”* Kyouka’s wobbly voice responded quietly. *“Everyone hates them…”*

Mika bit her lip, shaking her head as she pulled her daughter to her chest, hugging her tight. “They just don’t understand them. *You* don’t understand them. Not yet. You’re too young to process this, but there will always be people who don’t like them. But, none of those people matter. I *love* your quirk. Your father loves it. You’re gonna meet plenty of people who love it, and have their own quirks like yours. People of all different shapes, sizes, colors. One day, you’ll wake up, and you’ll love it too. You’ll realize that not only can you not live without it, you don’t want to live without it. You have your momma’s quirk. So, do you hate mine?”

Kyouka pursed her lips, shaking her head, “No…I like yours.”

“Why, thank you very much. I like them too. I think they’re very pretty. But, you know what? I think yours are even better.” Mika leaned down, caressing Kyouka’s cheek. “And, no one can tell us otherwise. You know why?”

Kyouka smiled just a little, “Cause we don’t take crap from anybody.”

“Exactly,” Mika smiled back. “I taught you too well. Your daddy’s not gonna be able to handle your teenage-years.” 

Kyouka shrugged, “He signed up for this.”

“Ohoho, that’s my girl.”

  
  
  

***~...AMP…~***

  
  

As the memory faded out, Izuku rubbed Kyouka’s back, “We didn’t have to alter this one to make it nice.”

“Hmhm, yeah. Unfortunately, while my mom did stop me from hating my quirk, all those emotions just shifted to…everywhere else. Thankfully they didn’t scar…Mainly because they were safety scissors. Not to mention my jacks were way more durable than I thought. I would’ve broken the scissors before I actually did any damage. The blood was mainly from the parts of my ears I nicked in my attempts.”

“You never told me about the conversation afterwards.”

Kyouka sighed, shrugging, “I guess at the time I didn’t want to paint it as a more bittersweet memory when you were talking about your struggles. Even my darker spots had a nice ending, at least for this one. I felt bad comparing…”

Izuku turned her toward him, “I never would’ve tried to compare it. Not like that, at least. It’s not a competition.”

“I know. But, for me, the bullying stopped pretty quickly in the grand scheme of thigns. Either they grew up and realized they were being stupid, or they stopped caring and got bored. I’m just lucky that my mutation isn’t extreme. Look at Shoji, Mina, Koda, or Tokoyami. It probably has and will be a lot harder for them. And you? You spent over a decade in a living nightmare. What right do I have complaining when it wasn’t as bad for me? Most of my problems spawned from my own mind.”

“We’ve seen firsthand that some people will never grow up. There will be people who look down on you in the future, we can’t deny that. And, to be completely realistic with ourselves, we’re going to be in the spotlight. I have no doubts that AMP is going to rank very high among Pros, especially once we fully get control of our power. Since we’re a Duo, we don’t have individual rankings.”

“Ugh, why did two extreme introverts choose the job that subsequently makes us celebrities?”

“Because heroes-”

“Don’t make the easy choice, blegh,” Kyouka sarcastically waved him off.  

Izuku chuckled, taking Kyouka’s hands in his. “Your mutation might not be to the same extent as many other heteromorphs, but that doesn’t make you better or lesser than them, or any other human-being on this planet. Just like being quirkless didn’t make me better or lesser of a person than anyone else. Nobody is born equal, but at the end of the day we’re all just people with our own struggles. Everyone wants to be heard, no matter the size of said struggles. Someone once told me everyone’s issues-”

“Are their own, and are significant to them in their own ways. Yeah, I know. Unfortunately, she never quite seemed to fully learn that lesson for herself…”

“Maybe not, but I have complete faith that she will. She’s the best person I know, after all.”

Kyouka pretended to pout, grumbling, “You and your using my own words against me.” 

“You throw them out so often that you don’t expect me to toss them back.”

“Ugh, how dare you be right. Ok, I’ve had enough of this quirk for one night. Get me the hell out of here.”

Izuku chuckled as Kyouka began to become transparent, fading into the void as she awoke in the real world. 

Taking a deep breath, he followed.

The couple opened their eyes to, back in the waking world. Once again, they found themselves in darkness. 

Kyouka rubbed her eye, propping herself up on her elbow, “What time is it?”

Izuku reached back, grabbing his phone off of the nightstand, the screen lighting up like a beacon in their bedroom. “Four AM.”

Slumping back down into the pillow, Kyouka groaned into the blanket, “You were right. It feels like I haven’t slept at all, yet I’m not tired.”

Following her example of laying back down, Izuku nodded as he put his hand on her waist, “You’ll get used to it.”

They settled back into silence, the only noise coming from the ceiling fan above. Kyouka put her hand on Izuku’s arm, rubbing up and down, “You okay?”

“Yeah. You?”

Kyouka nodded, “Yeah. I think it’s safe to say we know everything about each other now.”

“Well, hopefully not everything. We need to keep things interesting for the next sixty-plus years.”

“Mhmhm. Don’t make that joke in front of the parents. They’ll take that inch and run a mile. Uh…Speaking of which, are you gonna tell them about any of this? Aizawa is gonna call them tomorrow.”

Izuku blew a raspberry, “Let’s uh…Let’s cross that bridge when we get there.”

“Fair enough,” Kyouka nodded, moving her hand up to Izuku’s cheek. “I know how hard it is to talk about.”

“It’s a lot easier after tonight. I won’t wait long, I promise.”

“...How long did it last, by the way? Your thoughts, I mean. We never really said when it stopped. After All Might found you again?”

“For the most part, yeah. But, fully? After meeting you.”

Kyouka rolled her eyes, “Even now, you gotta add your lines.”

“No, I mean it,” Izuku chuckled, pulling Kyouka into his embrace. “Even when training with All Might, I had all these fears of failing the test, failing him, failing my mom, not being worthy of this power. But, then you came along and…Everything about my life started to finally make sense.”

Kyouka scoffed, burying her face into the crook of his neck, “Izuku, quite literally nothing about our life makes sense. Everything got way crazier the moment we got together.”

“Yeah, well…Is it weird how that’s kind of how I like it?”

Kyouka furrowed her brow, thinking for a moment, “...Nah. But…I could’ve lost you before I ever even found you; before we could’ve had this crazy life.”

“That doesn’t matter now, because you’re never getting rid of me.”

Kyouka hugged him tighter, raising her head up, “...Promise?”

“...I promise,” Izuku nodded. 

Kyouka smiled, her thumb caressing his cheekbone, “I love you…”

Izuku smiled back, leaning in, “I love you too…”

**A/N: Someone actually brought this up to me, and I figured I should answer it here in case anyone else has this sort of question.**

**Some of you might be thinking: Is this the end of Izuku's character arc?**

**Well, no.**

**Here's the thing. Izuku and Kyouka's overarching arcs, (Izuku's past and Kyouka's body/self-esteem) have to run their course eventually. They mostly have, with each of them mostly accepting those flaws and their pasts, and now they can really move forward from them.**

**But, these are things that will stick with them for years, if not forever. It's just a part of who they are.**

**Their character arcs will continue in different ways and evolve in future story-arcs, and new personal struggles and conflicts will emerge. The Overhaul Arc and Vigilante Arcs are the first that come to mind when it comes to big things I have plans for, especially when it comes to their characters.**

**Not to mention the current Lady Nagant Arc, which will have a good focus on Izuku's father. This arc is my very first completely original one, and will be very important to the overall world of MHA. It probably won't be as long as something like Overhaul, but to be fair, this has been building-up for a long time. Pretty much since Kaina was first mentioned a long time ago, even before the All Might chapters.**

**And, I haven't even mentioned Tomura and his continuing arc. Both he and AFO have been pretty much completely redone for AMP, and I'm excited to show you what I have planned for them.**

**...Also, shameless art promotion**
