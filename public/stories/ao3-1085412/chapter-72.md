*14* *th* *April 1995*

"*Moony,*

*The Dark Lord has granted help to your sire and contacted old associates. He wants your bride and your child as test subjects.*

*Consider this warning an early wedding present.*

*Congratulations, Wormtail."*

"I see Wormy's 'Save My Own Arse' campaign continues." Sirius tossed the note to Harry and folded his arms.

Remus nodded at him from his seat behind the wide desk in his study at Black Farm. He had offered it to Sirius but been waved back into it with a muttered 'it's yours more than mine' comment. "Gregor's pack members in the countryside have sent word that there's a coven of vampires moving in this direction."

"Voldemort probably contacted the Carrows then." Sirius stated with a scowl. "They escaped abroad and had that kinky relationship with that vampire."

"The Carrows?" asked Harry as he handed the note back to Remus.

"Alecto and Amycus." Remus stated. "Brother and sister. They were a year ahead of us at school. Vile, vile, vile people." He could almost taste his own disgust.

Harry blinked at him as though surprised at the venom but cocked an eyebrow at Sirius, silently asking for more of an explanation.

"They just like hurting people." Sirius said succinctly. "Old Man Carrow wasn't so bad. He used to work for my grandfather as an estate manager out in Croatia but he married his first cousin and their son, the Carrows' father, was always a bit odd."

"What about their mother?" asked Harry.

"Dead at childbirth." Remus said. "There was a rumour that she was actually Archibald's illegitimate half-sister because the one picture the Carrows had seemed to suggest a strong family relationship between their mother and father."

"Yikes," murmured Harry, "talk about in-breeding."

"I know," Sirius said shuddering visibly, "honestly, my own mother and father were first cousins and frankly I think it's a miracle Regulus and I came out relatively sane."

Remus refrained from making a joke because he knew exactly how sensitive Sirius was about the topic. He saw Harry restrain himself too, a bitten lip giving away that he had been going to say something before thinking better of it.

"Anyway," Remus hurried on, "the Carrows are twins…"

"Especially close twins." Sirius commented dryly. "If Mum and Dad were brother and sister then perhaps it explains why they ended up shagging each other too."

"Ew!" Harry wrinkled his nose.

"They were found in flagrante delicto in one of the potions lab in our fourth year." Remus commented.

"Well, nobody else was going to sleep with them." Sirius pointed out. "Both of them look like the back end of a horse who's just had an accident."

"SIRIUS!" Remus protested as Harry turned slightly green.

"Look, we're getting side-tracked." Sirius said defensively. "The reason they're vile is that they like hurting people." He grimaced. "They caught Wormtail alone once, cursed him and made him pee his pants. The Marauders retaliated and after that they kept away from us and our friends. But, they were the prime suspects in a brutal assault on a first year muggleborn witch at the end of their final year only nothing could be proven."

Remus remembered that incident all too well. He'd been recovering in the infirmary from a full moon when the poor girl had been brought in. She'd been left a mess of broken bones, bruises, cuts and welts. He didn't know if it was a blessing that the Ministry Aurors who had been called, had decided that she was to be obliviated of the trauma.

"The Carrows were nominally in charge of the group of Death Eaters I was sent to infiltrate on the Continent." Sirius continued. "Voldemort effectively gave them control of his fight outside of Britain." He shook his head. "They allied with one of the vampire clans…"

"Although it wasn't known until after the war that they'd entered a marriage with one." Remus broke in.

Sirius flashed him an annoyed look at being interrupted. "They fed the vampires with muggles, muggleborn and enemies of Voldemort, in return the vampires helped them terrorise the local populations and so kept funding and resources, especially new recruits, funnelling to the Death Eaters."

"Sirius's undercover work actually helped close down a lot of the routes out of the Continent which drove the other side bonkers for a time." Remus glanced back at Sirius. "I'm surprised the Carrows weren't part of the group torturing you."

"We don't know that they weren't since I don't remember anything." Sirius said grimly. "Just because the family magic must have ripped to pieces who was with me when I was rescued doesn't mean the Carrows hadn't had their turn and just stepped out."

"Well, that's a lovely thought." Remus sighed heavily and leaned back in the sumptuous leather chair. If it was true then the Carrows would be looking to hurt Sirius along with grabbing Dora and his unborn child.

Harry flung himself into the visitor's chair on the other side of the desk, sprawling with ease over the comfortable seat (Remus refused to have chairs that belittled his guests in any way). "So, we think Voldemort reached out to the Carrows to help Greyback crash the wedding and they're bringing along a bunch of vampires."

"Good summary." Sirius said leaning over and ruffling Harry's hair.

"We need to step up security then." Harry said, fidgeting with the edge of his sweater.

"I've already discussed it with the Bulgarian security team." Remus said. "They're in charge since the wedding will be at the Ministerial Residence and…"

"Since when? Did Bogdan just take over the wedding arrangements?" Sirius complained, with enough irritation that Remus knew he wasn't joking.

"Sorry, Padfoot," Remus said apologetically, "I thought I'd told you. And Bogdan hasn't taken over the arrangements – his wife on the other hand…" his tone turned exasperated because he was sure the wedding would not have spiralled out of control if it hadn't been for Hilde. She was lovely but a force of nature.

Harry chuckled.

Sirius's ire melted away in the face of Harry's amusement. "Sorry, Moony, it's your wedding and you can have it anywhere you wish."

"I wish." Remus winced at how blunt he'd been – Harry's eyes had widened and Sirius had raised both his eyebrows. "It's just…if I had my way we'd have been married weeks ago in a town hall somewhere back in England with just the family in attendance."

Remus rubbed his brow tiredly. His feelings for Dora had truly deepened and he was optimistic that they could make a real go of it. They'd spent a lot of time together and while he'd admired Dora's irrepressible spirit and non-judgemental spirit before, now he was truly fond of Dora for those same qualities. They'd certainly helped her settle in with the pack. There were moments though he found her stubbornness was not the least bit endearing. And the thing she had become most stubborn about was the wedding which had grown into an event Remus still found baffling.

Remus cleared his throat as he realised Harry and Sirius were still looking at him. "I won't deny Dora the wedding she wants but frankly I'll be pleased when it's all over."

Sirius nodded slowly. "James said the same thing and his wedding to Lily was a much smaller affair."

"Hermione's thinking about eloping." Harry said sympathetically.

"Now?" teased Sirius, laughter bubbling under the single word and mischief lighting up his face. "You're a little young, aren't you?"

Harry playfully punched his arm even as he turned red. "You know what I mean!" He rolled his eyes expressively before turning back to Remus. "She said that if getting married meant wasting so much time thinking about materials and dress designs she really didn't want any part of it."

"Hermione was slightly upset at not having time to visit the Louvre." Sirius explained in a side-whisper.

"She'll probably change her mind." Remus said philosophically. "Dora seemed happy with the idea of a small wedding here at the Farm until…" he gestured in lieu of an unnecessary explanation.

"And I'm afraid you definitely don't get to elope, Snitch." Sirius added.

Harry snorted and grinned. "Do you really think you'd be able to stop Hermione if she put her mind to it?"

Sirius opened his mouth and snapped it shut again.

Remus found his own lips twitching into a smile. "I'll put a hundred galleons on her coming up with a water-tight plan, Pads."

Harry took pity on his father. "Don't worry about it, Padfoot. I'm not planning on getting married for years."

"Good to hear." Sirius said, wiping his brow in pretend relief. "I'm too young to be the Father of the Groom just yet."

Merlin, Remus thought half-panicking, he was going to be a Father of the Groom himself one day. His son was going to grow up into a man and get married and have children and Remus would be a grandfather!

"Remus?" Sirius leaned over the desk and clicked his fingers in front of Remus's face.

Remus batted him away. "I'm going to be a father."

Harry and Sirius looked at each other and looked back at him.

"And?" prompted Sirius.

"I'm going to be a father!" Remus stated again louder. "I'm going to be a Father of the Groom some day!"

Sirius started laughing.

"It's not funny!" Remus spluttered.

"It's a little funny." Harry said, amusement evident in his twinkling green eyes. "But if it makes you feel better Sirius will be a Father of the Groom way before you have to worry about it."

Remus huffed out a laugh as Sirius stopped his chuckling abruptly to mock-glare at his son. "Thank you, Pronglet."

Harry waved away the gratitude. "Anyway," he said seriously, "security. Are we set or do we need to put something else in place?"

"The Residence is heavily warded and there'll be an international team of Aurors given we're hosting five different Ministers." Remus shook his head. He still didn't believe who he'd ended up having to invite. "The packs are organising some kind of patrol on the outskirts as it's mostly surrounded by woodland. We've been offered rooms the night before and after."

"We'll keep the Black residences for sleeping." Sirius stated firmly.

Remus nodded. "I've already informed Bogdan that was going to be the likely decision."

"We'll tell everyone who's coming of the possible threat." Sirius concluded. "Everyone needs to be aware." He frowned. "If Dora is a specific target then we'll give her an emergency portkey." He pointed at Harry. "You'll get one too; no argument."

Harry raised his hands in surrender.

"Emergency portkeys all round." Remus agreed. "I'm sure Bogdan will agree." He kept his gaze locked with Sirius. "However, I will fight Greyback if he makes an appearance."

Sirius darted a look at Harry and Remus knew his old friend would have preferred to have discussed it without Harry in the room. But Sirius had been acknowledging Harry had a role to play in their plan against Voldemort since the turn of the year and Remus figured he would allow Harry to stay.

"It's an Alpha thing, right?" Harry surmised quickly.

"That's right." Remus said. "If I retreat, it's the same as showing my throat to him."

Sirius finally sat down in the second visitor's chair. "I don't claim to understand the pack dynamics, Moony, but as Padfoot I understand some of the instincts, so I won't argue."

"Thank you." Remus said.

"I can't believe they'll crash the wedding." Harry complained.

"The date and the location were in the press." Sirius shrugged. "All Greyback has to do is get his hands on an invitation and he has the exact details."

"Dora swears that all the ones she sent out simply had the holding details on them." Remus said. "The ones which were sent with the party favours and the exact details were all sent via Gringotts."

"It doesn't mean we should assume that they don't have the details." Sirius mused. He quirked his eyebrows at Remus. "We'll let the invitations stand but…change things around a little."

And oh that was Sirius's Marauder grin.

Remus couldn't help but be amused, nostalgic wistfulness filling him to the brim at all the other times he'd seen that particular look on Sirius's face. "Everyone stays clothed."

Sirius clasped his hands to his heart but his eyes were smiling. "You wound me, Mister Moony."

"You mean I *know* you, Mister Padfoot." Remus tilted his head. "You're thinking of laying an ambush."

"They think they know where we'll be and when…" Sirius grinned widely. "We use that to our advantage."

Harry smirked. "Right. They think we're trapped but instead we trap them."

"It could work." Remus mused out loud. "We would have to change everything around about the wedding day and – oh Merlin Dora is going to kill me."

"I'll handle your bride." Sirius offered with a 'you're such a wimp' look.

"And Andy?" Remus pressed.

Sirius's eyes flickered with a note of worry but he nodded.

"And Hilde?" Remus added.

Finally Sirius flinched but he covered quickly and waved his hands. "It'll be fine." He brightened. "I'll get Narcissa to do it."

Harry started laughing.

Remus pointed at him. "We could assign you to the task instead, Snitch."

"Oh no way!" Harry said, still laughing. "Padfoot has a thing about putting myself into dangerous situations."

Sirius sniffed. "And quite right too."

He and Harry grinned at each other. Remus felt his heart turn over in his chest at the easy loving relationship the two shared. It had been more than he had dared hoped for that first night when Harry had broken down sobbing just at the thought he was wanted.

"Speaking of being a responsible parent," Sirius said with a touch more seriousness, "you should head up to bed, Pronglet. You've got an early start tomorrow to see the Quidditch stadium."

Harry stuck his tongue out but gave way, getting out of the chair. He glomped Sirius with an in-chair hug before he grinned at Remus and waved a goodnight.

Remus waited until the door was closed. "The pack loved him." He commented with a shake of his head because he'd been worried and it had all been for nothing. The pack had taken to Harry like a wolf to the full moon. His easy acceptance of them, the way he cared…it made him easy to like.

"He's very lovable." Sirius confirmed with a paternal smile.

"He looks well." Harry was tanned, fit and bubbling with energy. It was a good look on the teenager.

"We've had a few days just being regular tourists and holidaying." Sirius explained. "No tournament, no strategizing or tactics, nothing about school even…just fun. It's done him the world of good."

"And you." Remus commented, taking note that Sirius also looked well rested and relaxed.

Sirius nodded. "I won't argue with you there."

Guilt filled Remus again. His poor choices had left Sirius alone to deal with everything. Sirius had spent the second task by himself, he'd had to deal with the Lumiere situation without Remus, and the whole Death's Champion notion…Remus still had to get his head around that.

"I should be with you and Harry." Remus murmured remorsefully.

Sirius rolled his grey eyes. "You should be with your soon-to-be-wife and your unborn child." He contradicted Remus gruffly. "Let's not do this again."

"When we met for that first time back in Black Manor after I left Hogwarts, I said I wouldn't walk away again." Remus argued. "This feels like walking away."

"Look," Sirius leaned forward, his eyes intent on Remus, "you have other obligations now than our original plan to make sure Harry grows up and has the opportunity to elope with Hermione and have a lot of grandchildren none of whom will be called Quaffle."

He raised a hand when Remus opened his mouth to argue.

"Here's the thing, Moony: the original plan? That was you and me, and Harry to a very small degree, and yes, we were holding the government accountable and forcing them to do their jobs, but it was us on our own." He held Remus's gaze. "But we're not alone. We have allies and friends and family now. And it's not just our plan anymore it's Harry's own plan. And you haven't walked away, you're still here for us. We both know it."

Remus nodded his head slowly, acknowledging Sirius's point. It didn't stop the guilt from curdling in his gut though.

"I wish you didn't have to fight Greyback." Sirius said abruptly changing the subject.

"It was always going to happen, Padfoot." Remus replied. He lifted a hand. "Pack politics aside, he and I were destined to fight as soon as he signed back on with Voldemort." It was his turn to hold Sirius's gaze. "I won't let him harm Harry."

Sirius gave a huff and settled back. "It sounds like Dora and your kid have become a target too."

"I'm beginning to realise how Prongs felt." Remus admitted, and paused as something occurred to him for the first time. "How you feel."

Sirius waved away Remus's observation.

"You're a good father, Padfoot." Remus said without a hint of teasing. "Harry's come into his own with you as his parent. I hope I do half as well with my child."

"You'll be brilliant." Sirius said, but Remus could see from the glint in his eye that Sirius had been touched by the praise.

Remus decided to be kind and changed the topic. "Have I told you lately that I'm glad I have an assistant now?" He picked up a piece of parchment. "Wenlock wasn't a bad estate manager. Five properties; two in Switzerland, two in England, and one in Spain. The first property in Switzerland was gifted to Lady Wenlock as per your agreement. The second property is a farm which is turning a good profit." He cleared his throat. "The English properties have been assessed; the house in London is in good repair as it was the primary domicile when they were in England. The cottage down in Dorset is frankly in need of refurbishment but it does bring in good revenue from rental to muggle tourists. The Spanish property is out in the wilds and in ruins by all accounts."

"We're holding the vaults under the Wenlock name, correct?" Sirius asked idly.

"We are." Remus sighed. "You could by rights take the money and properties for the House of Potter."

Sirius shrugged. "Wenlock's kids don't need to lose their inheritance because he's an arrogant tosser."

"What are you going to have Christopher do in service?" Remus asked.

"I've sent him a letter saying I'll talk with him after his graduation. I want to see what he wants to do and then whether we have an opportunity for him to do that within service." Sirius sighed. "I also need to talk with his brother and sister. They and their mother are all under our House protection now."

And Sirius took that seriously, Remus knew that.

"Harry's already sent them a couple of letters." Sirius added, surprising Remus into looking at him.

"He has?"

"Said if they were going to be members of his House he wanted to get to know them so he wrote to them suggesting they all set aside Lord Wenlock's behaviour and move forward from this point." Sirius shrugged. "He and Christopher have had a couple of lunches together too."

"And they've responded positively?" checked Remus, taken aback more than he wanted to show to Sirius.

"Alex wrote back quite formally, but according to Viktor, the news from Durmstrang is that the letter helped the boy enormously; it's given him some protection after his father's shocking demise." Sirius recounted. "Anne, on the other hand, is delighted to have the Boy Who Lived sending her mail and I'm fairly certain has now chastised Christopher for not offering her in marriage when the surrender became known."

Remus started chuckling. "Poor Harry."

"She's young. Christopher's a good kid." Sirius said. "Good head on his shoulders which is why I'd like to offer him a service in line with his aspirations if we can."

"Are you regretting the lifetime of service requirement you made of him?" asked Remus. Lifetime services were rare as they kept someone tied to their oath all of their lives.

"Yes, in that I don't think I truly needed to have insisted on it to keep him from considering coming after Harry for revenge," Sirius said after a moment's thought, "and no, since the only way to be sure of his loyalty right now is the lifetime of service."

"And you don't think Alex and Anne would take revenge if their brother doesn't?" Remus asked.

"Christopher is the one who lost the most." Sirius said. "He's the one who should have inherited on his father's death. But now he's lost access to the magic, to the money, to his properties, to his inheritance and legacy. The others lost out on access to those same things but they weren't due to inherit anything but an appropriate bequest. Their loss isn't the same." He shifted in the seat. "Having spoken with him, I know he blames his father for the situation, but…his mother definitely blames Harry and me."

And suddenly Remus got it. "The service protects him from complying with his mother's demands." He said out loud. "He can legitimately refuse any plans for revenge she comes up with because of the risk to his magic."

"Exactly." Sirius said. "Harry and I are agreed. We'll discuss it with Christopher but we're going to put the bulk of the Wenlock estate into trust, which we'll manage on his behalf or he can manage himself, for his children to be given as payment on completion of his service."

Or in other words, death.

But it was an elegant solution. Ultimately the Wenlock family kept their inheritance despite Simon Wenlock's best efforts to cock things up for his children. Harry and Sirius were good men, Remus considered proudly; most others would simply have added the wealth to their own and ignored the injustice to Wenlock's children.

"I'll talk to Brian about getting that set-up." Remus said, making a note. "What about Bill? He's almost completed his service now."

Sirius nodded. "Came to see me the other day to talk about that." He smiled. "He wants to get his family seat back."

Remus's eyebrows rose. "That's going to take some doing."

"He's half-way there." Sirius argued. "Arthur's in a good position but he could never win a family seat because of his past history."

Which Remus thought was a shame since if there was one thing Arthur was it was an honourable man.

"Bill's made a good impression on the alliance Heads and Heirs." Sirius noted. "He just needs to start building relationships and alliances for the Weasleys. We can help as part of our alliance of friendship."

"He's also going to need money if he's going to be considered seriously." Remus pointed out.

"He knows that." Sirius said. "He feels duty bound to go back and finish up his contract with Gringotts and I don't think that's a bad move. He'll make a good salary as a cursebreaker and, once he's in a senior position, he'll get a proportion of the gold." He shrugged. "If he makes a good marriage, makes the right connections, continues to be himself, I think he has a good chance of winning a vote if the Weasleys get nominated in the future."

Clearly Sirius would help him, and Remus couldn't imagine a Wizengamot which included Sirius and Harry where the Weasleys wouldn't win a vote.

"As far as the other services are concerned," Sirius continued, "both of them have years before they graduate yet."

"I'm assuming you want Alex Wenlock in service for the same reason as Christopher?" Remus leaned back again, regarding Sirius with a frown.

"And you're wondering why a year not life like Christopher?" Sirius pointed a finger at him. "I don't want it to look like we entrapped the entire family. Alex can spend a year in service training for whatever he wants. He leaves us happy and knowing his brother is still in service and somewhat at our mercy should hopefully curtail any revenge notions."

It wasn't a bad strategy.

"Which leaves Theodore Nott." Remus murmured.

"Theo's a politician through and through. He reminds me of my grandfather." Sirius commented wryly. "I figure we'll make him the Ministry liaison for his service year." He shrugged. "We have a few years yet to think about it."

"Speaking of your grandfather," Remus's mouth went dry as he remembered what he'd needed to talk to Sirius about for weeks but hadn't quite gotten the courage to do it, "there's a portrait."

Sirius stared at him. "What?"

"It was buried in the back of the main vault." Remus said quietly. "It was noted as part of the inventory only as a family portrait. Penny did a complete listing for me and…well, it's there. He's asleep."

Sirius shook himself in a Padfoot-like fashion. "He can stay there then."

"Padfoot…"

"Don't." Sirius ordered brusquely. He yawned suddenly, spoiling the effect of a stern Lord, and pulling a reluctant smile from Remus.

"Maybe Harry's not the only one needing an early night." Remus commented.

Sirius shot him a look but deflated a second later when another yawn caught him off-guard. "Time differences are a pain the arse." He said defensively. He got to his feet though. "I'll see you in the morning."

"See you in the morning." Remus said quietly.

He waited until Sirius had left before he turned his attention back to his over-flowing desk. He shoved most of the parchment to the side and drew a blank sheet towards him. He'd always been the planner of the Marauders and he had a wedding ambush to set.

He smiled wickedly.

Greyback wasn't going to know what hit him.

o-O-o

*15* *th* *April 1995*

"This is incredible!" Harry slipped his hand back into Hermione's and grinned at Viktor. "You play here a lot?"

The wide expanse of grass, the cushioning spells making it slightly bouncy under their feet, spread out in every direction. They paused by the first set of hoops. They were higher than the ones at Hogwarts – professionals played at a greater height than the school leagues.

"International team, yes." Viktor said. "Durmstrang has own pitch and team stadium is in North."

"How do you combine school and your commitments to the team sport?" Hermione asked, her eyes alight with curiosity.

Viktor ran a hand through his dark hair. "It not so difficult. School agrees to release for practice. I practice at school. Games are at veekend."

Harry nodded thoughtfully. He looked back over to where Sirius and Simeon were talking with the Bulgarian Head Coach, Remus acting as translator. The Delacours stood beside them on one side, and Leonard Abbott with Stephen Warren on the other. Satisfied that the adults were all relaxed, Harry turned back and smiled.

Viktor's eyes were pinned to Natalie Warren. She stood by the next hoop with Cedric and Fleur, hands gesturing enthusiastically as the two girls laughed at something and Cedric ducked his head.

"Maybe we should go rescue Cedric." Harry suggested wryly.

Hermione gave a light chuckle as Viktor immediately started over towards them. She leaned into Harry's space. "He's so head over heels about her."

And Viktor was. Head over heels and wrapped around her little finger. Thankfully Natalie seemed completely smitten too.

They followed Viktor across the grass and Harry took a moment to breathe in the scent; there was a faint hint of rain.

The tour of the stadium was something that he'd really been looking forward to and he was pleased that Viktor had opened it up to the other Champions and their guests. Harry had immediately asked his best friends. Augusta had apologised but it was Neville's Uncle Algie's birthday and they had a party they needed to attend in England. Hermione's parents had agreed as they were already going to be in Bulgaria for the wedding, but Molly had refused to let Ron attend despite Sirius's offer to have Bill present. She had claimed she wanted her younger children home for the Easter break since Arthur and Bill would be abroad to attend the wedding. In truth, Harry knew it was partially financial; even with Arthur's promotion, money was tight in the Weasley household and they had eschewed Sirius offering to cover the travel for all of the Weasley family to come to Bulgaria.

"It's a shame Molly wouldn't let Ron come." Hermione commented as though she'd read Harry's mind.

"I think his only solace is that Draco isn't here either." Harry agreed. He had invited Draco but Narcissa had scheduled final fittings for the Malfoys' wedding outfits in Paris so he had also missed out. Harry's face brightened. "At least Ron can celebrate Gryffindor winning the Quidditch Cup."

Hermione rolled her eyes. "Don't you mean continue celebrating? Honestly, I didn't think the team were ever going to go to bed."

"They did good." Harry said firmly, trying to be upbeat.

Angelina had been a great Captain; Ron and the twins made an unbeatable defence once Ron had settled in, with the Chaser girls in good form, and Ginny performing well as Seeker, the team had had a good season without him.

"You'll get back on the team next year." Hermione said briskly, soothing his unspoken worry that perhaps he had lost his place. "Ginny really wants to be a Chaser."

"Maybe." Harry hoped so but truthfully the next academic year seemed so far in the future that he couldn't envisage it especially when he knew he still had to survive the third task and Voldemort's ritual plans for him.

"What are you two talking about?" asked Cedric as they approached. There was a hint of desperation in his voice which told Harry that Fleur and Natalie had been talking about something girly again.

"Quidditch." Harry grinned at him. "Gryffindor's win, specifically."

Cedric's relief brightened his face despite the gloating smugness that Harry was letting paint his. "Laugh it up now, Potter." He teased. "We'll see who wins next year when I'm back on the team."

"Kennington wasn't half as good as you," Harry acknowledged, "and Ginny had her beat hands down." In fact the only Seeker Ginny had struggled with was Draco, and even then she had almost gotten to the Snitch.

Hermione huffed out a breath. "Honestly."

"We're in a Quidditch stadium," Harry pointed out with a wide smile, "you can't expect us to talk about anything else."

"I guess not." Hermione acknowledged, squeezing his hand a touch to let him know she didn't mind.

"This is great." Cedric said. "It really gives you a feel for how much bigger everything is at the professional level. I'm glad Lord Abbott was able to bring me."

"How's your Dad doing?" asked Harry, genuinely interested. He didn't particularly like Cedric's Dad after all the nastiness in the press (even if he understood some of it had been at Wenlock's instigation and acerbated by the suggestion potions) but he wouldn't have wished for what had happened to the bloke.

"Better but he's not up to travelling." Cedric said. "They're giving him a medical retirement." He sighed. "It's hit him hard."

Harry winced but stayed quiet unsure what to say.

"Hannah and Susan didn't come?" asked Hermione delicately.

Cedric shook his head. "They didn't get permission from the parents." He said chagrined. "I wanted to use the trip to make it up to Sue as well but…" he sighed and stuck his hands in his pockets. "I guess I should let it lie really. Sue's barely spoken to me since the second task."

"I think she does like you." Hermione offered.

"Susan?" checked Natalie, dragging Viktor and Fleur over to talk with them. "She's crazy about you, Diggory."

"I'm not sure." Cedric demurred.

"So, ask her out and find out for certain." Natalie said briskly.

"She ees right." Fleur argued passionately. "You must fight for 'er if you love 'er. I weel never give up on my Beel."

Cedric held his hands up in mock surrender. "Just…can we go back to talking about Quidditch?" He turned to Viktor. "This is a great pitch."

Viktor nodded. "It is vell maintained by the grounds-elf."

"An elf?" asked Hermione tersely.

Harry jumped in before a debate could start up. He shuddered dramatically. "I can't believe they're going to build a maze on the one at Hogwarts."

Viktor grimaced. "It is a disgrace."

Cedric nodded. "Where are we supposed to practice?"

"Exactly." Harry pointed at him.

"It could be worse," Hermione said, "they might have decided to use the Forbidden Forest for the third task. A maze isn't so bad."

"The Forbidden…" Cedric stared at her. "You have to be kidding me!"

"Non," Fleur said, flicking her long hair back, "'Ermione ees correct. Ze Forest was used once."

"It's not the maze part that worries me," Cedric admitted, "it's what going into the maze. I mean, we had dragons for the first task and there was that lake monster in the second which was supposed to be the obstacle for a single Champion making a run for it on their own!"

Harry nodded.

Fleur sighed. "Eet is a worry."

Viktor shrugged. "Training is most important."

Harry kept quiet. While he knew Voldemort had futzed with the tasks, the other three had all volunteered for the tournament, and a tiny unsympathetic part of him believed they had only themselves to blame for the consequences. Of course, Voldemort was making the tasks more difficult and Harry did feel some guilt about *that*.

Natalie wrapped one arm around one of Viktor's. "I just hope you all come out of it in one piece."

"We will." Harry said confidently.

"You might." Cedric said dryly. "Some of us just don't have your luck."

Harry stiffened. He didn't see what was so lucky about getting entered into the tournament and being pursued by a sociopathic Dark Lord. Hermione squeezed his hand gently and he turned to smile at her, grateful for the support.

"Ve need to make our own luck." Viktor said firmly. "Practice, practice, practice. Just like on Quidditch pitch."

They all nodded.

Viktor gestured back up the pitch. "Ve should return vor the votos."

Harry pulled a face but it was good publicity and while he'd never enjoy doing it, he understood the value of it, understood he needed it to keep public opinion on his side to help progress his political agenda.

They started walking. Viktor, Fleur and Natalie led the way, and Cedric joined Hermione and Harry at the rear.

"They're talking about wedding outfits again." Cedric said in a stage whisper.

Harry's lips twitched as Hermione's eyes widened in alarm. He gave her a nudge and grinned. "How long did you have to spend getting your dress?"

"Two whole days." Hermione complained huffily. "First the material wasn't right, then the colour, then there was a big deal about the shoes not being right so they were going to change the whole outfit until I told them we'd just change the shoes!"

Cedric started laughing. "You didn't enjoy it then? I thought most girls liked the whole dressing up thing."

Hermione sniffed. "I don't mind dressing up nicely, I just don't see why it took two days to pull together an outfit. There was nothing wrong with the first dress but Andy didn't like it and Tonks didn't like the second and…I would have been happy with either."

Harry knew she was mostly annoyed that it had cut down on the amount of time she'd had to go sight-seeing.

Cedric shook himself. "I take it you're in dress robes, Harry?"

"Sirius sorted it all out with Remus." Harry confirmed, thankful his father had stepped in when Andy had tried to argue about the choice of outfit being unsuitable and trying to change it. "We've been set for a while."

"I meant to thank you for the invite. Dad said it was up to me whether I should attend or not, but I know he's not comfortable with the idea of me being around so many werewolves." Cedric explained. "His younger brother was killed by one and I think if I attended the wedding he'd be so stressed worrying about me, it would put his recovery back."

"I can understand that." Harry said. "The pack we have at the sanctuary is pretty great but with your Dad's history I can appreciate he wouldn't want you spending time with them."

"Viktor mentioned there were rumours of a vampire clan on the move too?" Cedric said. "Although you should be fine if you're with a pack. Usually vampires stay away from werewolves."

"Why?" asked Hermione, her eyes bright with curiosity.

"There's an ancient tale that werewolves can rip a vampire apart." Cedric explained. "But that's never been substantiated."

"Really? All the books I've read suggested the avoidance was mostly territorial as they're pretty equally matched in strength." Harry interjected.

"I've read the same." Hermione said briskly.

"But there's so much misinformation about dark creatures around, how do we know for certain?" Cedric argued cheerfully. "One old book I read claimed vampires had sparkly skin and that's why they avoided daylight, and everybody knows that's just wrong."

"Really?" Hermione shook head in disbelief. "Sparkly vampires? Are you sure the book wasn't fiction?"

They were all laughing as they caught up with the others and headed in for the press conference.

o-O-o

Neville tugged on Blaise's arm and they slowly stepped back until they were clear of the drawing room. Neville winced as he caught his Gran's eagle eye but she gave him a nod and there was a clear shooing motion communicated with a wave of a hand that went unnoticed by the bevy of old family members around her.

He sighed with relief as he led Blaise through the less formal areas of Longbottom Manor and out to the garden. They took refuge in Neville's favourite greenhouse filled with bright leafy green plants and colourful flowers blooming in pots on every surface. Blaise wrinkled his nose at the thin layer of dirt on the edges of the benches and the floor but Neville ignored him and nudged him through to a small orangey at the back.

It had an ever-warm spell and with a sitting area of a couple of wicker chairs and matching table, it was one of Neville's hiding places.

"Sorry you got dragged into Uncle Algie's party." Neville said as he slid into one of the wicker chairs.

Blaise gave a shrug, his eyes gleaming with amusement. "Serves me right for landing myself on you with no warning."

More accurately it was Nora Zabini's fault, Neville thought with a touch of righteous anger for the way she treated Blaise. She'd stopped by the manor that morning with Blaise, had been appropriately flustered and apologetic, and had requested Augusta look after Blaise until they met up at the wedding in Bulgaria due to Nora suddenly needing to be abroad to deal with some business.

Blaise had confessed in the wake of Nora's departure that his mother had received word from a friend of a friend that the wedding dress had been commissioned in Paris and suddenly nothing else would do for Nora's own outfit for the day.

Neville thought Blaise's mother was a selfish, self-absorbed narcissist but it would be impolite to say so to Blaise himself. But despite the reason for Blaise being there, Neville was pleased to host his friend, not least because it got him out of the party for his Great-Uncle.

"Thanks for playing distraction." Neville said and smiled at the elf who popped in with cake and juice for them.

"I think they'd have preferred Potter." Blaise said dryly.

Neville shrugged. It was a disappointment to the older set that Harry had been unable to attend. "If Harry was here we'd have ended up with him duelling my Great-Aunt Bessie."

She had been very scathing about Tonks and the upcoming wedding.

"You have to admit politically they're walking a fine line accepting her marriage to a werewolf, even if he is the steward, and there's the baby." Blaise pointed out. "They've been extraordinarily lucky with the press making this whole thing out to be a society event rather than a scandal. They have to have something on Skeeter."

Neville made a non-committal noise and offered Blaise some cake.

"I'm not a Gryff. I'm not easily distracted with food." Blaise said as he accepted the slice with a grin.

"Just with intrigue." Neville joked back. He dug into his own slice of the raspberry ripple and fudge creation with enthusiasm. He might not agree with his uncle on everything but the man had taste in cakes.

"So I'm going with they do have something on Skeeter." Blaise concluded as he scooped up a sugar encrusted raspberry.

"Maybe you're right. I don't know for sure." Neville licked his fork and was immediately guiltily, his inner Gran remonstrating with him about table manners. "I think everyone in the alliance is very aware that we're damned lucky that they had the means to spin this the way we needed it to be spun."

"Agreed." Blaise said. "Lupin did send along a nice apology with the details of the invitation and the favour. Mother loved the brooch."

"I assume you got a tie-pin with your name engraved?" Neville asked, curious if the gifts had been the same. His Gran had been over the moon about the small bear brooch Remus had sent them.

Blaise nodded. "Charmed too?"

Neville nodded. "It'll deflect one level three hex."

"Very nice favours." Blaise shook his head. "It must have cleared out their vaults unless the House of Black gave them the cash." He lifted an inquiring eyebrow.

"Don't be crass." Neville admonished. But his Gran had commented the same, although she had also noted that Remus had received a good inheritance from the Potters.

"I did think that the warning about the expected imminent attack by Greyback and some vamps might put my mother off attending but…no." Blaise sighed.

"Must be a difficult position for a Slyth." Neville commented, amused. "Self-preservation tells you to stay away but the fact that it is going to be a major society event of the year that you have to be seen at…" he let his sentence trail away gleefully.

Blaise waved his fork at him but his eyes were twinkling. "Laugh it up. At least we have some self-preservation skills unlike you Gryffs."

"Hey," Neville said cheerfully, "I resemble that remark!"

They both laughed.

"I'm sure we'll be well protected." Neville returned to the subject as they settled back to finishing their cake. "Harry and Sirius won't let anything happen to anyone."

Blaise nodded. "It wouldn't surprise me if we got there and found things aren't quite as planned as we've been told."

Neville nodded in agreement. Harry had sent word to the Heirs that with the known threat he wanted everyone on the guard at the wedding. "I won't argue with you."

"So I can't tempt you to place a galleon on it?" teased Blaise, pushing his plate away.

"Not this time." Neville said. "Are you taking bets on the baby?"

"Boy or girl and the birthday." Blaise replied instantly. "You interested?"

They negotiated available dates and Neville placed his galleon satisfied his inside knowledge that Tonks had already been pregnant before the couple had left for the sanctuary made his date the more likely to happen.

Blaise regarded Neville thoughtfully. "I'm surprised Hannah wasn't invited to keep you company and meet the extended family."

Neville grimaced. "She was invited but Sue's been a bit of a mess since the whole second task and fallout over Cedric and Cho so…"

"So she's doing the girly thing with Bones." Blaise gave a sympathetic grimace of his own. "Tough luck."

Neville had been slightly irked by Hannah's insistence that Susan came first, despite the fact that Hannah had accepted the invitation when it had first been raised. In fact they'd had their first real argument about it. They hadn't broken up – or at least Neville didn't think they had – but they had yelled at each other a bit. Neville had argued that she'd made a commitment to attend and she was letting him down; she'd argued that her friendship with Susan and helping her through her troubles took priority over a 'poxy party for a relative you don't even like.'

Blaise clucked his tongue suddenly. "I'm guessing from the look on your face things aren't so sunny in Neville and Hannah-land anymore?"

Neville shot him a quick 'back-off' look and Blaise raised his hands.

"Just…if you want to talk about it…" Blaise shrugged again as though it wasn't important to him. But Neville appreciated the thought and the offer.

He shifted position a touch as he tried to consider how to phrase things. He eventually sighed. "We had a row."

"Ah." Blaise said.

"It's, well, stupid really but ever since the second task it feels like every date Hannah and I have is interrupted or cut short or cancelled because of Sue and what's going on with her. I didn't mind at the beginning because it was really bad with the letters and Cho glaring at her all the time but it's been months since the second task and she shouldn't need her hand holding every minute of the day anymore." Neville complained bluntly, feeling a little better having gotten it off his chest. Hermione had listened to him complain a little before the end of term but he hadn't wanted to fully unload on her, too aware that she had formed a close friendship with Sue over the second task.

"And you told Hannah that reneging on the party was the last straw." Blaise surmised.

"To which I got a lecture that I wasn't a girl and didn't understand how utterly humiliating being chosen had been for Sue and as I wasn't a Hufflepuff obviously I don't understand the concept of loyalty and friendship which is complete bollocks." Neville said heatedly.

Blaise grinned at him and Neville chuckled ruefully as he considered how stupid the argument had been.

"Sounds like you have a point." Blaise said, sitting back in his chair and picking up his juice. "I don't have a regular girlfriend but it'd annoy me if she kept breaking all our dates to keep checking on her best friend."

"Thank you!" said Neville grateful that Blaise agreed with him. He sighed and rubbed his nose. "I guess Hannah had a point too. I mean, I don't know how it works with girls and maybe my thinking Sue should just get over it is a tad insensitive."

Blaise gave a half-shrug. "Well, I find women just as bizarre as you do because I think you're right and she should get over it already. Sure, the letter thing was nasty but it's not like anyone thinks Sue intentionally stole Cedric away from Cho except Cho and her cronies."

Neville's gaze sharpened on him speculatively. "But?"

"But," Blaise said raising his glass, "if living with my mother has taught me one thing, it has taught me that in any argument the man is always in the wrong even when he's in the right."

"You're not wrong." Neville murmured. He had never seen his Gran admit to being wrong ever after an argument. Even when she was. Very, very wrong. "I guess it's an apology and some flowers."

"I don't know, Nev," Blaise said, a lot more tentatively than Neville had ever heard him sound, "if you concede the argument this time, Abbott's the type that'll walk all over you."

Neville bristled defensively. Hannah wasn't that bad!

Blaise sighed at Neville's glare. "I'm not saying she's not great because I actually think Hannah's cool. All I'm saying is that your point isn't invalid and you shouldn't apologise for it. The argument itself and saying Sue should get over herself, yes. The point you made about Sue encroaching on all your time together, no."

It was the kind of careful distinction that Slytherins were very good at defining and Neville nodded slowly. Because he could see that if he did back down from his main gripe, it would set a precedent.

"You're right." He said with a sigh. He considered his predicament as he sipped his drink and sighed again more heavily. If Hannah really didn't think there was anything wrong with her behaviour then they had a problem. "It was so much easier when we were practicing."

Blaise laughed but his eyes sharpened on Neville speculatively. "You're thinking you might have to break up with her to hold your ground?"

"Maybe." Neville conceded, partly admiring Blaise for reading him so well, and partly hating that he was so obvious.

"You'd be alright with that?" asked Blaise carefully.

Neville pursed his lips thoughtfully. He knew if he had been in the same position the year before, he would have just apologised for the whole thing and been incredibly unhappy as Hannah walked all over him. But he wasn't that same timid boy any longer. He said as much to Blaise. "If she can't see she's wrong then she's not right for me any way."

"Good on you." Blaise said approvingly. "And honestly I'm glad you're not the same as you were." He glanced around the Orangey. "For a start I'd probably be stuck alone at home rather than here."

Neville smiled. "We wouldn't be friends."

"No," Blaise agreed, grinning, "Potter has a lot to answer for." His grin faded away. "He still doesn't get how much power he has, does he?"

"I don't think he ever will." Neville said simply, shrugging. "Harry just doesn't think in those terms. He doesn't want power so he doesn't notice that he has it." He paused. "I think he is starting to realise how much of a leader he is though, at least, for us the alliance."

Blaise nodded slowly. "He's a genuinely good guy." He murmured as though he couldn't believe it. "It makes you wonder what he'd be like if Sirius had actually raised him."

"Hell on a broom." Neville said immediately with a smirk.

Blaise laughed again. "He's that anyway."

Neville sobered, thinking about Harry, about the prophecy. He wouldn't want to be in his godbrother's shoes but he was determined to be at his side. "He needs us."

"He has us." Blaise stated simply. He raised his glass.

Neville picked up his own and they solemnly clinked glasses as though they'd made a vow.

o-O-o

Severus ignored the bawdy wink Rosmerta ended their exchange with and instead headed over to the table of The Three Broomsticks for his latest assignation with Bartemius Crouch Junior. He wasn't surprised to find the shapely form of Crouch's red-haired feminine alias waiting for him.

"Severus!" He purred. "Wonderful to see you again." He reached for him as though to kiss him and Severus stepped around him swiftly, placing the table between them.

He refused to remove his cloak or his gloves. He was only there for one reason; to receive whatever orders the Dark Lord had sent via Crouch. He scanned the room swiftly but apart from a couple of wide-eyed Hogwarts students, the rest of the pub's clientele were politely ignoring them.

"You couldn't have found somewhere more discreet?" asked Severus, careful to keep his tone low as he cast a privacy bubble around them. "It is a Hogsmeade weekend for students who remained during the break."

"My dear Severus," Crouch said in a silky tone that turned Severus's stomach, "anyone would think you didn't want to spend time with me." He pouted before smiling at him winsomely. "Do not fret." He reached into his pocket and pulled out a piece of parchment. "We are not staying here." He picked up a scarf and after securing it around his neck in a feminine style, he picked up thin leather gloves and headed outside.

Severus followed at a sedate pace, inwardly worried at the change of venue.

"Read the parchment." Crouch advised as he halted on the corner of the street and searched for something in his purse.

"You'll forgive me if I don't jump to follow you." Severus said quietly. "The last time we met, you left me alone with some unwanted company."

Crouch just grinned at the reminder that he had tried to kill Severus with the Dementors. "I seem to recall Father made me write you an apology and you survived, didn't you?"

Severus simply stared him down.

"Oh, pish-tosh, Severus!" Crouch said, slapping his gloves lightly against Severus's chest. "Let's put that in the past. This is Father's invitation. He'd be very upset if you did not accept."

Well, that changed the hue of it, Severus thought grimly. He opened up the parchment.

"*Lord Voldemort, Heir of Slytherin, invites you to Riddle Manor."*

Severus kept his surprise off his face. Informed of the secret, he was suddenly aware of the location again. The Aurors were monitoring but with the Fidelius in place they could no longer find it despite knowing the general area.

His heart began to beat rapidly. There had been an alarm noted a few weeks before. Had the Dark Lord decided to use it as a base? Would he be there waiting for Severus? Just the thought was enough for him to strengthen his Occlumency shields in preparation.

"Ready?" asked Crouch slyly, sliding an arm around Severus's waist. "I'd hang on, lover. I'd hate to splinch you."

Severus sniffed, took a firm hold of Crouch and in the next instant felt the pull of apparition.

They landed on a careworn country lane; hedges taller than Severus himself, the grass along the roadside tall and overflowing with wild flower. He swallowed the urge to investigate and gather; there were a number of specimens that he could see would be perfect potion ingredients. The road was narrow and Severus believed only one muggle vehicle would be able to traverse it at a time. The other side of the road was dense woodland, stretching back as far as the eye could see.

"If you look ahead…" Crouch advised sounding far too amused for Severus's liking.

Severus raised his eyes and focused on the hedge in front of him. It immediately parted revealing ornate iron gates. Crouch tapped them with his wand and they opened immediately.

"Shall we?" Crouch asked before stepping through and beginning the walk to the manor house that was some distance away from the road.

The driveway was a pitted mess; the old tarmac had been worn away in places, holes appearing here and there. It made for treacherous walking. The surrounding landscape wasn't in much better condition; overgrown lawns and flowerbeds that barely boasted any flowers. The house at a distance itself looked in better repair; the roof was in good condition, the red brick work covered in green ivy. It was only as they neared it that Severus could see the occasional crack in the walls, the crumbly nature of the mortar.

Crouch avoided the front door, leading him instead around the side to a merchants' entrance. Severus ignored Crouch's intended insult and followed him through the door and into a narrow passageway which opened out into a cellar. Crouch ignored the dusty cellar with its shelves crammed with all kinds of items and products that would have made a historian drool, and went to a door on the far side.

Severus continued following him without saying a word and stepped into a world class potions laboratory.

It halted his step abruptly.

There was a second door on the right hand wall but otherwise both the right and left walls were covered ceiling to floor by cabinets filled with hundreds if not thousands of potion ingredients. The far wall had a fumigator on the ceiling to dispel dangerous fumes; the lower third had a storage cupboard filled with different cauldrons, stirrers, pipettes, and all the other necessary potions equipment a Master of the subject required. The middle of the wall were a series of shelves with almost every potions book known to the wizarding world, some rare and highly sought after. Two long benches filled the centre of the room; wooden work surfaces scrubbed clean and sanded to glossy perfection. Occasional stools were the only other furniture.

*The Dark Lord's own potions lab.*

Nothing had changed since he'd seen it before back in the first war, although he had entered a different way that time. It was truly the best lab he had ever worked in and despite his determination to kill the Dark Lord, there was a small bubble of glee deep inside of him that he was going to be working in the lab again.

"I trust you find this satisfactory?"

Crouch's question drew Severus's attention back to the wizard; he was resting back against the wall behind Severus, the glamour had been dismissed without a word and the crazy Death Eater returned to his normal appearance; dark hair, a handsome if cold visage with a cruel smile, and a lean athletic body. He wore fashionable wizarding robes, open to reveal a brown tailored suit in expensive material.

"It has always been more than satisfactory." Severus allowed, snidely letting Crouch know of his previous history with the lab and was pleased to see Crouch stiffen in response. "I assume our Lord has need of my skills?"

Crouch drew out a letter from the inside of his robes and made to hand it to Severus.

Severus raised an eyebrow. "Leave it on the bench."

Crouch stuck out his tongue but followed the instruction. He retreated back to the wall.

Severus discreetly unholstered his wand out of sight of Crouch and cast a few diagnostic spells, reassuring himself that there was no poison or compulsion charms attached to the missive. It was sealed shut with wax, the indent of the Slytherin crest of arms in the wax. He still opened it with gloved hands and drew out the single sheet of parchment.

"*My dear Severus,*

*Your continued service in the past months has been most appreciated and will, of course, be rewarded in time.*

*I have two tasks for you.*

*Firstly, I require a Restoration Potion. It is a vital part of the ritual that will restore me to my former glory and allow us to resume our war against those who threaten our agenda and values. I trust no other to make this potion. You will find the instructions and ingredients within the far left cabinet which has been keyed to your Dark Mark. You will also find a portkey that will allow you and only you direct access into the lab so you may always have access at the correct times.*

*Secondly, I have been displeased to hear how closely Dumbledore monitors the creation of the antidote to wake the elf and the Summers woman. I appreciate though that efforts to stall would raise questions and place your position as my loyal spy at risk. Therefore, continue with the antidote but ensure the Summers woman cannot speak when she awakens.*

*I look forward to seeing the results of your tasks, Severus. I will not wish you luck as I know you have no need of it."*

Severus breathed in sharply. He refolded the letter and placed it within the envelope. "Your presence is not required for the tasks the Dark Lord has given to me."

Crouch grinned, more than a hint of crazy in his smirking face. "I wouldn't want you to wander off. I believe the rest of the manor is being guarded by the Dementors who escaped the Acromantulas you fed them to."

Severus didn't bother to correct Crouch. It was better for him if Crouch believed he'd engineered his own escape from the beasts. "Then stay out of my way."

He moved over to the cabinet. He pushed the sleeve of his left arm up to reveal the mark and the cabinet clicked open. He studied the contents for a long moment, recognising that the space had been expanded substantially.

There was a standard cauldron filled with bones seeping in liquid – bones of the father, Severus realised; the base of the potion if he remembered the details from Croaker correctly. It would provide the skeleton upon which the rest of the restoration would build. The potion required the flesh and blood added fresh at the last upon the solstice as those elements needed to be living. There were other ingredients though…

He picked up three jars; the first contained black hair, the second a green eye, the third a coiled human skin. All elements to build the Dark Lord's appearance anew, Severus mused, if they were mishandled in any way the homunculus would have an inhuman appearance.

A large snake basket sat in one corner and Severus read the note attached carefully. It held a highly venomous king cobra which was spelled into a deep slumber. The snake would need to be awakened, its head immediately severed from its body added to the potion. Again, mishandling would result in a change to the formation of the body. Why would the Dark Lord want a snake added, Severus thought to himself. Croaker had mentioned something about some Egyptian potioneers believing the addition of an animal gave the homunculus its spirit and abilities. Perhaps, Severus considered, the Dark Lord was attempting to ensure his gift of parseltongue was maintained.

The rest of the potion ingredients were fairly standard herbs and animal parts that were needed mostly for stabilisation or to act as a catalyst for the magic to bond once the flesh and blood were added. He mentally ensure to look and catalogue the ingredients carefully into his memory; he could review them later with the Headmaster and Croaker.

Finally, he stood and locking the cabinet with a lazy wave of his hand. He didn't lean against the bench as he read over the instructions, taking note of the various days and times certain actions needed to occur. It was going to be a nightmare to coordinate, Severus thought tiredly.

He was aware of Crouch's sneaking approach behind him but before the other wizard could get close enough to read the text of the instructions, Severus hit him with a wandless stinging hex.

Crouch jumped back, rubbing his cheek. He glowered at Severus. "If you want to play rough, lover…"

"Please," Severus sneered, "your threats are pathetic. You believe if the Dark Lord was to find out about your curiosity you would receive just a mild stinging hex?" He sniffed. "You should be grateful I reminded you to keep your nose out of it."

Crouch draped himself across one of the benches. "I could make that potion as easily as you."

"You are undoubtedly a good potioneer," Severus agreed, "you have successfully made the enhanced Polyjuice potion the Dark Lord invented since you used it extensively during your months playing your father, and whatever guise you wear now in the day to day at Hogwarts." He was happy to see Crouch flinch at that a touch confirming that the Death Eater was at the school still. "You also managed to write convincingly about several different potions, their theoretical background and history in the fake letters as my supposed lover." He paused, allowing Crouch the moment of smug preening he could see in the other man's eyes. "You are not however a Potions Master."

Crouch started to scowl.

"Further, this potion requires a certain exactitude of timing in adding ingredients, preparation and brewing which I dare say your current alias would not allow you to keep to without evoking questions if you were to keep disappearing without notice." Severus continued, hoping Crouch would take the bait of the hook Severus was dangling.

Crouch breathed in deeply. "You have the same problem."

Severus gave a light shrug. So, Crouch had just confirmed that his alias leaving Hogwarts constantly would draw unwanted attention. More likely he was pretending to be a student than a professor then, Severus mused. It also explained why Crouch had waited for a Hogwarts weekend to meet with him.

"I am the Potions Master at Hogwarts and Albus Dumbledore believes me his spy." Severus drawled. "I am granted a lot of latitude in my…availability due to both roles."

He replaced the instructions in the cabinet. He would need to begin within a week but he wanted to double check everything with Croaker first. He pocketed the portkey surreptitiously. "I should warn you against trying the cabinet. It's warded to my Mark alone and there is a sleeping cobra within."

Crouch grimaced.

Severus raised an eyebrow. "You're not afraid of snakes, are you, Bartemius?"

"Have you been around the Dark Lord's newest familiar yet, Severus?" Crouch snapped back. He shuddered dramatically. "Their closeness is downright creepy. It's like they're one being sometimes."

"His familiars have always been close." Severus murmured. He tucked the information on the snake away knowing it would be of interest. "I am done here for the time being. We may leave."

Crouch scowled but he motioned back to the cellar entry.

"Have you any information on the wedding of the werewolf?" Crouch asked abruptly, as they made their out of the house and back around to the driveway.

Severus gave a light shrug. "Only that the Headmaster has complained that the security is in the hands of the Bulgarians." He mentally apologised to Albus in his head but this was an easy seed of disinformation to sow.

"Were you not invited?" Crouch asked, evident surprise on his face.

"The werewolf wrote to the Headmaster that he would have liked to have invited all his former colleagues but understood the safety and security of the children staying at Hogwarts was paramount and allowed the staff to make their own determination of who could attend." Severus sneered. The letter had been as sappy as the wolf himself. "Minerva was invited separately to the missive as she is considered family and the old fool was not about to miss the society wedding of the year so it falls on myself, the bumbling Sprout and a half-breed goblin to maintain order and decorum for the day."

"Interesting." Crouch said lightly.

"Hardly," Severus snorted, "the Minister and Director Bones have assigned an Auror detail for extra security in the absence of the Headmaster given the international presence of the Durmstrang and Beauxbatons students."

Hopefully that would discourage any kind of idea of invading Hogwarts, Severus mused.

"Pity." Crouch sighed. "It might have been a perfect opportunity to have some fun otherwise."

"Or drawn attention to the fact that you are still within Hogwarts' grounds." Severus pointed out. "Surely the endgame is more important than a few trivial upsets at this stage."

"Why Severus," cooed Crouch, "you are simply filled with unwanted advice, aren't you?"

Severus raised an eyebrow. "I had thought you wanted your revenge on Black more than the thrill of cheap diversions. I will say no more."

He saw Crouch flinch and knew his barb had hit home.

There was silence for a few minutes.

Crouch cleared his throat. "Did you read the article on the use of Effaret feathers to reduce addictive qualities in sleeping draughts in the last Potions Weekly?"

"Slughorn's latest?" Severus huffed. "He has only managed one successful brewing and thus can only say there was no evidence of addiction for the test animals in the scant few weeks that the potion lasted." Slughorn had published too early. "Carrigan's peer review counter was excellent."

"But you acknowledge the properties of Effaret would counter the usual addictive nature of the plants commonly used?" Crouch continued.

"Potentially but Effaret birds are rare and their colonies protected by the countries in which they are located." Severus noted. "They are not a long term or easy solution."

The debate on the Effaret birds and countering addictive qualities continued until they exited the manor and the gates closed behind them.

Severus readied himself for apparition back to Hogsmeade and froze at the touch of Crouch's hand on his arm. He looked at the hand and back at Crouch pointedly rather than make the obvious verbal threat that he was to be released or Crouch would lose the arm.

Crouch lifted the offending appendage and waved down the road. "Perhaps we can continue our discussion? The village has a decent muggle pub."

Severus stared at Crouch, keeping his shock at the invitation well-hidden.

"You may not remember," Crouch continued, "but we used to have similar debates when you stayed with Bella during your Occlumency training."

They had. Severus had recovered all of his memories and Crouch had been welcome intellectual company. Rabastan had been smart but quiet; Rodolphus more of a thug than anything else; and Bella…Bella was insanely intelligent but expressed it only through her sadistic spell-casting.

"Back then you were more interested in Rab than serving the Dark Lord," Severus said calmly, "and I was…*naïve.*"

Crouch grimaced. "Is it so surprising that apart from my discussions with Father, I feel starved of stimulating conversation?"

Given the rest of the entourage that the Order believed the Dark Lord had it was not surprising at all. The Travers' were stolid at best, Fenrir feral, and Pettigrew insipid. However, Severus was not foolish enough to believe Crouch at face value. Crouch had treated him with barely concealed disdain since their first meeting; had attempted to kill him at Yule, and evidently resented Severus for possessing the Dark Lord's favour. All of which left the invitation from Crouch very squarely in the highly suspicious category. Of course, if he was going to find out exactly what Crouch wanted he was going to have to go along with it.

"One hour." Severus stated uncompromisingly.

Crouch tipped his head, his dark eyes glittering with satisfaction. "One hour."
