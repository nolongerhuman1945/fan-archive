***...~AMP~...***

Kyouka sucked in her cheeks as she looked at the mirror. Looking at herself up and down, she nodded. "Let's do this thing."

Tonight wasn't the night for her mind's usual antics. She had a date.

A real, legitimate date with a boy she really liked.

It didn't matter what she thought about herself. She was going all out. Kyouka quickly moved around her room, arranging the make-up she was going to use, pulling jackets off of the hangars, grabbing shirts from her drawers, picking and choosing what to wear. Izuku said it wasn't fancy or anything. Which was good, because she didn't have a really nice dress on hand. After a few minutes of contemplation, Kyouka had everything that she wanted to wear laid out on her bed. However, as she looked down at her chosen outfit, she felt that there was just something missing. She just couldn't lay her finger on it.

"The fishnets."

"Ah!" Kyouka yelped, jumping in surprise. Her mother stood in the doorway of her room, smiling at her daughter. "How'd I not hear you?!"

"I have my ways. Now, back to the topic at hand." Mika walked further into the room and opened up Kyouka's dresser, pulling out the article of clothing she mentioned earlier. She laid down the black, rhinestone fishnet leggings. "He likes your legs. Might as well give him a little bit of eye candy."

Kyouka looked away with a blush, but her regular glare never left her face. "How do you even know that?"

"He's a very polite young man, but even he's not strong enough to resist a passing glance every time. Boys will be boys, after all. And if he's anything like your father, then h-"

"No! I DO NOT want to know what Dad's into!"

Mika chuckled, raising her hands in defense. "Alright, alright. I get it. There is something we do need to talk about, though. We haven't had the chance to discuss your new boyfriend."

"Now?"

"Now."

Kyouka sighed, knowing that there was no way out of the situation. "Technically he's not my boyfriend yet."

"Last night you two seemed pretty close to me."

"We're dating, just not official. A test drive, so to speak."

"So sucking his face off counts as a test drive?" Mika asked with a smirk.

"Get out."

Mika laughed again, placing a kiss on top of her daughter's head. "Have fun tonight. That is if my assumption that these clothes are for a date is correct. By the way, you will be talking to your father about all of this."

"Sure, when I'm thirty."

Mika rolled her eyes, but left Kyouka alone to get ready. She was able to hear her daughter's heart pounding in her chest. She was obviously nervous enough. The last thing she needed was for her father to be panicking about the date as well. It didn't matter how much he didn't want his daughter to grow up. She would make him promise to lay off the overprotective parent act, even if just for the night.

...Right after she unlocked him out of the recording studio.

...After Kyouka left.

***...~AMP~...***

*\*Ding-Dong\**

Izuku fiddled with the sleeves of his forest green button-up shirt as he rang the doorbell. He wasn't sure if he should wear them down at his wrists or roll them up his forearms. All Might had said, "***Show off your muscles! Ladies love that...I think.***"

Izuku was starting to realize that Toshinori wasn't exaggerating when he said he had no experience in dating women. Showing off like that wasn't his style, and he doubted Kyouka really cared about that. Well, she had mentioned his physique before. Did she like his muscles?

"Oh, trust me. I like them plenty."

Izuku slightly jumped, his focus had distracted him so much that he didn't realize the front door had already opened. He also didn't notice that he was apparently muttering to himself. "S-Sorry, I was distrac-...ted…"

Izuku was fairly certain that he would have to call off the date and go to the hospital, because it felt like his heart stopped beating.

Kyouka stood before him wearing lace-up black combat boots ending just a little over halfway up her calves, a black mini pencil skirt that hugged her body perfectly, and black fishnet tights. For every two diamonds that the nets formed, there was a rhinestone. There was a silver chain running from the front of her waistband to the back of it. Tucked into her skirt was a red shirt of the band "Black Flag" with their logo in black. She was donning a midriff black leather jacket, three white stripes ran down the front on the left side.

Her accessories consisted of a spiked bracelet and a couple of chains around her wrist, and a black leather choker necklace. The necklace of the choker was a single .308 bullet dangling by a chain over Kyouka's chest. Her already beautiful face was accented by black lipstick and a dash of purple eyeshadow.

In that moment, Izuku felt even more like the luckiest man alive.

Kyouka smirked at him, gesturing down to his arms. "Is that a new fashion trend I don't know about?"

Izuku was shocked out of his stupor, looking down at his sleeves to see that his indecision had caused him to have one sleeve rolled up and the other still down at his wrists. "O-Oh."

Kyouka chuckled, closing the door behind her before taking his other arm and rolling up the sleeve for him. "Looking good, Loverboy."

"Y-You look perfect. Better than perfect. I-I can't really put it into words."

A smile graced Kyouka's face, '*Mission accomplished.'* 

She leaned up and kissed his cheek and—

*\*Click\**

Their attention was grabbed by Mika taking multiple pictures of them through the window. Kyouka raised her jacket over her head to hide her face, quickly grabbing Izuku's hand and speed-walking away from the house. "Ugh, sorry about that."

"I-I don't really mind. If our situations were reversed, we'd have to be leaving my apartment by boat due to my mom's tears. I'll choose taking a picture over that."

"Well, hopefully there are no more surprises like that." She looked up at Izuku's face, he was looking away awkwardly. "...What?"

"...About those surprises."

***...~AMP~...***

**(15 Minutes Later)**

"...You didn't."

Izuku smiled, rubbing the back of his head with a blush dusting his cheeks. "I did."

"Well, I guess I never *actually* answered your question so...I appreciate all forms of music. However…" Kyouka's smile was wide as she scoffed and shook her head at the building in front of her. "...No. I don't particularly like jazz."

*Ryuji Twilight Jazz Club*

Big red neon letters and all.

"But I am so down for this being our first date." Kyouka quickly grabbed Izuku's hand and rushed inside. Not even two seconds inside, Kyouka immediately flinched at the music playing from the stage further in the building. "Ugh, even worse: *Freeform* Jazz. Just play the right notes, you freaks."

Izuku laughed at her criticisms. He had actually put a lot of thought into the location.

A place with significant meaning to them: Jazz.

Related to something Kyouka loves: Music.

And, where Kyouka can do something she loves: Make fun of and judge people...eh, playfully, of course.

It was perfect.

After talking with the greeter, they were led to a booth near the back of the dimly lit building. Most of the interior was composed of dark wood paneling. The large, rounded booths were made with maroon leather, and the dim lights above each table varied in their colors. The main light in the room was coming from the stage at the front. Izuku had specifically asked for a booth in the back, because the rest of the patrons obviously came to the club because they enjoy the music.

He highly doubted any of them would want to hear Kyouka's constant laughing and satirical beratement of their favorite music.

They sat down next to each other, both facing the stage as a new group readied their instruments. After ordering their drinks, the band began to play. Kyouka immediately began to groan, but also laugh to herself. "Uuuugh, heheh. The drummer looks so lost. Did he forget that his job is to improvise?"

Izuku watched her listen to the band in pure hilarity, while he was somewhat confused. It wasn't exactly his thing, but it wasn't "Awful" per say.

"What's so wrong with jazz, anyway? Why does it have such a bad reputation?"

Kyouka turned to him looking like she was trying to figure out how to word her next sentence, "Okay, look. Jazz isn't actually bad. There's plenty of awesome jazz out there. But, stuff like freeform jazz just lacks everything that I— and plenty of other people— am looking for in music. I need structure, a build-up, an actual point to listening. I want my music to have a message, emotion. Stuff like this is just musicians trying to be cool. It's not for us, it's for themselves."

"So...you want your music to be for the people?"

"Well, like everything we do, there's always something about it that is for ourselves. Satisfaction, pride, excitement, etc. But, music has just always been something that I think is for the people. That's what we make it for, isn't it? For people to listen to it? It has power."

Izuku nodded, understanding where she was coming from. However, there was still something he was wondering. "Music really is important to you, isn't it?"

Kyouka smirked, "Oh, really? Whatever could have given you that idea?"

"What I meant was, music is a major part of your life. It had to have been before heroes were. Why didn't you become a musician? O-Or, at what point in your life did you realize that being a hero is what you wanted to do?"

Kyouka furrowed her brow in thought, leaning back into the booth as she thought about Izuku's question. "I wanna say around age ten or eleven. It just sort of happened. I didn't have a hero obsession like you. I had no real favorite hero either. Being a hero was just so incredible to me. Saving lives, giving people hope, putting my life on the line for the sake of others. I'm passionate about music, but I knew my heart was with heroism. There's no doubt about that. But, it was my parents who really showed me that those two halves of my life aren't so different. In fact, I could make them one."

Izuku raised a brow curiously, "What do you mean?"

"You know how I told you I was afraid to tell my parents I wasn't going to be a musician? When I did, they just told me that I should do what I wanted to do. They told me that their love for music was just a simple liking to it, but it eventually evolved. They realized that their music could actually do things for other people. That's when I fully realized that being a hero and being a musician isn't so different after all. I said I want my music to have a message, to be for the people, to invoke emotions. That's being a hero, isn't it? To share your message to the world, to teach them, to work for them, to invoke emotions in them like hope and happiness. Music can help people in their darkest times, just like heroes do. That's what I want. I want my work as a hero to be my ultimate song that I give to everyone." She looked back at Izuku, who was watching her with wide eyes. Kyouka blushed heavily, twirling one of her jacks around her finger. "I went off on a tangent there, didn't I?"

"No! That was incredible! I understand completely. I've never thought about musicians that way." Izuku rubbed the back of his head a little embarrassed. "Honestly, I-I've never really thought about any other sort of profession that way. Pro heroes have always been my definition of hero. There's never been anything else."

Kyouka smiled, leaning against Izuku. "I'm glad I could broaden your horizon."

Izuku blushed at the contact, but slowly put his arm around Kyouka. "So, your parents are heroes?"

The thought almost made Kyouka laugh, but only because the thought of her crazy, overprotective father and her down to Earth, chill mother as heroes was weird to her. But she knew the truth.

"Yeah. I'd say so. What about you? When was the moment you realized being a hero was what you wanted to do?"

"I-It was a video of All Might I saw as I kid."

Kyouka began to chuckle, "Why am I not surprised? How did you not crap your pants whenever he announced that he would be our teacher?"

"I'm n-not so obsessed that I would do that!"

"Debatable, but continue."

"It was just a video of All Might saving people, carrying them on his back. I watched it so many times." Izuku laughed at himself, remembering when he had no chip on his shoulder. "I would beg my mom every single day to play it for me. I was just so mesmerized. Just the idea of being able to save people like that with a smile on my face, like I was invincible, bringing hope to so many, destroying evil...I couldn't think of anything more amazing to do than that."

"And what about now?"

Izuku furrowed his brow in confusion, looking down at Kyouka. "W-...What do you mean?"

"Everyone starts off with reasons like that, yeah. But, it always changes. We get older, experience new things, learn, all that stuff. I wanted to save lives because I thought it was cool, but then I learned just how much I could do for people and what I can give. My hero work is my music. You were listening, right?" She asked sarcastically, nudging his side. "What I'm trying to say is, why exactly do you want to be a hero now?"

Izuku was silent for a little bit, clearly thinking about what Kyouka had said. "I've never really thought about it before. At least, I haven't really tried to. I guess...I guess it all just comes back to my quirklessness. Kind of like everything in my life, apparently. I-It's not really something I like to talk about. Or think about."

Kyouka pursed her lips as she listened attentively, relaxing a little further into Izuku. By that point the music wasn't even noticeable to them. "You told me a little, and I obviously don't have any experience in that department, but...it was difficult, wasn't it? Being quirkless I mean."

Izuku scoffed, fiddling with the hem of his shirt as he seemed to zone out. He spoke under his breath, "...Difficult doesn't even come close."

Kyouka knew immediately not to press further. Not tonight. It was a date, and the last thing it needed was to talk about someone's troubled past that they were clearly uncomfortable about. Kyouka wasn't a relationship expert, but even she knew that was definitely something that was classified as "Not for a relationship only 24 hours old".

Hell, did that even qualify for a friendship only a couple of months old?

Either way, it wasn't a conversation for that night. There would be time for that later down the road.

Kyouka decided to make Izuku switch from fiddling with the hem of his shirt, to her fingers by slipping her hand into his. "As difficult as listening to this music?"

Joy returned to Izuku's eye's, "For you, being quirkless might've been a cake-walk compared to having to listen to freeform jazz."

Kyouka flinched as someone's trumpet blasted with a high-pitched tune, completely going against the rhythm everyone else was performing at. "Yeah, maybe you're right."

The night continued on like that. The conversation flowed as usual, with neither of them changing their positions of leaning against one another. Except for one moment where Kyouka decided to test something out and cross her legs with exaggerated movements. She saw Izuku's eyes glance down for just shy of a few seconds before he realized what he was doing and looked away.

Another mission accomplished.

The topics of their talks varied wildly.

…

**(30 Minutes Later)**

"So, you're telling me that you've never had another pair of shoes? Do you just buy the same pair in different sizes every year?"

Izuku faltered, "Well..."

"You've gotta be freaking kidding me. What if they discontinue that shoe?"

"Don't scare me like that."

…

**(30 Minutes Later)**

Kyouka deadpanned at Izuku's question, "Does it *look* like I can pierce my ears?"

"Wh-What about the rest of your ear? It doesn't have to just be the earlobes."

"Are you just asking all this because you're secretly attracted to piercings and want me to get one?"

"Are you deflecting my questions because you're secretly afraid of getting piercings?"

"..."

"..."

Neither of them wanting to admit to the questions, they moved on to another topic.

...

**(30 Minutes Later)**

"...Are you done?"

Kyouka waved him off, "Just hold on." She sat with her phone in hand, an image of All Might displayed on the screen. Izuku was putting his "All Might Face" on display for her to compare with the photos. "I can't find a single difference. I don't even understand how it's physically possible. You can't just develop and then get rid of wrinkles like that. And how the hell do you make more shadows?"

After nearly two hours of being in the restaurant, the conversation was still going strong. They were so focused on one another that it took Kyouka two hours to realize something.

"Does this place not serve food?"

Izuku's eyes widened, realizing that the only menu that they had ever received was a drink menu, the waiter had never come back, and every table in the building didn't have food either. "...Damn it." Kyouka instantly began laughing at his expense and both of their ignorance, facepalming as her body shook with laughter. "Wh-What do we do now?"

Kyouka's laughter subsided and she shrugged her shoulders, "Plan B?"

"I guess being in attacking distance from your dad would make this date thrilling."

"That's the spirit." They got up from their seats, making their way to the front desk to pay. When they got there, the greeter asked them if they enjoyed the music.

Kyouka merely laughed.

***...~AMP~...***

"So, here's the plan of attack."

Izuku stopped in his tracks, "Plan?"

The teens stood on the sidewalk leading towards Kyouka's house after picking up some take-out. They were only a few houses away from their destination. "What? Do you think we can just walk through the front door? I'm not going through that. There are no parents allowed on this date.

"Then what are we going to do?"

Izuku grew scared as Kyouka slowly began to smile.

***...~AMP~...***

"This is ridiculous."

"Quit your whinin' and keep climbin'."

Izuku grabbed onto another branch, lifting himself higher up the tree. They had walked to the house next to Kyouka's and were climbing the tree in the side-yard. It was close enough to Kyouka's window where the duo would be able to enter. Which would be a whole lot easier if Kyouka hadn't decided that she wanted another piggyback ride. "Not that I mind, but why can't you climb again?"

"I might not be like most girls, but I still care about my outfits. This stuff is expensive. Besides…" She lifted up their bag of food. "...someone's gotta carry this."

Under his breath Izuku whispered, "*As long as the fishnets aren't damaged."*

"What?"

"What?"

"...You do remember I have super-hearing, right?"

"Ahem! A-Anyway, are you sure this is okay? This isn't your tree."

Kyouka nodded, "My neighbors are cool. They won't mind."

"What about your mom? Even if we get in, won't she be able to hear us from anywhere throughout the house?"

"We still have to focus on sounds to hear them, but either way she's not who I'm worried about. She'll understand. My dad, however…"

"I feel bad hiding from him." He hoisted them onto the strongest branch near Kyouka's window.

"I would too, if he didn't overreact at everything. Now, I left my window ajar in case of this exact situation. Just a sec." Her jacks extended out, going under the window frame and lifting it upwards. Izuku carefully stepped inside, placing Kyouka down.

The lights immediately flicked on, revealing Kyoutoku at the doorway. Izuku and Kyouka sat wide-eyed, staring awkwardly in silence at the man. "I really hope U.A has a course in stealth, because you two are terrible at it."

"M-Mr. Jirou, I just want to say that I-I-"

"Stop." Kyoutoku sighed, running a hand through his hair. "I see no point in asking you your intentions or true feelings for my daughter. I may be overprotective, overbearing, all that jazz. But, I'm not stupid. Nor am I blind. Just...Just take care of her. Alright?"

"Y-...Y-Yes, sir. With everything I have."

"And also remember that if you hurt her, in any way, shape, or form, I will pulverize you until you're nothing but dust. So then I will roll up your remains into a cigar, only to be smoked while I stand over your unmarked grave in the middle of the Mojave."

"...Um…"

"And that's only if I get to you first. You don't want to know what Mika would do to you. Well, have a good night you two." He walked out, closing the door behind him. Both teens stood there, still confused about what had happened.

Kyouka was completely flabbergasted. What had happened? Last time she checked, her father still couldn't accept the idea of her dating somebody. And that was two hours ago. "What the hell was that?"

Izuku put a hand over his chest in relief, "I think I just used up the last of my luck for the rest of my life."

"I'll...I'll talk to him later." Kyouka looked at the door, still confused on where that all came from. But, she would just need to take what she could get and move on. For now at least. "Just get set up. I'll get the movie." Heading over to her shelves, Kyouka found the movie she was looking for. Turning back around, she stopped to see Izuku just staring at the bed. "You okay?"

"Hm? O-Oh, yeah I just uh...Where do I sit?"

Kyouka lifted her brow in confusion, "The TV is in front of the bed, so...on the bed."

"B-But…"

"Dude, this isn't the first time you've sat on my bed."

"True, but it's different this time. We're...you know."

Kyouka blushed, "Oh. I guess that's true." Two friends sitting on a bed together was a lot different than two people in a relationship sitting on the bed together. "Well...it *is* a test drive. And it's only weird if we make it weird. We've sat side by side plenty before."

"Yeah, but...now it's on a bed."

"How am *I* the one somehow being the more adult one in the scenario?"

"I just don't want to cross a boundary!"

"I invited you here, didn't I?"

Izuku rubbed the back of his head, "That's true."

Kyouka shrugged, "I know we both don't really know what we're doing. But, if we were comfortable being close as friends, we should definitely be comfortable doing it now. If anything, we have even more reason now than before."

Izuku blushed, but sat down. "Fair enough. So what are we watching?"

"Ashido was gushing over this film, and when I said I hadn't seen it she brought it to school the next day and shoved it into my hands. It's a really old movie from the late 1970's. It's some sci-fi called "Alien".

"Oh, I've heard of that. It's a science-fiction horror film."

Kyouka's eyes widened, "...Horror?"

"Yeah. Is something wrong?"

"N-Nope. Nothing at all. I'll pop it in." Kyouka looked down at the box and internally slapped herself for not reading the front of the box closely.

"*In space, no one can hear you scream."*

'*Who am I kidding? This was made over a century ago. It's probably super cheesy and fake-looking. It won't be that bad.'*

***...~AMP~...***

"WHAT THE HELL IS THAT!!!"

Izuku had never been too affected by horror films. He found some legitimately creepy, making him not like being alone in the dark for a couple days or so. And "Alien" was definitely one he was finding to be really good. But, now he couldn't be scared as his mind was too occupied by two other feelings.

One was hilarity as he found Kyouka's reactions comical.

The other was...a mixture of a few teenage, hormonal emotions as Kyouka was clinging to him for dear life, her attention completely absorbed by the screen. Kyouka's arms were like a vice around Izuku's body as she stared at the infant Xenomorph burst out of the character Kane's chest.

If he learned anything that night, it was that Kyouka really wasn't a fan or horror.

She nearly crushed Izuku's ribs when the alien suddenly scurried across the table and out of sight. "Ashido, you sick daughter of a bastard. How the hell does she like this shit?"

Horror also made her swear a lot more than usual.

Izuku shrugged, "You have to admit that even if you're scared, you're definitely enthralled."

"About as enthralled as a germaphobe would be watching footage of a sewer system. I'm utterly uncomfortable, but can't look away."

"Isn't that the point of a good horror film?"

Kyouka used her chopsticks to pick up a large amount of noodles and shoved them into Izuku's mouth. "Shut up, it's the next scene."

Not realizing that she just proved Izuku's statement, they continued to watch the movie. As the rest of the crew, minus Ripley, began to die off, Kyouka would continue to comment. Most of them being "idiot" whenever someone was killed.

Izuku could tell that their training was paying off. He was pretty certain that Kyouka had dislocated one of his ribs when the alien revealed itself in the air ducts with Dallas. It wasn't until near the end of the film that Kyouka finally seemed to go back to her normal behavior. Ripley had just sent the xenomorph out of the airlock and into space.

"Hehehehe! Hahahaha, oh my God!"

"What?"

"It seriously took me until just now to realize it's just a guy in a suit." She put her hand over her face, trying to hide her embarrassment.

Izuku couldn't help but laugh as well. "What did you think it was?"

"I don't know! Animatronic or something." The alien, while floating aimlessly through space, then proceeded to float back to the spacecraft and seemed to accidentally bang it's face against the ship with a loud *PANG*. "Pffft, hahahahahahahaha! You've gotta be kidding me. That was so worth the two hours of terror."

"Well, I'm glad you at least enjoyed one part."

"Are you kidding me? I loved it."

Izuku's eyes widened and his brow furrowed. "Wh-? But you seemed to hate being scared."

"Oh, of course I do. This was an experience that'll give me nightmares, and I blame you entirely."

"You chose it!"

"We wouldn't have had to watch a movie if you had checked beforehand if the club had food."

"I...Crap, you're right."

"If this relationship is going to continue, you better get used to that fact," Kyouka joked. "But, seriously. I may or may not have been scared shitless that entire time," her jacks menacingly moved in front of Izuku's eyes. "And, you will tell absolutely nobody about that, but I really did enjoy it. Now I'm going to avoid this like the plague, as I do with everything horror related."

"What about the sequel?"

"...Sequel?"

Izuku nodded, "It's called 'Aliens'."

"Aliens? Plural? As in more than one of those freaky things?"

"Yeah. Like, hundreds of them."

"Fuck that."

Izuku smiled, "Not if Ashido has anything to say about it."

"I'll only watch it with you. If you weren't here, I would've turned off the movie in the first ten minutes."

The credits were still rolling, the light of the television illuminating Kyouka's already porcelain to have an ethereal glow. Her violet eyes were even more prominent, the light making them more amethyst. Izuku swallowed, already regretting the garlic noodles he had eaten. Hopefully Kyouka didn't care. They slowly leaned in, their noses already touching. The first kiss was feather-light, their lips ghosting over the other's. The second was a real kiss, their lips pressing against each other fully. "S-Sorry about the garlic. I-"

"Dude, we ate the same things. Who cares?" Not giving him a chance to respond, Kyouka kissed him again, her arms reaching up to cup his face with both of her hands. Izuku snaked his arm that wasn't propping himself up around Kyouka's waist.

After about a minute, their lips disconnected. Kyouka placed her head on Izuku's shoulder, her heart rate trying to slow down. They sat like that for what seemed like hours as the credits finally ended, returning the screen back to the main menu. At the very beginning, Izuku had so many fears about intimacy. For his entire life, he had been closed off from most comforting touches. Before Kyouka he couldn't even get near a girl without becoming a complete catastrophe. Now that he has it, though? He wasn't sure if he could live without it. There was a major difference between regular heat and body heat. And he definitely preferred the latter over the former. Granted, he was still hesitant. He was never particularly sure where was an okay place to put his hands. Obviously there were a few that were definitely off-limits.

Unless the relationship became serious, that is.

Although, even if he *was* allowed access, he was in no way ready for that. His heart might actually explode. This, however? The comfort and warmth of Kyouka's body, her smaller frame resting perfectly against his, was just perfect for the time being. It was everything he never knew he needed.

"Did you ever think this would happen?"

Izuku was taken out of his thoughts by Kyouka's question. "You and I? Or just in general?"

"Both, I guess."

The young hero shook his head, "In general, no. Not really. After word got out about my quirklessness, most people ignored. Including the girls. I sort of just accepted a long time ago that it would never happen. With everything else going on in my life at the time, not being able to enter a relationship was just another thing I couldn't have. Besides, I was so focused on being a hero that it didn't exactly cross my mind a lot. I mean, it did. Anyone would think about it at some point. I just didn't find it to be something that needed to be focused on too much."

Kyouka frowned, "I'm sorry you had to go through that. People can be such assholes."

"D-Don't worry about it. And, for you and I? Not really, at least for the most part. I might be able to analyze quirks, but I'm useless when it comes to analyzing social cues. I didn't think it could actually be a thing until the beach."

"What about our training made you think there was something between us?"

"...I-I meant the night before last."

Kyouka leaned back and looked him in the eye, "That's when we kissed!"

"Exactly."

She shook her head, but was smiling. "You really are dense sometimes, aren't you?"

"I've been told that before. Now what about you?"

"Me? Well…" Kyouka wasn't sure how much she should actually say. She really didn't want to point out her bodily issues, especially because she would likely have to go into specific things she didn't like. And that was too long of a list. "Really I was just too focused on getting into U.A. Maybe down the line at some point, but I didn't try for anything."

"And us?"

Kyouka pressed her lips together, "Hmm, sort of. Did I know you liked me? Yes. At least I was pretty sure."

"You did?"

"Neither of us were exactly subtle. It still took me a little bit to actually fully realize it. The real question was on if I should act on it. But, here we are now. I feel like I made the right choice. It also helps that for some reason I'm attracted to walking stalks of celery."

"You've already used celery."

"What do you want me to call you? Lettuce? I'm running out of green vegetables here. I can't do everything by myself."

Izuku laughed, looking past Kyouka to check the time on her alarm clock. He sighed, "It's about time for me to go."

"Damn it. Are you sure you can't just stay? I need somebody to talk to, because I sure as hell am not falling asleep after that movie."

"If you want, I'll call you when I get home. I'll talk for as long as you need me."

"It'll have to do." Sadly, Kyouka got off of the bed with Izuku following. After making their way downstairs, they reached the front door.

Izuku turned to Kyouka, "I-I think that went well."

"It really did. As our first test, I'd say we got the highest grade possible." Kyouka reached forward and hugged Izuku, her head on her shoulder. "Thank you for tonight, Izuku. I'll plan the next one."

Izuku returned the hug, "...Are you going to make me do something I don't like as revenge for the movie?"

"You assume too much if you think I'll spoil anything I have planned."

"I should've expected that." With one final kiss, Izuku departed in hopes to catch the next train before it left the station. Kyouka closed the door, leaning her shoulder against it as she simply stared off into space, thinking about the night's events.

"Would you look at that?" Kyouka turned to see her father walking down the staircase. "My Kyouka, *not* with a frown on her face? I would ask who you are and what have you done with my daughter, but I know you would kick anyone's ass before they had the chance to replace you."

His daughter scoffed, "Trust me, my usual look isn't going anywhere."

Kyoutoku walked over to the couch, leaning against the back of it, "You have a good time?"

Kyouka nodded, "Better than I could've hoped...Especially when a certain someone made an appearance." Her father turned away from the fridge to look at her, already knowing that conversation was coming. "What happened? Where in the world did any of that come from?"

"Who do you think?"

"...Mom?"

"I won't lie, I was freaking out. The second she told me that she thought you were going on a date tonight, I went full 'Dad-Mode'. But, then she locked me in the recording booth." They both laughed at the thought. "Then, she reminded me about who you were. About how you've never acted this way around...well, anybody. About how that green, mop-headed ball of anxiety must've really been special to you. That was already obvious saying that he was the first person you had ever brought over to the house, talked about openly, hung out with 24/7, and of course, sucked his face off."

"WE DIDN'T SU-..." Kyouka pinched the bridge of her nose and let out a deep breath. "Continue."

"Look, it's pretty clear that Midoriya is a great kid. And he's definitely smart if he realized how amazing you were. Not to mention brave. You can be pretty scary at times." Kyouka oddly found that flattering. "Just know that he's welcome here anytime, and he won't have to fear for his life. Just as long as he makes you happy. Keep in mind though, that doesn't mean Mika and I won't test him from time to time. C'mon, we're parents. It's in the job description."

Kyouka smiled broadly, "Thanks, Old Man."

The father chuckled, "There she is." He walked past her, but not before kissing the top of her head, and made his way back upstairs. Kyouka pulled out her phone, following her father to the second floor as she awaited her call from Izuku.

**(Jirou's Personal Recording Studio)**

Kyoutoku entered the studio, his wife turned to look at him from the mix table. "Do you feel better?"

"Only just a little."

"You'll feel a whole lot better once you see their relationship truly blossom."

He sat down next to her, taking her hand in his. "It's not like I could've stopped her anyway."

"Stopped her? Probably not. Troubled her? Yes, you would have. You know how much she cares about what we think, no matter how indifferent she may act. In her mind, her care for that boy would've trumped our authority. But, your relationship with her would've become strained. Besides, how long do you think you could've kept up this behavior."

"You don't know the patience I have."

Mika chuckled, "Either way, now Kyouka will be more comfortable having him out in the open with us. And I may like him, but that doesn't mean we shouldn't make sure our daughter is getting nothing but the absolute best. Which means…?"

Kyoutoku's eyes lit up, realizing what she was getting at. "Parental tests, here we come."
