Wind cut through Aris's hair, cold and sharp, carrying the metallic scent of ODM gear and the distant, almost sweet smell of Titan steam. Below, the ground stretched out in a patchwork of green and brownâforests giving way to open fields, interrupted by the skeletal remains of buildings that had stood before the fall of Wall Maria. From this height, everything looked manageable, almost peaceful. But Aris knew better.

He adjusted his grip on the triggers, feeling the familiar weight of his gear against his body. The gas canisters pressed against his hips, each movement a reminder of how much he had left. In his mind, he kept a running calculation: current altitude, wind speed, distance to the next anchor point, estimated gas consumption. It was automatic now, as much a part of him as breathing.

Behind him, the team moved in practiced formation. Jean took point on the left flank, his movements precise and economical. Connie covered the right, while Sasha held position slightly back, watching their six. Riegert and Thorneâthe two newer additions to the teamâstayed close, following Aris's lead with the careful attention of soldiers who hadn't yet developed the instinct for reading Titan behavior.

Aris raised a hand, signaling a halt. The team stopped mid-swing, finding anchor points in the scattered trees below. They hung suspended for a moment, gear whirring quietly, eyes scanning the terrain.

"Checkpoint seven should be just past that ridge," Jean's voice came through the wind, steady and familiar. "Want me to scout ahead?"

"Hold position." Aris tilted his head, studying the landscape below. Something felt off. Not wrong, exactlyâthere were no Titans visible, no immediate threat. But his instincts, honed by years of reading patterns, were picking up on subtle irregularities.

He pulled out his scope, adjusting the lens. The ground resolved into clearer detail: trampled grass, disturbed earth, the kind of signs that could mean Titan activity. But the pattern was wrong. Titans moved with a certain predictability, their paths following lines of least resistance, clustering around settlements and open areas. This looked different.

Connie shifted position, the movement catching Aris's attention. "You see something?"

"Maybe." Aris kept the scope raised, tracking the disturbed terrain. "The ground's been churned up, but not in a way that matches normal Titan movement patterns. They usually follow more direct paths."

"Could be abnormal Titans," Riegert suggested. He was young, only a year out of training, but sharp. "We've seen them act differently."

Aris lowered the scope, considering. Abnormal Titans were unpredictable, dangerous, but they still followed certain behavioral rules. This didn't fit. "Possible. But let's assume it's not until we know otherwise."

He signaled the team forward, keeping their altitude high enough to maintain observation distance but low enough to conserve gas. They moved slowly, deliberately, each member watching assigned sectors. Aris felt the weight of leadership settling on his shouldersânot just his own life, but five others, depending on his judgment.

They'd been moving for another ten minutes when Sasha's voice cut through the wind: "Movement. Three o'clock, ground level."

Aris swung his scope in that direction. Three Titans, normal type, moving across an open field. Their behavior was standard: wandering, aimless, heads tilted up as if searching for something that would never come. Nothing unusual there.

But then he saw itâthe way they moved wasn't random. They were spacing themselves, maintaining formation almost, like they were being herded. Or following something.

"Hold," Aris said, his voice low but clear. The team stopped again, settling into observation positions. "Watch their movement patterns. Tell me what you see."

Silence for a moment, broken only by the whisper of wind through their gear.

"They're moving in a line," Jean said finally. "Maintaining distance from each other. Titans don't usually do that."

"Unless something's directing them," Connie added.

Aris felt a chill that had nothing to do with the wind. Titans didn't coordinate. They couldn't. Unless someoneâor somethingâwas controlling them. But that would require a Titan shifter, and as far as they knew, all known shifters were accounted for. Unlessâ¦

"Vallois," Riegert's voice held a note of urgency. "They're changing direction. Coming toward us."

Aris looked up from the scope. The Titans had indeed shifted course, their movements more purposeful now. Not the aimless wandering of normal Titans, but something approaching intentional pursuit.

"Elevate," Aris commanded, and the team responded immediately, using their gear to climb higher into the canopy. Below, the Titans continued their approach, but they lacked the speed or coordination to follow into the trees.

Once they were secure in the higher branches, Aris motioned for a brief conference. The team gathered close, holding onto anchor points.

"That wasn't normal behavior," Sasha said, her tone matter-of-fact. She'd seen enough Titans to recognize anomalies.

"Agreed." Aris scanned the area below, looking for any other signs. The Titans had slowed now, almost as if they'd lost interest. "I want to investigate that area they were moving toward. Something drew them there."

Jean's expression was skeptical. "Protocol says we report unusual activity immediately. We're not equipped for investigating anomalies."

"He's right," Connie added. "This feels like something above our pay grade."

Aris understood their caution. He'd drilled the same protocols into his own mind a thousand times. Report first, investigate later, with proper backup and resources. But something in himâthe part that had learned to read patterns in the Underground, the part that had kept him alive by noticing details others missedâwas screaming that this was important. That if they left now, they'd lose something critical.

He weighed the options: follow protocol, return safely, report what they'd seen. Or take a calculated risk, investigate quickly, gather intelligence that might be gone by the time a proper team could return.

"Here's what we do," Aris said, his voice carrying the authority of someone who'd made this kind of decision before. "Limited investigation. Five minutes, maximum. We observe from altitude, don't engage. If anything looks wrong, we retreat immediately. No exceptions."

"That's still a deviation from protocol," Thorne pointed out. She was older than Riegert, more experienced, and her tone held no judgmentâjust fact.

"I know." Aris met each of their eyes in turn. "I'm making the call. If you disagree, speak now. I won't hold it against you."

Silence. Then Jean shrugged. "Your call, leader. But if we die, I'm haunting you."

"Fair enough." Aris allowed himself a small smile, though it didn't reach his eyes. "Keep formation. Watch for Titans. And for anything else."

They moved cautiously, descending just enough to maintain observation while staying mobile. The area the Titans had been approaching was a small clearing, bordered by forest on three sides. As they got closer, Aris began to notice details that made his stomach tighten.

There were signs of recent activity. Not Titan activityâhuman activity.

"Look," he said, pointing. The others followed his gesture to where the undergrowth had been cleared in precise, methodical patterns. Not the random destruction of Titans, but the careful work of someone using tools.

They landed at the edge of the clearing, weapons drawn, scanning for threats. The area was empty, but evidence of habitation was everywhere: a fire pit that had been carefully extinguished, the remains of a shelter that had been dismantled with deliberate care, scraps of fabric and material that didn't match anything produced within the walls.

Aris knelt, examining the fire pit. The ashes were still warm.

"Someone was here recently," Sasha said, her voice quiet. "Within the last few hours, maybe."

"But who?" Riegert asked. "Survey Corps teams haven't been in this area. We'd have reports."

Aris stood, studying the clearing. The shelter had been well-constructed, using materials that suggested someone who knew how to survive in Titan territory. The fire had been built to minimize smoke. Whoever had been here was skilled, experienced, and trying not to be noticed.

"Marley scouts," Jean said, and the words hung heavy in the air. "Has to be. Who else could be out here?"

Aris felt his pulse quicken. If Marleyans were this close to the walls, conducting reconnaissance of their own, it changed everything. They weren't just a distant threatâthey were actively gathering intelligence, positioning themselves.

"We need to search the area," Aris said. "Quickly. Look for anything that might tell us who they were, what they were doing, how many there were."

The team spread out, moving with practiced efficiency. They didn't have much timeâTitans could return, and whoever had been here might come back. Aris focused on the fire pit and the area immediately around it, looking for anything that might have been left behind.

He found it tucked under a half-burnt log: a small, metal object, roughly cylindrical, with markings that didn't match any writing system he'd seen before. It was warm to the touch, and when he turned it over, he saw what looked like mechanical componentsâgears, springs, the kind of technology that was beyond what Paradis had access to.

"Vallois." Thorne's voice carried urgency. "Titans. Converging from multiple directions. We need to move. Now."

Aris pocketed the object and signaled for immediate retreat. The team had already identified their escape routeâAris had mapped it on the way in, noting anchor points and wind patterns. They launched upward, using the trees for cover and propulsion.

Behind them, Titans began emerging from the forest. Not just the three they'd seen earlier, but moreâfive, then eight, then a dozen, all moving with that same coordinated purpose. Aris felt adrenaline surge through his system, the familiar rush that came with danger, but he kept his focus on the escape route, on the team's positioning, on gas levels and wind speed.

"Stay in formation!" he called out, his voice cutting through the sound of their gear. "Don't break the line. Thorne, you're drifting leftâcorrect course. Riegert, watch your gas consumption."

They moved as a unit, Aris leading, the others following his trajectory. His mind calculated angles and distances automatically, adjusting for wind, finding the most efficient path. Behind them, the Titans continued their pursuit, but they lacked the speed to match ODM gear in forested terrain.

Still, it was close. One of the Titansâan eight-meter classâcame too close to Connie, forcing him to change trajectory mid-swing. The sudden shift cost him gas, and Aris saw the readout on Connie's gear dip into the warning zone.

"Connie, fall back to the center. Jean, cover his position."

The team adjusted seamlessly, years of working together making the shift feel natural. But Aris felt the weight of responsibility pressing down. If he'd made a different call, if they'd left when protocol demanded, they wouldn't be in this situation.

They broke free of the forest, emerging into open terrain. The Titans behind them slowed, their pursuit losing momentum as the cover disappeared. Aris pushed for more altitude, the team following, until they were high enough to be safe but low enough to maintain speed.

After another ten minutes of flight, with no sign of continued pursuit, Aris signaled for them to slow and regroup.

"Status check," he called out.

"Clear," Jean responded.

"Clear," Sasha echoed.

Connie's voice came through slightly breathless: "Gas at forty percent, but I'm good."

"Thirty-five percent," Riegert reported.

"Forty-two," Thorne added.

Aris checked his own readout: fifty-eight percent remaining. Enough to get back, but tighter than he'd like. "We'll take the direct route. Checkpoint eight, then straight back to base. No deviations."

"Understood," Jean said. "And Vallois? That was a damn good call back there. Whatever we found, it was worth the risk."

Aris felt a small measure of relief at the words, though it didn't fully erase the lingering tension. The risk had paid offâthey'd discovered something important. But it had also put his team in danger, and that was a weight he'd carry.

They made the rest of the return journey without incident, the terrain familiar enough that Aris could navigate on autopilot while his mind worked through what they'd discovered. Human activity outside the walls. Marleyan technology, most likely. Titans being directed or herded somehow. Each piece of information was significant on its own; together, they suggested something bigger, something more dangerous than simple reconnaissance.

By the time the walls came into view, the sun was beginning to set, painting the sky in shades of orange and red. The return journey had taken longer than planned, and Aris could already imagine Levi's reaction to both the deviation from protocol and the late return.

They landed at the Survey Corps headquarters, their gear settling into place with the familiar sound of releasing pressure. The team moved through post-mission routines automatically: securing equipment, filing initial reports, the kind of rote activities that helped process the adrenaline crash.

Aris caught Hange's eye across the courtyard. The commander had been waiting, which wasn't a good sign. Levi stood nearby, his expression carefully neutral in a way that usually meant he was holding back criticism.

"Vallois," Hange called out. "Debriefing. Now."

The team exchanged looks. Jean gave Aris a sympathetic pat on the shoulder. "Good luck."

Aris followed Hange and Levi into the debriefing room, where maps and reports covered every available surface. He stood at attention, though neither commander seemed particularly concerned with formalities.

"Report," Levi said, his voice even.

Aris detailed the mission: routine reconnaissance, the discovery of unusual Titan behavior, the decision to investigate, finding evidence of human activity, the retreat. He left nothing out, including his deviation from protocol. When he was done, he pulled the metal object from his pocket and set it on the table.

"This was at the campsite. I don't recognize the markings or the technology."

Hange immediately moved closer, picking up the object and examining it with the intensity of someone seeing a puzzle they'd been waiting to solve. "This is Marleyan technology. Or at least, it's not Paradis technology." They turned it over in their hands, tracing the markings. "The mechanical components suggest communication equipment, maybe. Or tracking. Hard to say without proper analysis."

Levi's attention hadn't left Aris. "You deviated from protocol."

"I did, sir. I judged that the intelligence value outweighed the risk."

"And if someone had died? Would the intelligence still have been worth it?"

Aris held his gaze. "No, sir. But I made the call based on the information available, and I'd make it again under the same circumstances."

Levi was quiet for a long moment. Then he nodded, just once. "I don't like deviations from protocol. But I respect judgment calls from experienced soldiers. Don't make me regret that respect."

"Understood, sir."

Hange set the object down, their expression thoughtful. "This is significant. If Marleyans are conducting reconnaissance this close to the walls, it means they're planning something. Or preparing for something."

"Or they're already in position," Levi added grimly.

The implications settled heavily in the room. They'd known Marley was a threat, known that conflict was coming. But this was concrete evidence that it was closer than they'd thought.

"Write up a full report," Hange said finally. "Include everythingâthe Titan behavior, the campsite, the object. I want details. And Vallois? Good work. Risky, but good work."

Aris nodded, though the praise felt hollow. He'd made the right call, and they'd discovered critical intelligence. But he'd also put his team at risk, and that was a weight he'd carry.

He was leaving the debriefing room when Armin found him in the corridor. The younger soldier looked thoughtful, which usually meant he'd been processing something complex.

"I heard about the discovery," Armin said. "Human activity outside the walls?"

"Marleyan, most likely. Evidence suggests recent reconnaissance." Aris kept walking, and Armin fell into step beside him.

"That changes things. If they're this close, gathering intelligence, it means they're either preparing for an attack or trying to understand our capabilities." Armin's mind was clearly working through possibilities. "The coordinated Titan behavior you observedâthat's concerning. We know Titan shifters can control normal Titans to some extent, but this level of coordination suggests either multiple shifters or a shifter with advanced control abilities."

"Or something else entirely." Aris reached the stairs, pausing. "We don't know what they're capable of. We don't know what else they have."

"No," Armin agreed. "But we're learning. And every piece of information matters."

They parted ways, Armin heading toward the libraryâprobably to research whatever theories the discovery had sparkedâwhile Aris made his way to the quarters he shared with Historia.

He found her still at work, though the hour was late. She sat at the table with a lamp burning, surrounded by papers and correspondence. When she looked up and saw him, her expression shifted from tired focus to concern.

"You're late," she said, setting down her pen. "I was starting to worry."

"Mission ran longer than expected." Aris dropped into the chair across from her, feeling the weight of the day settle into his bones. "We found something."

He told her about the discovery: the unusual Titan behavior, the campsite, the Marleyan technology. Historia listened without interrupting, her expression growing more serious as the implications became clear.

"This means they're close," she said finally. "Closer than we thought."

"It means they're active. Gathering intelligence. Preparing." Aris leaned forward, elbows on his knees. "Historia, if they attackâ"

"We'll handle it." Her voice was firm, though he could see the worry in her eyes. "We've handled worse. We'll handle this too."

Aris wanted to believe her. But he'd seen too much, lost too much, to fully embrace that kind of certainty. Instead, he reached across the table, taking her hand. Her fingers were cold, and he wrapped his around them, trying to offer warmth, trying to ground himself in the reality of her presence.

"You're thinking ahead again," Historia observed softly. "Working through scenarios. I can tellâyou get that look in your eyes."

"What look?"

"The one where you're calculating angles and trajectories, except instead of ODM maneuvers, you're calculating threats and responses." She squeezed his hand. "You can't plan for everything, Aris. Some things you just have to face when they come."

"I know." He did know. But that didn't stop him from trying.

Historia stood, moving around the table to sit beside him. She leaned against his side, her head resting on his shoulder, and for a moment, they just sat together in the quiet of their quarters. Outside, the headquarters was settling into evening routines. Inside, there was just the two of them, and the weight of everything they'd learned, and the knowledge that the peace they'd been holding onto was more fragile than either wanted to admit.

"Tomorrow," Historia said, her voice quiet, "I have meetings about resource allocation. You'll be writing your report. We'll both do what we need to do."

"And the day after that?"

"We'll handle that when it comes." She lifted her head, meeting his eyes. "Right now, we have tonight. That's enough for now."

Aris leaned in, pressing his forehead against hers. She was rightâthey had tonight, and for now, that had to be enough. Tomorrow would bring its own challenges, its own discoveries, its own weight. But right now, in this moment, they had each other, and the fragile peace of knowing that whatever came next, they'd face it together.
