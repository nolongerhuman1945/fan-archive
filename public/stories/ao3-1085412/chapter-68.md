Amelia lowered the omniculars and glared at the ancient wand shop across the narrow and uneven Roman street. She was secreted away in a small room on the second floor of a guest house opposite to the shop which they were staking out. The air was a touch chilly despite the early morning sunshine and she was glad of her comfortable battle robes. She reached for the small cup at her elbow and breathed in the bitter scent of espresso coffee. She sipped appreciatively.

"I don't know how you can drink that muck." Alastor grumbled behind her.

"Remind me why I invited you along again?" Amelia said dryly.

"Harrumph." Alastor retorted. He plucked the omniculars out of her grasp, raised them and grunted. "We've got movement at the bottom of the alley." He tutted. "It's a cat."

"I'll alert the others." Amelia snarked.

Alastor shot her a disgruntled look. "When's Black's appointment?"

"Eight." Amelia checked the time. "It's coming up on seven." Nerves fluttered in her belly but years of operations and missions had her controlling them with steely practice. She took a deep breath.

There had been weeks of planning for the op, Amelia reminded herself, and a great deal of diplomatic cooperation between England and Italy to work out the details. It was just as well Hatter was back in charge of the Department for International Cooperation because Merlin knew Crouch would have bollixed it up. She felt a pang for thinking bad of the dead but pushed it away dismissively. She hadn't been fond of Crouch Senior when he was alive and she wasn't going to pretend because he'd passed on – especially given the mess he'd left behind with his son.

Alastor hummed beside her and tapped on the communication mirror. "This is Eagle's Nest. Position check."

"Italian Stallions are in position."

The crisp response only held a hint of an Italian accent. Marco Morello, the Head Italian Auror, was highly educated and intelligent, a force to be reckoned with. He was also familiar with Sirius having worked with him in the war, apparently had a similar sense of humour, and was eager to assist. It helped that the Italians had been tracking Cavietti for years but had never gotten enough evidence of illegal activities to make any charges stick. The Italians had staked out the café next door to the wand shop as their hidey-hole; two experienced Aurors had replaced the usual waiters while the rest of the team had taken over a back-room.

"Rat One in position." Keith Brooks replied.

Amelia pressed her lips together. Brooks was positioned in the alley behind the wand-shop disguised as a homeless beggar huddled into the walls.

"Rat Two in position." Marina Ambrey confirmed, her visage floated over the mirror and she was making faces as though pretending to check her appearance as she was stationed by the apparition point in the Roman courtyard just around the corner.

"Rat Three, the Dog and Bone are in position." Tim Chambers confirmed although the mirror stayed dark. He was back in England, watching over the exit point at the portkey office.

And that was the last of the Rat Squad involved with the op. Wood and Cambridge had been left out to keep following up any leads in England on Voldemort and the others' whereabouts.

"Next position check in fifteen minutes unless the buggers turn up." Alastor ordered. "Eagle One out."

"Shouldn't I be Eagle One?" Amelia complained good-naturedly.

"I still beat you out on age, lass." Alastor wagged his finger at her and picked up his flask. He took a swig of his drink and smacked his lips exaggeratedly. "Nothing like a good cup of tea."

"If that's just tea in your flask, I'm a monkey's uncle." Amelia commented. She tapped her cup with her wand and it refilled with more aromatic coffee.

"So," Alastor said brightly, "I heard you put Tonks on a sabbatical so she could guard Lupin abroad."

Amelia darted a quick look at him and wasn't fooled by the patently false innocent look he'd plastered on his misshapen face. "She invited you to the wedding, didn't she?"

"No sense of discretion that one; didn't even have security spells on the letter." Alastor agreed. "Rita might be watching herself now but it's only going to be a matter of time before another one of those vultures gets wind of it if Tonks doesn't smarten up."

"She's driving Sirius to distraction." Amelia sighed heavily. "If she wasn't on a sabbatical, I'd call her on the carpet."

Alastor grunted. "Didn't stop me. I sent her a Howler. You should do the same. Might knock some sense into her. Getting herself up the duff's no excuse for becoming an idiot."

"Alastor!" Amelia admonished him even though she inwardly agreed with his assessment.

She was disappointed in Tonks; she'd had such high hopes for the young Auror. Despite Tonks' family connection and her skills, Amelia knew the unplanned and out of wedlock pregnancy would impact the young woman's career and her future prospects, particularly with her male superiors. The fact that it had happened with a werewolf regardless of who he was and the position he held…

Amelia grimaced, shamefully recognising her own prejudicial bias but unable to completely suppress her horror at the thought of intimacy with someone who carried the lycanthropy disease. If he bit her in a moment of passion…it didn't bear thinking about.

But Remus was a good man and an honourable wizard. He was doing right by Tonks in marrying her and had taken the sensible approach of taking them both abroad to hopefully delay the revelation of the union and prospective addition to the House of Black until Sirius and the Potter alliance had done enough to minimise the political fallout.

It would be a shame for Lupin, Amelia thought, if the consequence of the dalliance undid every positive measure Sirius had secured for his oldest friend. Quite honestly, Amelia could hex both Tonks and Lupin for their selfish behaviour. What had they been thinking?

Maybe Alastor had the right of it, Amelia mused; maybe she should send Tonks a sharp reminder not to be idiot.

"We have movement." Alastor said suddenly.

Amelia snatched up the omniculars and scanned the street. Cavietti was approaching from the North end. With his small stout stature Cavietti appeared to roll rather than walk. She sniffed in disgust at the oily black hair and overly groomed moustache. The wand-maker barrelled up to the café and went inside for his usual morning double espresso.

Ten minutes later, he barrelled back out and made for the door of his shop. He had tucked the morning paper he had snagged from the café counter for their customers under his arm.

"Thief." Amelia muttered under her breath.

Cavietti weaved his wand in a complex pattern to unlock the wards and a moment later he was in the door.

The mirror flared to life. "Fevrier's arrived and on his way." Ambrey reported crisply, even as she mimed checking her lipstick. "Two others with him; man and woman." The mirror went black again.

"Got them at the South end." Alastor said. "Coming up the street now."

The mirror flared again. "I've got company. Black cat; unusual markings; sitting on the wall outside of Cavietti's. Going silent." Brooks said tersely.

"An animagus?" Amelia wondered out loud. There was no record of any of the missing Death Eaters being an animagus apart from Pettigrew, but then there'd been no record of Sirius either.

Alastor grimaced. "Could be a familiar. Kneazle could spy well enough."

They watched as Cavietti greeted Fevrier and ushered the French antiquities dealer and the unknown couple inside.

"Trap's set then." Alastor said darkly.

Amelia checked the time again. Only thirty minutes to go before the op began in earnest. She tapped her fingers restlessly.

"Rat Three reporting." Chambers' voice drifted out of the mirror. "Dog and Bone are on the way." There was a pause. "I've got an interested party who watched them leave. I'm following up."

"Call for back-up." Amelia ordered.

Alastor glared at the mirror as it winked out. "They're travelling early."

"Timing is everything." Amelia corrected. "Don't forget they have to have cleared customs, before apparating and walking up to the shop."

Alastor subsided. Amelia frowned. She wished in some ways that they could have had everyone in Italy overnight but the security considerations had ruled that out. She took a gulp of hot coffee and almost choked as it burned its way down her throat. With her mind occupied with whether everything would go as planned at the Italian Ministry she almost missed Alastor's flinch.

"What?" asked Amelia sharply.

"Flash of green inside the wand shop." Alastor said darkly.

Amelia's heart seemed to stutter in her chest. "The Killing Curse?"

"I would say so." Alastor frowned. "If we assume the unknown man and woman are Death Eaters then it's either Fevrier or Cavietti."

"Fevrier." Amelia said. "They don't need him anymore. Maybe they had him under Imperio."

"Well, we'll get them for murder." Alastor said with satisfaction.

The mirror buzzed.

"Cat's been let in the back door." Brooks reported tensely.

So the Death Eaters had secured the shop.

Amelia tapped the mirror. "Eagle's Nest to Italian Stallions. We have circumstantial evidence a murder has taken place in the wand shop. Jurisdiction is yours. Do you wish to abort operation and attempt arrest now or continue?"

"Continue." Marco appeared in the mirror; he was a stunningly beautiful man; clear olive skin, dark brown hair cut into a fashionable style, twinkling green eyes and a mobile mouth that could smile disarmingly.

"Acknowledged." Amelia said crisply and closed the connection. She would not have made the same decision but it was not hers to make.

Alastor grunted beside her. "He's after Cavietti, remember?"

"Cavietti could be the one murdered." Amelia rejoined.

"You and I know that's not bloody likely." Alastor remonstrated.

Amelia sighed. She hoped Chambers was having better luck.

o-O-o

It only took a quick mirror call to have the rest of the Rat Squad in England on their way to support Chambers as he unhurriedly tracked the ambling figure of a non-descript Caucasian man with balding hair and in a cheap everyday robe down Diagon Alley towards the Leaky Cauldron.

There was no doubt in Chambers' mind that the guy was suspicious. The suspect had been lurking around the international portkey office since early that morning ever since a Disillusioned Chambers had arrived as part of the surveillance duties. The guy had made a show of making enquiries about the price of international portkeys to Russia but he hadn't made notes, had discarded the pamphlets the ever helpful Beryl Pootle had given him in response and had continued to lurk. He'd also almost snapped to attention when Chambers' charges had arrived to await their portkey allocation and departure. But the most suspicious act had been to press *his left arm* momentarily as soon as the portkey for Italy had activated and leave without further ado.

The guy wasn't tagged as a Death Eater which meant either he was a new recruit or he was one of the missing prisoners. Either way Chambers was determined to get him as a matter of pride for the Squad.

They were working their arses off, Chambers thought a touch belligerently, but the only real successes that they'd had were the arrests at the World Cup and tracking down the Summers woman in the crypt – and even those successes had been tempered by Travers' escape and the lack of progress on waking the two hostages they'd rescued.

Ahead, his unhurried suspect got to the Leaky and tapped on the wall to open up the entrance. Chambers sped up as the wall closed again, and hurried to catch up. He made himself visible, tapped the wall and entered as though unconcerned, sliding to the left and casting a tempus charm with a scowl as though waiting for someone.

His suspect was at the bar talking to Tom and retrieving a key, there was a flash of the number eight when Chambers glimpsed the fob. Chambers slid further into the shadows as Bald Guy went up the stairs to a Leaky room.

Just as he got out of sight, Wood and Cambridge stepped into the Leaky from the alley. Chambers caught their attention.

"He's upstairs in room eight." He reported crisply.

Wood, the senior most member of the Squad, nodded. "Good work, Tim. Darren, you stay down here, get the anti-transportation wards up, close the floo down, and get Tom to quietly evacuate as many people as possible through the exits."

"Right-o." Cambridge sent a quick grin to Chambers.

Chambers rolled his eyes and followed Wood up the stairs. They both drew their wands and took a position either side of the door. Wood signalled with one hand that they'd go on a count of three. Chambers gave a nod.

Wood held up one finger.

Two.

Three.

Wood swept his wand at the door, unlocking and slamming it open in one fell swoop. Chambers charged in.

"Aurors!" Chambers shouted at the balding man by the bed. "Surrender your wand NOW!"

The man swallowed hard, his eyes darting about the room looking for an escape. Chambers had his wand levelled on the suspect and knew Wood had his back.

"What…what is the meaning of this?" Bald Guy stuttered, his gaze still sliding about; his wand still held tightly in his grip.

Chambers gritted his teeth. "Put down the wand. We will fire on you."

Bald Guy made as though he was going to place the wand on the bed but at the last moment he whirled away and grabbed something off the dresser.

Chambers and Wood fired.

Their stunning spells slammed into Bald Guy who dropped like a stone to the hardwood floor. Woods cast an immediate binding spell on his hands and feet.

Chambers made his way over and kicked the comb the Bald Guy had grabbed. Portkey, Chambers realised. It failed due to the wards, but it could elicit information on a safe house for the Death Eaters or Voldemort's location. He levitated it into a conjured evidence bag.

"Well, well, well." Wood said with immense satisfaction capturing Chambers' attention.

"What?" Chambers looked down at their captive and grimaced at the flexing features as they morphed out of their polyjuiced state. "Well, well, well, indeed." He grinned at Wood before crouching down to poke the still stunned Death Eater at their feet. "Nice to see you again, Dennis the Elder. Don't you worry; we'll soon have your sorry carcass back in Azkaban."

o-O-o

"Dog and Bone on their way." Ambrey's disembodied voice sounding from the mirror had Amelia jumping and Alastor sending Amelia such a look of chastisement she flashed back to her Auror training.

She raised her omniculars just in time to see the figures of Sirius and her own brother enter the street. Her heart seemed lodged in her throat as she tracked them to the shop. Why had she thought this was a good idea?

"Steady, lass." Alastor said under his breath, not unkindly.

The two wizards drew level with the wand shop. Her brother's gait was missing its usual joie de vivre and there was no excited hand gestures to accompany his speech as the two men discussed something briefly. They approached the door and rang the bell.

Amelia drew a quick breath as Cavietti answered the door and ushered them inside. As they had thought, Fevrier was likely dead. "It's going to be two against four." She said under her breath.

"They're both capable wizards." Alastor stated without hesitation.

"Italian Stallions reporting to all: wards have gone up. We have erected our own."

Amelia settled back but she couldn't hide the flinch when almost immediately there were flashes of light in the wand shop. She tapped the mirror urgently.

"Spell fire! Back-up needed NOW!" Amelia ordered.

Immediately, the two Aurors masquerading as waiters rushed to the shop and blew open the door, another two rushed out of the café to support their colleagues.

Alastor was already moving and Amelia dimly heard the sound of the door as he left, the clop of his leg as he charged down the stairs. She kept her gaze pinned to the shop, poised to report any sign of escape.

"I've got the cat going out the back." Brooks reported suddenly. "Pursuit in progress. He's heading to the apparition point."

"I'm on it." Ambrey confirmed.

Amelia watched as Alastor hurried across the street, he paused taking a position to the side of the door momentarily as he drew two wands, and having glanced through the opening, he went inside.

"One cat animagus captured." Brooks reported, smug satisfaction dripping from every word. "Ambrey took him down at the apparition point; we have Boris Dolohov?"

Amelia frowned. Antonin Dolohov in Azkaban and Boris was his younger brother. Boris had fled to the Continent and they had been unable to argue for his extradition when Romania had declared him to have been under the Imperius and innocent.

Alastor's voice suddenly crackled over the mirror. "We're all clear. Looks like we've got a team of newbies."

Amelia didn't wait. She grabbed the mirror and charged out. Her descent down the stairs and across the tiny street was a blur. She met a grinning Marco at the door of the shop.

"Director. Ladies first, of course." Marco swept his arm out, inviting her into the wand shop.

Amelia pushed through, noticed absently that the four Italians had each taken a corner of the room to cover which was almost text book Auror standard procedure, and hurried over to the centre where Alastor stood with the other two Brits in the room – their wands all pointing downwards at the bound and gagged witch and wizard they'd disarmed, and an unconscious Cavietti.

She ran her eyes over the two man who'd played bait; their clothing was a bit ruffled, there were a couple of tears in the material, but neither looked harmed in any way.

"Alright?" She asked anyway.

Sirius's face contorted into a sneer. "A little singed…"

Marco immediately drew his wand and pointed it at Sirius. "You are NOT Sirius Black!"

Amelia placed herself between them hurriedly, both hands up. "Neither of these men are who they appear to be. Both are part of the team for this operation."

Marco's eyes flashed with displeasure but he lowered his wand. "Polyjuice?"

"Yes." Amelia said. "My apologies for the deception but we could not risk this detail leaking in anyway. Lord Black was adamant that he could not participate in person and I would not risk a civilian such as my brother. The real Lord Black and Lord Bones never left the Italian Ministry."

"Then I suggest we adjourn there with our prisoners." Marco said shortly.

Amelia had a feeling she was going to get lectured about keeping information from him as Head Auror – she wouldn't be pleased in his position either – but that Marco was sensible enough not to make a bigger deal of the deception than what was required.

"Search the shop." Marco grinned at his gleeful Aurors. "We will have much to discuss with Cavietti."

The mirror buzzed in her hand.

"Eagle, here." Amelia responded.

Chambers grinned back at her. "We got Travers Senior, ma'am."

Amelia smiled darkly. "Get him into a holding cell. Rat Squad only as his guard. Tell Fudge and Scrimgeour that they'll answer to me if they go anywhere near him before I get back."

"Yes, ma'am." Chambers blinked out.

Amelia exchanged a gleeful look with Alastor. It had been a very good day.

o-O-o

Sirius couldn't quite prevent the blush which crept up his neck and across his cheeks as Marco stepped out of their farewell hug and grinned at him wickedly.

"It was good to see you, Siri." Marco said softly. "Bring your son to visit. I would love to host you both."

Sirius was touched at the sincerity. "It was good to see you again, Marco."

Marco's grin dropped away as he shifted position and bowed sharply to Richard, Amelia and Alastor who were looking on with glee.

"I present the Minister's thanks on bringing this criminal activity to our attention, Director Bones." Marco said formally.

"We present our Minister's thanks on your cooperation in this matter." Amelia replied.

"I will leave you. Your portkey will activate in a few minutes." Marco said. "Until next time."

His eyes searched out Sirius one last time and he was gone, stepping out of the privacy bubble Alastor had conjured up as soon as they had arrived in the small Ministry transportation room.

"So you and Marco *worked* together during the last war?" Richard enquired teasingly.

Sirius inwardly sighed but showed no sign of his dismay knowing it would only lead to more teasing. "He was undercover for the Italians with the Death Eaters in the same gang I was. We were both made aware of each other in case we needed assistance." He said with a straight face.

"And?" prompted Amelia dryly, getting her own back for all the times he'd teased her about Brian no doubt.

"And nothing." Sirius said firmly. He wasn't ashamed of his past relationship with Marco, which in truth had been more about simple companionship with someone who understood in the midst of the Death Eater horror they'd both faced undercover, but it was past and it was nobody else's business.

"Well, you would have been better warming blankets with him than Kelp." Alastor said bluntly. "She was cold enough to freeze a man's d…"

"Alastor!" Amelia snapped before he could complete the insult.

Sirius snorted with amusement. "He's not wrong."

"You should floo him when we get back." Richard said. "He's clearly still interested."

Sirius shook his head. As flattering as it had been to see the regard and affection still in Marco's gaze, Sirius had his hands full with Harry. "*I'm* not interested."

"You could do with some fun in your life." Richard coaxed. "And a partner would be able to give you a lot of support with Harry."

Sirius shook his head. "I'm happy as I am, so; thanks but no thanks." He wagged a finger at his friend. "No match-making." He turned to Alastor. "Thanks by the way for whatever you said to Tonks. She mirror-called last night and apologised for the lapse in security."

"Sent her a Howler." Alastor said with satisfaction.

"You still planning on making the announcement at the April session?" Amelia jumped in, continuing the subject and cutting off her brother.

"Yes." Sirius nodded. He, Daniel Greengrass and Cornelius had been over the political ramifications until they were all exhausted. It had been a hugely lucky stroke finding out Rita's secret just after the second task. Really he owed Susan and Hermione some kind of present for that.

"I can't believe her behaviour." Amelia commented with a touch of exasperation. "She's always been so level-headed."

"I think Bogdan offering to do the wedding made it suddenly a Big Thing rather than a quiet family occasion, and it made her a bit giddy." Sirius offered diplomatically. It was either that or hormones, and he wasn't going to suggest the latter in front of a woman; he valued his life too much to risk it.

"Giddy, my arse." Alastor huffed.

"She has acted without considering her House and the consequences at all." Richard said soberly. "She's lucky you're so understanding, Sirius. Another Head of House would have disowned her."

"She wasn't raised to consider the House and she's very young." Sirius said, feeling a little defensive on his cousin's behalf. "This whole thing has been one very big life lesson for her."

"Well, there's nothing like parenthood to make you grow up fast." Richard said. "Flick and I found that out with Sue."

"Portkey." Alastor reminded them.

They all reached forward and grabbed the ticket that had appeared in front of them.

Sirius felt the pull of the transportation and gathered himself for the landing. The reception room at the Ministry of Magic was non-descript but it was manned by an official who checked their wands and identities.

"Geoffrey," Amelia greeted him by name, "did the others return alright?"

"No problems, Director." Geoffrey doffed an imaginary cap and bowed his head at the sight of Sirius and Richard. "M'Lords."

Amelia led the way out and into the Ministry. Sirius followed, ignoring the tiredness – it had been an extremely early morning – and the slight nausea caused by the international portkey.

The holding cells were below the Auror Department and they arrived to find Rufus Scrimgeour pacing his office like a caged lion.

"I'd best deal with this one on one." Amelia said briskly. "Why don't you head down there? Alastor knows the way."

Richard held up his hands. "I'll say goodbye here. Flick's expecting me for lunch." He shook hands with Sirius. "I'll see you on Monday at the alliance tea?"

Sirius nodded his agreement. "Thanks for all your help today, Richard."

Richard grinned. "I did nothing but sit with you in a wonderfully comfortable office and eat lots of those amazing almond biscotti. Shacklebolt did the hard work."

It had been Kingsley who'd taken Richard's form and face as part of the operation, while Dawlish had taken Sirius's. It had been slightly disconcerting seeing someone else wear his own features, Sirius considered wryly.

Sirius shook himself at Alastor's sharp admonishment to stop lollygagging. He returned Richard's wave of goodbye and followed his old mentor. Sirius was pleased he'd remembered to mirror call Harry before they'd returned from Italy and hadn't deferred it to until he'd gotten back to England. Harry's relief at the op being over had been visible and Sirius was assured his son was no longer wearing out Minnie with nervous energy.

The path down to the cells held some nostalgic memories of his time as a Hit Wizard; of working with James. Sirius was glad of the silence as Alastor and he made their way to where Travers Senior was being held.

Cambridge and Wood were outside the door; one positioned to the left of the door so it would offer cover if opened; one positioned on the wall opposite just off centre to the door.

"Director's on her way." Alastor said as the two men straightened. "Where's Chambers?"

"Scrimgeour wanted his report written up straight away." Wood replied.

Alastor grunted.

Sirius sighed. The Head Auror could be petty and pernickety at times, but then Amelia had cut him out of the Italian operation so it was perhaps understandable that he wasn't too pleased by her riding roughshod over him on interrogating a recaptured prisoner.

"How did the Italian job go, sir?" Cambridge asked eagerly.

"Boris Dolohov cracked like an egg. Least his brother had some gumption about him." Alastor said bluntly. "Had a visit from his brother's old friend Greyback who'd put him onto the return of their master. There'd been rumours in the criminal world of Fevrier and Cavietti running a scam on Black so Dolohov invited himself along."

"He intended capturing me and offering me to Voldemort in return for his brother being rescued from Azkaban." Sirius added, conjuring up a chair and sitting down.

Alastor eyed the chair and called him a wimp under his breath before continuing. "His wife Gorgonia killed Fevrier and tried to kill Shack when he was Lord Bones."

"Her brother tried to kidnap Dawlish who was pretending to be me." Sirius said.

Wood started chuckling. "And Dawlish left him alive?"

"Watch what you say, Wood." Alastor said sharply. "Dawlish may be a pain in the arse but he is one of ours."

Wood held up his hands. "No digs intended. Just can't see my old partner taking to almost being kidnapped kindly."

"And to answer your question," Sirius stepped in before they could argue about Snape any further, "he wasn't impressed but the bad guys are all alive and in Italian custody. They'll be tried for their crimes there. Unfortunately they had limited knowledge of what was going on back here. According to Dolohov when he was under truth potion, Greyback put them in touch with our friend in there," he waved at the cell door, "to provide them with notice of mine and Lord Bones' departure. Travers Senior apparently owed the Dolohovs a favour and agreed to do it because of that. Dolohov had no idea if Voldemort even knew of his effort."

There was a sound from the bottom of the corridor and they all turned, wands out, to see the approaching forms of Amelia, Cornelius and Rufus. Chambers brought up the rear.

Sirius stood up and dismissed the chair with an absent-minded wave. He greeted Cornelius who praised them all effusively.

Amelia finally broke into the Minister's ramble. "Rufus has convinced me it would be better for me to focus on the prosecution without being associated with the questioning of the prisoner so he'll be taking lead here."

"I'd appreciate you sitting in, Moody." Rufus said gruffly.

Alastor nodded.

"Cambridge, Wood; you'll continue to guard the outside of the cell." Rufus ordered briskly. He unlocked the cell and marched inside without further ado; Alastor at his heels. The door clanged shut behind them.

"The rest of us will observe." Amelia motioned to the next door along and they all trooped in. Amelia tapped the adjoining wall and it became transparent.

Rufus sat with his back to the observers; Dennis Travers Senior sat bound up in ropes to a chair on the opposite side of the table. Alastor stood behind him, a looming threatening presence.

Rufus reached into his robes and brought out parchment, quill and a vial of veritaserum.

"I'm not going to tell you anything." Travers snarled angrily. "I know my rights! I want a solicitor!"

Rufus bared his teeth in a simile of a smile. "You have no rights, Travers. You're an escaped prisoner. If I wanted to I could send you straight back to Azkaban, no questions asked." He pulled another parchment from his inner pocket. "This here is a special warrant giving me the authority to use any force necessary in your questioning due to your involvement in terrorist activity which is a direct threat to the security of the wizarding world."

Travers stiffened.

Rufus nodded at Alastor and in a swift couple of motions, Travers had been frozen, his mouth yanked open and the requisite dosage of veritaserum dropped down his throat.

They waited a moment for the truth potion to take effect.

Rufus set the quill to record. "Name."

"Dennis Travers."

"How did you escape from Azkaban?" Rufus asked briskly.

"Bartemius Crouch Junior disguised as the Minister released myself, Mulciber and Rookwood into his custody." Travers droned in a monotone detached voice.

Sirius shivered.

"Where have you been hiding since your escape?" Rufus continued.

"On the Durmstrang ship docked in the Black Lake at Hogwarts." Travers immediately replied.

"Who knows you are there?" Rufus asked, shifting with barely concealed excitement.

"My Lord and Master, the traitor Karkaroff, Bartemius Crouch Junior, Peter Pettigrew, the Lord and Master's familiar, and my son." Travers recited.

Sirius exchanged a brief look with Amelia and Cornelius; the confession was a good enough to secure an official move to search the ship. Hopefully combined with all Bogdan had already done unofficially they could be aboard within a few hours.

"What contact have you had with your Lord and Master?" Rufus asked.

"I met with him on the first night of my escape; I have met with him every other week since my escape to make my report." Travers was clearly regaining some awareness because sweat had broken out on his brow – a sign he was resisting.

"How do you meet with him?" asked Alastor.

"I go through the Vanishing Cabinet aboard the Durmstrang ship and exit through the matching one in the cottage where my Lord and Master resides." Travers gasped.

"This cottage is where?" Rufus pressed.

Travers struggled against the serum furiously, turning a shocking shade of purple before he stuttered out a location; a village in the Lake District.

It was enough.

Amelia whirled away immediately just as Rufus was getting to his feet in the cell. They would have a search and a raid to prepare and get in motion. Sirius silently refused Amelia's offer to join them. He wanted to hear the rest of the interrogation.

Alastor slid into Rufus's place. "Why were you at the Ministry today?"

"To assist Boris Dolohov in his attempt to capture Sirius Black." Travers confessed to that easily enough. "I was to ensure Black left for Italy on schedule and contact them if there was any delay."

"What else did you know of the plot?"

"Only the timings." Travers said, struggling against the potion again.

"How did you get into the Ministry?" Alastor demanded.

"I ran the Department governing transportation for a number of years. I have back doors into transportation system including the floo network. I flooed into my old office without being detected." A bead of sweat ran down the side of his face.

"Tell me everything you know about the plot to return your Dark Lord to a body and to kill Harry Potter."

Travers gulped and looked anywhere but at the ruined face in front of him. "The last task." He said finally. "He'll take the boy during the last task as the final part of some ritual. He wants Snape to do the potion because he thinks Pettigrew will screw it up. That's all I know."

"And what will your Dark Lord do to ensure that he takes the boy?" Alastor pressed.

"I don't know." Travers stuttered out. "Crouch is the only one who knows." He slumped over suddenly.

Alastor raised his wand and ran a diagnostic spell on him. He sniffed. He packed up the parchment, quill and serum, and leaving Travers unconscious in the chair left the room.

Sirius met him in the corridor. "Shouldn't we get a healer?"

Alastor shook his head as he started walking. "Passed out. He'll come to eventually."

A vague sense of déjà vu swept over Sirius and he frowned as he remembered a fairly similar occurrence in his training.

"You said that about Kevin Mucky back in 'eighty-one and he'd had a heart attack." Sirius reminded him.

Alastor stopped walking and turned back. "Oy, Cambridge! Do another diagnostic on the prisoner. Might have had a heart attack." His eye whirled. "Nice catch, Black. I always did get those results confused."

Sirius shook his head and repressed the urge to smile despite his twitching lips.

"You should think about signing back on." Alastor said as they made their way back up to the main level. "You and Potter were my best students."

"I'm happy enough doing what I'm doing." Sirius insisted, ignoring the small pang of disappointment that he couldn't sign back on as a Hit Wizard. Harry, he reminded himself; he was playing politics and looking after the estates for Harry.

"Harrumph." Alastor said and pushed open the double doors to enter the Auror department.

"There you are." Amelia snagged hold of Sirius and waved a hand at Alastor. "Rufus wants your advice on searching Cumbria."

Alastor limped away and Sirius allowed Amelia to hustle him out of the Auror department and through the Ministry corridors to her own office.

She sat him down and had an elf bring them coffee. She produced a box of biscotti from the pockets of her robes and set it down on the desk between them.

"I've been ordered to keep you out of it." Amelia told him baldly. "Cornelius is flooing Bogdan to push for an immediate raid on the ship and Rufus is leading on the Lake District angle."

"And by giving you the job of keeping me out of it, they're…"

"Also keeping me out of it too." Amelia picked up her coffee. "I annoyed both of them with keeping control of the Italian operation but I have no regrets. I'll let them have this."

Because it was unlikely that either situation would result in more arrests, Sirius surmised. The instant Travers had been arrested, it was likely Voldemort's lot had been informed in some way if only by Travers' absence. But it was possible that they'd find something at either location and Amelia was generous enough to step back and allow her colleagues some of the glory.

Sirius watched in amusement as Amelia drained her cup and looked longingly at the coffee pot. "You're going to be bouncing off the walls if you have another."

Amelia set her cup down and simply smiled back at him. She picked up one of the almond biscotti from the box in front of them. "These are fabulous."

"Italians have some of the best cuisine in the world." Sirius agreed. "You and Brian should have a holiday out there. Harry has a villa in Tuscany and I have an apartment in Rome. You're welcome to make use of both."

"That might be one of your better ideas." Amelia said, brushing the crumbs from her robes. "I could do with a break." She smiled again. "I might even have earned it today." Her gaze narrowed on Sirius. "You know Richard wasn't wrong about Marco's interest. You could go back to Italy yourself with Harry for a holiday and renew old acquaintances."

Sirius sighed heavily and raised his eyebrows. "You're not seriously trying to fix me up, Amelia?"

Amelia grimaced exaggeratedly. "Merlin forbid." She held up a single hand. "I just…" she sighed and sat back in her chair, holding his gaze. "We're worried about you, Sirius. We're all your friends and I think you know we support you."

Sirius nodded bemused.

"So we're all aware that Remus Lupin is your closest friend and confidante." Amelia continued. "And that you have lost his supportive counsel and presence because of his relationship with young Tonks and that impacts on you." She didn't expand on the thought but Sirius got the gist of her concern. "A romantic partner would provide you with, perhaps not a replacement for Remus but an additional support for you."

"I appreciate the concern." Sirius said, after a long moment trying to organise his thoughts into a coherent reply. "Look, Remus and I talk every day, and no, it's not the same, but it's enough. Believe me when I say I have no interest in and no time for a romantic relationship of any kind right now."

Amelia nodded slowly. "I don't think Harry would object though should…"

"Harry," Sirius cut in, "has already given me pseudo-permission to date when we talked about it last year. But," he regarded her soberly, "you and I both know that underneath Harry's mature Champion of the Light and Leader of the Potter alliance exterior, is a scared fourteen year old who has already faced unimaginable horrors, who is prophesised to face more in his future, and who has spent the majority of his life being emotionally abused and physically neglected."

Her expression melted into comprehension. "And the last thing he needs right now is to feel in competition for your time and attention."

"He deserves to be put first for once in his life and to know it, to never doubt it." Sirius said simply. "And while Remus isn't available as much these days, I do have you and Richard and Daniel and many others to talk to when I need to talk or vent or whatever." He'd spent the night of the second task curled up with Minnie on the rug in front of the fire, the two of them in their animagus forms. Even as Padfoot he'd had nightmares of Harry being swallowed whole by the snake he'd faced. "I'm not without support."

"I won't say anything more about it then." Amelia said.

Sirius nodded with gratitude. He shifted position, readying himself to rise. "Well, as you can definitely claim to have kept me out of the latest operations, I'm going to head back to Hogwarts. I'll inform Albus about the probable raid on the ship and make sure I keep my son and his friends distracted from it."

Amelia's eyes widened with the sudden realisation of how the imminent raid might be foiled by a group of curious students. "Good plan."

He smirked at her slightly panicked expression and headed for the door. He paused in the doorway, tossing her a look over his shoulder. "Thanks, Amelia."

She waved him off dismissively and he shook away the feelings their conversation had stirred, the faint memories of another time, the remembered excitement of his old job, of being part of the team on an important mission. He had an important mission, Sirius reminded himself, and suddenly he couldn't wait to return home to Hogwarts and see his son.

o-O-o

"HEAR THIS!" Alastor's voice boomed through the school. "ALL STUDENTS TO COMMON ROOMS! ALL STUDENTS TO COMMON ROOMS!"

Harry morphed back into his human form and glanced immediately at his honorary Aunt.

The Deputy Headmistress frowned and motioned for Ron and Hermione to remain seated on the settee. She conjured up a messenger patronus and sent it off to Dumbledore politely requesting information.

"I think it would be prudent for us to remain where we are." Minerva said firmly. "I'm certain there is nothing to worry about."

The unspoken implication that it was possibly one of Alastor's 'constant vigilance' tests relaxed them all a touch.

Ron began laughing and pointed at Harry with his one paw.

Harry looked down at his fur-covered skin and sighed heavily. "I was distracted!"

Hermione's eyes were alight with amusement but she was valiantly keeping her laughter to herself. "At least you have fur." She sighed.

Her Head of House grimaced. "It may be time to admit defeat on the meditation process, Miss Granger, and find your form through a potion."

"I just don't understand why I can't see it." Hermione complained. "I do achieve a meditative state now but it's just cloudy! I can't see anything!"

"It's entirely possible that your age may be hindering the assumption of a form." Minerva said crisply. "Our teenage years are a key period in which our identity is formed and solidified. It may be that your own subconscious view of yourself is currently in flux and hence the cloudy view, as your inner self is changing, the animagus form is not known."

"I don't understand why Ron and Harry have forms though if that's case." Hermione questioned, folding her arms over her chest. She glared at both boys.

"They are not questioning their inner selves in the same way you are." Minerva held up a hand. "There is no right and wrong about that. Boys are more inclined to be definitive about their identities and less inclined to ponder their own personalities and behaviour; girls are more inclined to self-awareness and questioning of these things. It is not a failure on your part, Miss Granger. It is quite normal." Her eyes found Harry's and she smiled. "Harry's mother was unable to achieve an animagus form during her Hogwarts' years for similar reasons."

Hermione's lips drooped into a miserable frown. "So I'm not going to be able to become an animagus?"

"There's the potion." Harry said quickly, trying to cheer her up.

"There is but without a commitment to the animal shown by the potion, it will be incredibly difficult to transform into it." Minerva cautioned.

A white shining patronus shimmied through the door and flew over to the group. The phoenix patronus opened its mouth…

"Aurors are currently preparing for a sanctioned raid on the Durmstrang ship." Dumbledore's voice said calmly. "Please stay with Harry. I will have another teacher look in on Gryffindor."

Harry tensed. Sirius had called him to assure him that the Italian operation had been a success and that he was fine, but he'd heard nothing since. Perhaps the prisoners had confessed to the location of the conspirators who had sabotaged the Tri-Wizard tournament or given up Karkaroff.

Minerva hummed as the patronus dissipated. "Perhaps we should all revert to our human forms and have a snack." She waved her wand and Ron's hand morphed back.

Harry briefly closed his eyes and willed the fur away; he visualised his own skin and when he reopened his eyes the fur was gone.

"It's not fair," Hermione complained, "you have two forms and I can't even find one!"

"Talk to your parents and Sirius about the potion." Harry replied. "I'm sure they'll agree to you trying it."

Hermione sighed and nodded. She pushed her bushy hair back over her shoulders. "I wish I could do it your way though."

Ron shrugged. "It is really difficult." But his eyes gave away his inner delight and smugness that he had achieved something she had not.

Harry slipped his hand into Hermione's to support her. "You'll get it. I know you will." He reassured her.

Hermione sighed and squeezed his hand in a silent thank you.

The portrait door opened suddenly and Harry's wand was in his hand and pointed at the intruder immediately, Minerva spun around a split-second later with her wand ready too. They both glared at an unrepentant Sirius as the portrait door swung shut behind him.

Sirius winked at them but returned his attention to the hand mirror he held. "Thanks for the assist, Remus. Whatever you said to Bogdan worked because there's a dozen Bulgarian aurors who've turned up." He nodded absently. "As soon as I know anything. Padfoot out." He lowered his mirror. "Hi!"

"Really, Sirius," Minerva sniffed, "you could have let us know you were on your way. The school is in lockdown!"

"I know," Sirius said calmly, "Alastor almost wouldn't let me in." He opened his arms to Harry and they hugged hello briefly.

"What's going on?" asked Ron, curiosity written all over his face. "Are they really raiding the Durmstrang ship?"

Sirius nodded again. "Well, in about ten minutes or so." He gestured at the sofas.

Minerva excused herself to check on Gryffindor personally but Harry and his two friends took seats. Dobby popped in with refreshments and Sirius picked up a cup of tea with an appreciative sigh.

"Travers Senior was caught by the Rat Squad in the Leaky Cauldron this morning." Sirius waved vaguely in the air. "He was the look-out man here to make sure Richard and I were on our way to Italy; Chambers picked up on him, followed him and captured him."

Harry's eyes widened and he quickly deduced what had happened. "He's confessed they're using the ship."

"Of course!" Hermione said excitedly. "The Ministry would finally have enough cause to request an international warrant!"

Sirius smiled at them proudly. "Exactly." He motioned in the general direction of the Black Lake. "We've got a team of aurors and Bulgaria has sent some. They're going to be boarding shortly."

"What'll happen with Travers?" asked Ron, picking up a large chocolate biscuit and dunking it into a mug of hot chocolate.

"At the moment he's in the Prisoner's Ward at Saint Mungo's." Sirius winced visibly. "He really resisted the veritserum and put a lot of pressure on his heart. He had a heart attack and the Healers aren't optimistic."

"He probably wasn't in the best physical condition after being in Azkaban so long." Hermione murmured.

"It's not the best place for healthy living." Sirius agreed dryly. "I was lucky that I had my animagus form to shift into."

"I still don't have an animagus form!" Hermione repeated what had been said earlier about her identity being in flux.

Sirius nodded understandingly. "Lily had the same problem when she meditated in seventh year in an attempt to join us. She had to go with the potion in the end and she only took that after she and James had been married a while."

"What was she?" asked Harry eagerly.

"A doe." Sirius smiled sadly, his eyes unfocused as though staring back into the past. "She knew Prongs' form by then, of course, and as James' wife…magic pushed her into a complementary form. I think if she'd had the chance to do it properly she'd have been something else." He shrugged. "Either way she didn't ever master the transformation. Soon after she took the potion, she discovered she was pregnant with you."

Harry breathed in deeply, settling his emotions and his magic. He loved hearing about his parents and there was so much he still didn't know about them.

"Can I do the potion?" asked Hermione.

"You have to make it yourself." Sirius cautioned.

"She made polyjuice in our second year." Ron said, munching through his biscuit. "She'll be fine."

"I think it's just as well Minnie left." Sirius teased. "Otherwise you'd be in hot water." He pointed at Hermione who blushed.

"It was for a good cause." Hermione muttered sheepishly.

"Yes," Sirius said dryly, "breaking into the Slytherin Common Room and trying to find out if Draco was actually the Heir of Slytherin."

Hermione and Ron turned accusing eyes on Harry who held his hands up.

"I didn't tell him!" He protested before relenting enough to admit he had confessed all but only after Sirius had made it clear he had already known.

"Your brothers spilled all to Remus." Sirius said cheerfully to Ron.

Hermione huffed.

Ron looked appalled. "I didn't think they knew!"

"They must have overheard us talking or something." Harry said. Or maybe they'd realised the trio were constantly holed up in Myrtle's bathroom because they'd had the map and had investigated.

"I'll talk to your parents." Sirius offered. "If they say yes then I'll teach you how to make the potion."

Hermione's face brightened. "Thank you."

"So what happened this morning in Italy?" asked Harry, eager for details now the operation was over and done with, and Sirius was standing in front of him, uninjured.

Sirius grinned and launched into the tale to his captivated audience.

He was just explaining about the Italian Justice system the captured criminals would be faced with when he was interrupted by another announcement.

"ALL CLEAR!" Alastor's voice boomed. "COMMON ROOMS ARE NOW OPEN!"

"Does this mean the raid's over?" asked Ron excitedly.

Sirius took one look at their curious faces and sighed. He called Dobby who went to collect outerwear for Ron and Hermione. "Get your cloaks on. We'll go take a gander."

Harry smiled widely and raced upstairs to get his own cloak. Five minutes later they were out of the rooms and walking the still quiet corridors of Hogwarts. Most of the students had stayed in the common rooms despite Professor Moody's announcement.

Sirius herded them out of the entrance. As soon as they rounded the corner to the lake, they could see the bank filled with people; the team of British aurors were distinctive by their red cloaks but Harry could make out Bill and Caro talking with them. Amelia Bones stood off to one side in conference with the team of international aurors, Moody, Snape, a Durmstrang professor, and the Headmaster.

"I guess Amelia couldn't stay away," murmured Sirius.

Moody caught sight of them and waved them over. Harry glanced at Sirius who grimaced but nodded.

Hermione tucked her arm around his as they made their way over the muddy grass to lurk close to the group. Snape shot them an annoyed sneer as Moody made room for them all to join the huddle.

Dumbledore frowned at them a little but his attention was mostly on the Durmstrang professor who was protesting that he knew nothing.

"Igor vould not let anyone into his office all this time!" The small man blustered in a heavy Germanic accent. "He vould lock ze door and vould refuse us entry!"

Amelia sighed heavily. She looked worn and Harry felt a moment's sympathy as he remembered she'd been in Italy that morning with Sirius. "Thank you, Professor von Humberg. We'll let you return to your students."

"Gunther," Dumbledore interjected, "please convey our condolences to the students for the sudden death of your Headmaster. If there's anything we can do…"

Harry bit his lip. Did that mean Karkaroff was dead?!

Amelia cleared her throat. "Director Hatter will be here shortly to help you make all the necessary arrangements."

"The Minister will also be in touch. We will stay and provide additional support and security for the remainder of the tournament." The Bulgarian auror stood next to her said.

"Tank you." Professor von Humberg departed with the Bulgarians in tow.

"Karkaroff's dead?" queried Sirius soberly.

"As a doornail." Moody agreed brusquely. "They left him in his office. Any sign of the others is gone. They cleared it out."

"If the Dark Lord believed the ship and Karkaroff's involvement to be compromised, he would have ordered Karkaroff to be killed. He held no further value." Snape said evenly.

"Has the secondary team found anything?" asked Sirius.

"Secondary team?" asked Harry sotto voce to Sirius.

"Ah, Travers also mentioned where Voldemort was hiding." Sirius grimaced. "Didn't I say that?"

"No." Harry said, trying to hide his irritation. "I think I might have remembered if you had."

Sirius slung an arm over his shoulders. "I'm getting old; forgetting things. Truthfully, I didn't think much would come of it. Once Travers didn't make it back from his morning activities…"

"They would have ran." Harry sighed. "So we're back to square one."

"And a very nice square it is too." Sirius said brightly.

Snape snorted again in the background and Harry found it horrifying that he agreed with him.

Amelia shook her head. "They identified the cottage where we think Riddle and his gang holed up but, again, cleared out of anything useful." She shivered and huddled into her cloak. "We'll put forensics onto both the ship and the cottage. We might turn up something."

Snape huffed loudly. "The Dark Lord is not stupid. He will have left nothing."

"Doesn't hurt to double check, lad." Moody countered.

Dumbledore heaved a heavy sigh. "It is a pity Igor did not reach out for help. We could have perhaps saved his life."

"Unlikely." Snape said.

"He'd have gone back to Azkaban for conspiracy to terrorise, attempted murder, premeditated manslaughter with the death caused by the dragon, and harbouring fugitives and terrorists." Moody barked at Dumbledore. "His life was over either way."

And that was a depressing thought, mused Harry, feeling colder than ever. He had very little sympathy with Karkaroff – the man had made his own choices – but ultimately he had been doomed.

"If he's dead, does this mean the tournament is over now?" asked Ron, bemused.

"I'm afraid not, Mister Weasley," Dumbledore said briskly, "the tournament is only over if there is a winner."

"Or the contestants are all dead." Moody added.

Dumbledore sent him a reproachful look. "We are doing our best to circumvent the strictures of the revised parameters."

"It was good to know that there would have been a protective shield for anyone left in the cabin at the time of the explosion." Hermione offered supportively.

Harry held back his own snort at that. Bagman had cheerfully told them about the protective shield after the task had finished; Dumbledore had set it into the walls of the cabin and it would have flared into being had life been detected within the walls at the time the explosive hex was detonated. It was still dubious whether it would have worked or not.

Dumbledore beamed at Hermione and turned back to Ron. "We shall have to confer with Durmstrang once they have dealt with the initial aftermath of Igor's death. They will no doubt appoint a new Headmaster or Headmistress in time but it may be that someone like Professor von Humberg steps in as their judge for the final task."

"The tournament is the least of their worries right now." Amelia agreed. "Speaking of which; are we certain that anyone hiding out on the ship has gone and hasn't just assumed a new identity here at Hogwarts?"

"The Bulgarians are doing identity checks on this lot." Moody pointed his thumb behind him at the ship. "We may get permission to do the French again with this as evidence of foul play."

Amelia nodded. "I'll get Hatter onto it."

"If I were them I'd pretend to be a Hogwarts' student." Ron said casually. "Nobody ever checks our identities."

They all stared at him.

"That's brilliant, Ron." Harry congratulated him, thumping Ron on the arm.

"It is very insightful." Amelia agreed.

Sirius smiled proudly at the youngest Weasley male who was now as red as his hair.

"Hmnph." Moody said. "Take ten points for Gryffindor, lad."

"Indeed." Dumbledore said.

Snape rolled his eyes behind Moody and Harry felt his lips twitch into a smile as he took in Snape's disgusted expression.

"Well, can we do a student check?" asked Amelia.

Dumbledore frowned. "Not without parental permission, I fear. The Board of Governors is also likely to have an opinion."

"What about the map?" pondered Harry. "Professor Moody could take the map for a day or two, and check all the students coming into his class are who they say they are?"

"An excellent idea." Dumbledore said brightly. "I'd give you points but alas you're not in the House system."

"Thank Merlin." Snape muttered under his breath before he cleared his throat and raised his voice. "It has merit as a plan but we would need to cover more than one subject at NEWT level as not all sixth and seventh years take one particular class."

"Are we sure there isn't a way to fool the map?" Moody asked gruffly.

Sirius considered the question for a long moment before he shook his head. "I don't think so but Remus would be the best person to ask. He did a lot of the charms work."

"So, we do a spot check with the map this week," Moody said, "and in the meantime, the Director and the Headmaster will approach the Board and the parents to get permission for a full blood check."

Both Dumbledore and Amelia grimaced.

"Sounds like a plan." Sirius said. "We'll get the map to you for tomorrow morning."

"You best get yourself back to HQ, lass." Moody pointed at Amelia. "Nothing more for you to do here."

Amelia nodded. "I'll be in touch if there's anything else." She walked away towards the British aurors and Harry glanced back at the ship.

He shivered.

"Let's get back inside." Sirius suggested, his hand clasping Harry's shoulder comfortingly. "There's nothing to be done here."

They all fell into step with each other as they walked back towards Hogwarts.

"Hey, Harry," Ron broke the silence as they passed the Quidditch pitch, "can you spend some time with Ginny on some seeker moves?"

Harry nodded. Ginny was doing a lot better at being a friend rather than a stalker and, besides, he really wanted Gryffindor to win the cup. They'd managed to win their second match against Hufflepuff and they were facing Slytherin in the last match of the year. It would decide the cup since Slytherin had also managed wins against the other teams.

"I wish you could play." Ron complained. "Ginny's alright but she's no you, and Malfoy's improved a lot this year."

Harry was warmed by the offhand praise and comforted to know he would be welcomed back to the team.

"I've been telling him that for weeks." Hermione complained lightly without any anger or irritation in her tone. She grinned and winked at Harry who stuck his tongue out at her.

"Hot chocolate, I think." Sirius said as they made it inside.

"And biscuits?" asked Ron hopefully.

"You just had some!" protested Hermione.

"I'm a growing lad!" Ron retorted.

Harry chuckled, exchanging an amused glance with Sirius.

Maybe there was someone already in the castle waiting to strike; maybe Voldemort had shown his ruthlessness in killing Karkaroff; maybe there was still a trial and a final task to be faced…but it didn't matter.

With the familiar camaraderie of his best friends filling him to the brim as he listened to their usual bickering, and with Sirius's steady presence at his back, Harry knew he wasn't alone.
