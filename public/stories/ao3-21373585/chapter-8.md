***...~AMP~...***

"Wh-...What?"

"C'mon, what did they say?"

Izuku paused as he contemplated his next move, "...They talked about you girls, like I said."

"I know. I mean, what exactly did they say? Specifics?"

"Uh, why d-do you want to know?" 

Now Kyouka was really suspicious. Izuku wouldn't be dodging the question if it wasn't a big deal.

"Izuku, what happened?" He remained silent, looking around for anything to distract them from the conversation. "Izuku...what did they say about me?"

It had to be about her. Izuku may not be a liar, but that didn't mean he would tell people things they likely didn't want to hear. He had told the truth, just not the specifics. Kyouka knew herself that knowing the answer was going to hurt. *Badly.* It was too late. She had to know.

Izuku sighed and looked to his feet, "...I can't."

"Can't or won't?"

"Both. Even if I could, I refuse to have those words come out of my mouth.

...That bad?

Kyouka nodded, "Okay, I understand." Izuku sighed in relief, grateful that the topic was finally drop— "I'll just ask them."

"What?! Kyouka, it's—" Izuku's eyes widened, realizing she was already walking over to Kaminari on the other side of the room. Izuku quickly rushed over and grabbed her, spinning her around and pushing her to the back of the room and away from everyone else. "Kyouka, please just listen. It's just...it was stupid. It was all just really idiotic guy-talk stuff. None of it was true."

"So if none of it was true, then why are you so worried? It should be fine. You know that dumb saying. Sticks and stones may break my bones-"

"But words can hurt like hell, and you know it."

Kyouka sighed, hands on Izuku's shoulders, "Izuku... please."

His mouth opened and closed repeatedly, no words coming out. He eventually looked back down at his feet, shaking his head. All Might turned around from the monitor and spoke to the class. **"Team G and Team C are up next!"** 

Kyouka began to back away, Izuku still not meeting her eyes. She turned around to see Kaminari waiting for her by the exit. *'Alright Pikachu, you have some answers for me.'*

***...~AMP~...***

"You got 'em yet?" Kaminari asked, leaning next to Kyouka as she jammed her jack into the wall and adjusted the volume on her headphones. 

"Gimme a second." Kyouka already knew that Momo and Minoru were directly above them. She just needed time to ask Denki some questions. Kyouka reached under her headphones and took out her earpiece, shutting it down and cutting off All Might from listening in. "Hey, turn off your earpiece for a minute. I can hear it's feedback."

"Oh, sorry." He quickly informed All Might of what he was doing and turned off his device, only to look up and see Kyouka looking him dead in the eye. "U-Uh...What?"

"What did you say at lunch yesterday?"

Denki's eyes widened, "I-I don-"

"What. Did. You. Say? You were clearly nervous when you asked about it, and you were scared that Izuku might've told me. Apparently, it was bad enough where he won't say it."

Denki began to back away, "I-I really don't know what you're talking about. Like he said, we were just talking about girls. You know, locker room talk?"

"If you haven't noticed, dipshit, I am a girl. So, that includes me. I already know you said something about me, I just don't know what. And, it's really beginning to piss me off. When I get pissed off, Izuku gets concerned. He's a pretty protective person, and I'm sure you saw what he did to that softball yesterday. Did you also know that in his entrance exam he destroyed the Zero-Pointer bot in a single punch?"

"Alright! I get it! I...Look, Jirou, it wasn't me. It was Mineta. He's a nice guy, but he says a lot of stupid crap. It wasn't-"

"Serious? Then what's the problem with telling me?"

Denki ran a hand through his hair and took a deep breath, "Do you really want to know?" Kyouka nodded, even though her mind was telling her it was just going to hurt. "...He said-"

***...~AIV~...***

**(Observation Room)**

Ochako tilted her head at the television, "What are they doing? They're just talking?"

Tenya nodded, "Perhaps strategizing."

"Hmm...I don't know. Denki looks kinda nervous. What do you think, Midoriya?"

"..."

"Midoriya?" Izuku still didn't answer. He was completely focused on the screen, anxiety etched into his features. He knew what they were talking about. He knew what Kyouka had asked Denki. Izuku watched her expression, waiting for his cue to...he didn't know. Just do something.

But, there was nothing. 

With every word out of Denki's mouth, Kyouka just stared at him completely frozen with her glare on her face. Kaminari finally stopped talking and waited for Kyouka to respond. She simply sat there for what seemed like forever, completely unmoving. Without another word Kyouka punched the wall, her speakers firing soundwaves into the concrete. Denki flinched back, and everyone in the observation room watched in confusion. The wall cracked and shattered, traveling up and reaching the ceiling. The ceiling broke apart and gave out. 

Momo, Mineta, and the bomb all fell down to the level below them. Kyouka stomped across the rubble, slammed her hand on the bomb, turned around, and stormed out of the room and out the building. Everyone watched in complete shock at how quickly and easily Kyouka had won.

All Might looked around, not exactly knowing what to say. **"Um...Uh...the hero team wins?"**

Ochako's mouth was open as she stared in awe, "Jirou's amazing. She did that all by herself. But...what do you think happened in there?"

The door suddenly swung open with Kyouka walking through. Izuku immediately tried to go to her, but she veered off towards All Might. "I don't feel good. Can I go to the nurse's office?"

Her behavior and tone made it clear to All Might that it was likely a bad idea to deny her request. **"Alright, go on. I hope you feel better."**

Kyouka began to walk out of the room, but not before Izuku tried to stop her. "Kyouka, wait I-"

She dodged to the left, avoiding Izuku. Just as she moved past him she gripped Izuku's hand and gave it a squeeze as reassurance, to show that she didn't blame him. Only then did she take her leave. Izuku gazed at the door she had left out of. He looked back and forth between All Might and the door as he contemplated on whether to go after her or stay. Did she want to be left alone? Would he get in trouble for going?

...Okay, he kind of didn't care about the second worry. She was his priority.

But, it was clear that she didn't want Izuku getting in her way. He had never actually dealt with an emotionally hurt Kyouka, so he had no idea how to handle the situation.

**"Young Midoriya?"** Izuku turned to All Might, who was sending out the next team. **"You're essentially done here. You can go check on her if you'd like."**

"Oh! Thank you, All Might!" He turned around to leave, but the other side door opened to reveal Kaminari, Momo, and Mineta returning from the test. Denki caught Izuku's eye and immediately grew nervous.

Izuku turned away and began to leave. Denki rushed over to him and grabbed his shoulder, "Wait, dude. I'm so sorr-"

"Don't worry about it. You're fine." Izuku shook off his hand and walked out the door. He knew it honestly wasn't Kaminari's fault, and he wasn't particularly angry with him as much as he was angry at Mineta. But, Izuku honestly just wasn't in the mood to talk to anyone involved in the matter. He would apologize to Denki later. Kyouka required immediate attention. Izuku lightly jogged down the halls in an attempt to catch up to Kyouka, but he never caught sight of her. Finally, he was met with Recovery Girl's office. Izuku opened the door and found no one except for the old nurse herself. "Oh boy. What'd you do this time?"

Izuku shook his head, "It's not me. Kyouka Jirou came down here. You know, the girl that was with me during the entrance exam?"

"Oh, her? I'm sorry, but I haven't seen her. She's not been in here."

"She left." Both turned to the doorway to see Aizawa standing there. "Jirou came to me and asked to go home early. She clearly wasn't in the right mental state to stay too much longer, so I let her go. However, she refused to tell me what had happened. She told me you'd be here, Midoriya. Did she leave because of you?"

"N-No, it's...it's complicated...and sort of private. It wasn't the battle test, I swear! Kyouka can handle combat, I've trained with her myself an-"

"I figured," Aizawa interrupted. "I've had students who couldn't handle the combat before, and that wasn’t how she was acting."

“I need to go after her! She-”

“Told me to tell you to stay in school.”

“...What?”

“She knew you would come after her and asked me to keep you in school. Wanting to be alone right now, and all that teenage angst stuff.”

“But I-”

Aizawa turned around to leave, “I have no doubt you’ll find her after class. School is almost over anyway. Let her cool off. Besides, she left her uniform and backpack. You need to take that to her.”

Izuku sighed as Shouta left the room, glumly following him out. Maybe leaving Kyouka alone for a bit would be okay. Although, Izuku knew more than anybody that too much time pondering bad things on your own could just make things much worse.

***...~AMP~...***

The final bell rang and Izuku shot out of his seat, quickly rushing for the door. Momo had gotten Kyouka’s uniform from the locker room, and Izuku grabbed Kyouka’s backpack from the back of her seat. With the uniform in her backpack, Izuku quickly raced out the door. Tenya jumped out of his seat, “Midoriya! No running in the halls!”

Correction: Izuku picked up the bag and quickly *speed-walked* out the door.

Soon he was out the front doors. Once on the sidewalk, Izuku immediately took off in a sprint towards the train station. He had a lot of loose ends to tie up tomorrow. Katsuki, Kaminari, having to find some sort of explanation for Uraraka and Iida, decide on if he should protect Mineta from Kyouka.

It was probably more on the lines of *IF* he could protect Mineta from Kyouka.

He couldn’t focus on those at the moment. There was another problem he needed to solve. How the hell was he going to show Kyouka just how wrong Mineta was?

...Well, he did have one idea.

But, it was risky. If it ended well, then everything wouldn’t just be great. It would be even better than before. But, if it went badly…

Izuku just hoped he could come up with a better idea by the time he reached Kyouka’s house.

***...~AMP~...***

**(The Jirou’s Residence)**

He did not.

“Oh this is stupid. This is really stupid, Izuku. You’re going to ruin everything.” Izuku lifted his hand up to knock on the do-

*\*SLAM\**

“What’d you do to her!?!?!” The teen was suddenly dangling by his collar as Kyoutoku had burst through the door and lifted him off of the ground.

“I-I didn’t do anything!”

“Put him down, Kyou.” Izuku looked past the elder Jirou’s shoulder to see Mika walk up behind her husband. “Do you really think he’d do anything to Kyouka?”

“Well...I…” Kyoutoku sighed and dropped Izuku back down on the ground. “No.”

Izuku straightened out his blazer and looked towards the parents with concern. “May I talk to her? Please, I need to speak with her.”

The parents look at one another and then back to Izuku.

“She’s not home. Actually, she never came home. We saw you walking towards the house without her and carrying her bag, so we-” Mika nudged him, “...*I* assumed the worst. You don’t know where she is?”

“No, I…” Izuku furrowed his brow in thought, an idea forming in his mind. “Actually, I think I do.”

He shoved the backpack into Mika’s hands and took off down the street, leaving the confused parents behind. 

***...~AIV~...***

**(Dagobah Municipal Beach Park)**

By the time Izuku’s feet touched the sand, the sun was just barely peeking over the horizon. Just at the edge of the tide was Kyouka. She had never changed out of her hero costume. Her jacket and boots were shed, and her pant legs were rolled up her calves. Izuku wished she would wear the sleeveless peach-colored shirt outside of school, it really worked for her. Izuku removed his blazer and tie, folding them neatly and placing them on the steps with his shoes on top. He rolled up his pants and sleeves, walking out towards her. Her eyes weren’t red and puffy, so she hadn’t been crying. 

Her face still had sadness, but it was the kind of sadness that came from acceptance. A sadness Izuku was all too familiar with, yet was so distant from. 

Izuku sat down next to Kyouka, propping his elbows on his knees. "Hey."

She propped her elbows in her knees as well, and laid her head down on her arms. She looked towards her friend and gave a very small smile. "Hi."

Her voice was quiet, almost like a whisper. "I got your backpack for you. And, your uniform. I left it back at your house."

"Thanks."

“Kyouka...what Mineta said-”

“Stop.” She looked back out at the ocean, “Just stop. I get it. I understand why you didn’t tell me. Ironically, sometimes I’m not very good at listening.”

"Kyouka...I-I-..."

"What? Look, I get you were trying to spare my feelings and all that, but it honestly doesn't help.”  She suddenly stood up and began pacing around in the sand. “You were right, it still...it still hurts. I know I'm supposed to be tough, we're heroes, but I...Do you know how it feels to look at yourself and just feel a pain in your chest. Your gut feels hollow, and you can’t help but want someone else to be staring back at you in the mirror?”

Izuku stood up and nodded, “Yeah, I do. I felt that way every single day for eleven years.”

Kyouka ran a hand through her hair and sighed, “Of course you do. I sometimes forget you were quirkless. Ugh, I’m such a damn baby. You probably think I’m so petty.”

“No! Not at all! I know people say appearance doesn’t matter, and in the grand scheme of things it doesn’t, but it’s something that’s always on your mind. I mean, how we look is going to be a part of our future jobs as heroes. It hurts when people call me plain. It makes me feel…” Kyouka turned to him, awaiting for him to continue as he shuffled his feet in the sand, hands on his hips. “...it makes me feel like I’m quirkless again. At least, in a way. I feel dull, not special, and will never be noticed by anybody. I don’t mean that I want the spotlight on me or anything. I’m fairly certain I’d have a heart attack if I did, but...it just makes me feel like nobody would ever look at me. Nobody would even know I existed. Like being quirkless, it makes me feel like I’m...nothing.”

Kyouka shook her head, “That’s not true.”

Izuku nodded, “I know. I accepted how I look a long time ago, and I know those feelings are nothing but my mind trying to get to me. It has a knack for doing that, and I succumb to it from time-to-time, too."

Kyouka walked closer to him, "Screw that. You're not plain. Uraraka was an idiot for calling you that."

"Well…" Izuku did a double-take, brow furrowed. "Wait, that's why you've been on edge around Uraraka?"

Kyouka pursed her lips, "Not entirely. But, she was still wrong. You're very, *very* handsome. I know my own head is my worst enemy, it's just how Kaminari was so nervous about telling me and me finding out. He didn't want me knowing what they really thought about me and...I guess a part of me couldn't help but feel that was the reason why you didn't tell me either, what you really think of me. I'm just so-"

Kyouka was suddenly grabbed by her shoulders, Izuku bringing her gaze right to his. "Kyouka, I didn’t tell you because it wasn’t true. I was angry at them because they're blind idiots and liars. I was so angry whenever they were talking about who they believed was the most attractive girl in class, because no matter what they said, all I could picture was you. You're the most beautiful girl I've ever seen. I can't even think about you without being amazed by everything about you, and you're on my mind constantly. I used to be scared that I would wake up and realize that my quirk was nothing but a dream. Now I'm terrified that I'll wake up and you were just a dream. You're just so...s-so...unbelievable."

His words echoed throughout her mind. For once, finally she was able to listen to what he said and truly believe it. Kyouka closed her eyes and fell into his embrace, encircling her arms around him and burying her face into the crook of his neck. Izuku could feel hot tears hit his skin, roll down his neck, and seep into his clothes. Silence fell upon them as they stood in the sand, the orange glow of the sunset bathing the landscape and water with its colors, turning the sky purple. The only noise came from the splashing waves of the ocean. Izuku moved his hand in slow circles on her back, and Kyouka moved her arms from his shoulders to his neck. 

Eventually, they began to lift their heads off of each other's shoulders. However, on her move back, Kyouka placed her hand on Izuku's left cheek and planted a long kiss to his right. She could feel Izuku jump ever so slightly, but relaxed near instantly. When her lips disconnected, neither created any more space between them. Kyouka's forehead was pressed against Izuku's cheekbone. She eventually slid her way up until their temples connected, then finally their foreheads.

Kyouka opened her eyes to see Izuku staring right back, not a single ounce of embarrassment or fear in his eyes, but she could hear his heartbeat going a mile a minute. They stayed that way for a while, Kyouka's thumb brushing back and forth as she continued to caress his cheek. Izuku had instinctually tightened his embrace. If he was going to go through with what he originally intended to do, then he couldn't back out. And it didn't look like Kyouka was going to either. Both knew that if there was any time to take a chance, it was then.

They weren't particularly sure who moved first.

If they were being honest, they didn't really care.

All that mattered to them was that one of them had finally closed the space between them, both closing their eyes as their lips softly connected. 

![](https://i.postimg.cc/mgyW0KpS/Beach-Scene-Redo-Colored.jpg)

It was nothing crazy. Their lips simply pressed together, each giving a slight push to kiss back. But to them, it was everything.

Most of the time a first kiss, especially one that truly meant something, was described as if you were feeling fireworks on the inside. To them it wasn't an explosion. It was a fire setting ablaze across their whole body, and spreading to the other person. It felt far more satisfying than fireworks to them. Their lips finally separated, but neither made any attempt to leave the hug. Kyouka placed her head down on Izuku's chest, and he carefully laid his own head on top of her's.

No words were spoken. The teens wanted to mull over and process what had happened.

By the time anyone spoke a word, the sun had fully gone down. "Kyouka...we…"

Izuku was silenced with another kiss to his lips. "Let's just figure it out later."

Izuku nodded and brought her back into the embrace. “I...I just kissed a girl.”

Kyouka laughed, “Yes. Yes you did.”

“I just kissed a girl...and it was amazing.”

“I would say you were ruining the moment, but you nerding out over this is actually kind of fitting.”

Izuku gave a breathy chuckle, “I finally realize now why you were so on edge around Uraraka.”

“And do I have any reason to be worried anymore?”

Izuku shook his head, “You never did.”

“Good.” She wrapped herself tighter around Izuku, his touch and warmth becoming addicting.

"It's late. Do you want to go home?"

Kyouka shook her head against him, "No. You?"

"No, but your parents are probably worried.”

Kyouka sucked in through her teeth, “Oh, right. I’m probably in trouble.”

“You? What about me? I just kissed you. I’m pretty sure your dad considers that a crime worthy of execution.” 

Kyouka took Izuku by the hand, “Not if I have anything to say about it.”

***...~AMP~...***

**(The Jirou’s Residence)**

The duo stood on the sidewalk out in front of Kyouka’s house. Still holding Izuku’s hand, she turned to him, “I’ll face the music alone this time. You should really get home before your mother freaks out.”

“Yeah,” Izuku said, nodding in agreement. “But, Kyouka...are we…you know?”

Kyouka wanted more than anything to say yes, but one thing still terrified her. “What if things don’t work out? What if we’re just riding some emotion high?”

Izuku hated to admit it, but he was afraid of that, too. Both teens still had their concerns about if they could live up to the expectations of their partner in a relationship. Neither could whole-heartedly say that they believed they could please the other on every level. Not to mention if their friendship somehow took damage from it…

Having a friendship was already a new experience to them, but a romance? It was entirely unknown to them and scary. Kyouka had seen tons of couples back in middle school only last for a week at max. She refused for that to be her and Izuku.

“Well...” Izuku said. “...What if we don’t make it official yet?”

Kyouka raised a brow, “Like a test drive?”

“Yeah, like that.”

“So, for now we’re just dating. And, if we feel like things are strong and still growing stronger, then we can make it official? Like, a legitimate, serious relationship?”

Izuku nodded, “And if things really don’t end well, we go right back to the way we were before. If that sounds good to you.”

Kyouka smiled and kissed him again, “That sounds perfect. Don’t tell Mina though...or anybody besides family for that matter. I really don’t feel like getting all that attention at school.”

“I couldn’t agree more.”

“Now you might want to run.” Kyouka turned around to see her parents looking out the window. Kyoutoku’s jaw was hanging wide open, and Mika was smiling at the pair. 

“R-Right!” Izuku immediately turned around and took off down the street. “I’ll see you tomorrow!”

Kyouka watched him disappear down the sidewalk, a smile on her lips, “See you tomorrow, Loverboy.” She turned back to her house, walked up the steps and went through her front door. “Don’t ask questions, Dad don’t do anything stupid, have a good night.”

Kyouka quickly rushed up the stairs before either of them could even respond. Once in her room, she locked the door and sank to the floor. 

That actually happened.

It all actually happened.

Kyouka placed a hand over her heart, its pace just as high as it was on the beach. For the first time in years, she had no negative thoughts. Her entire life felt right. Oh, except for the part where she was scared shitless of fucking up their relationship. She had one shot, and she could NOT screw it up. 

*‘Don’t do any weird or over-the-top shit, Kyouka. Just be what Izuku likes. And somehow he likes you, so just be yourself. Don’t. Mess. It. Up.’*

***...~AMP~...***

“I’m going to mess it up,” Izuku shook his head in panic outside of his apartment. Izuku opened up the door and walked through. He made his way to the living room to find his mother on the couch, “Sorry I’m so late, Mom.”

“It’s alright, Sweetheart. I got your text saying you’d be late. I’m assuming you were with Jirou?” 

“Y-Yeah," Izuku blushed and a goofy smile grew on his face. He then realized it was the perfect opportunity to ask for advice on his personal situation. “...I’ll be back.”

Izuku went into his room and quickly dialed up the number he was looking for. He picked up a letter on his bed and tossed it aside so he could sit down.

*\*Ring...\* \*Rin-\**

*“Hello?”*

“All Might, how do I date girls?”

*“...Wh-...I-...I dunno.”*

“You don’t know?!”

*“I mean not really. I didn’t exactly date a lot of girls. Why are you even asking me this? Shouldn’t this sort of advice be something you should be asking your mother?”*

“I-I guess so.”

*“Look, I am actually glad you called about this. I’ve noticed how you’ve been acting around Young Jirou. Is she alright? After class today I wasn’t so sure.”*

Izuku blushed, “Was I that obvious? Actually, don’t answer that. But, yes, she’s alright now.”

*“Where did this friendship with her come from anyway? From how you act around one another, surely you didn’t first meet yesterday.”* Izuku proceeded to explain how he and Kyouka had first met, and their friendship after that. Something he probably could have mentioned a while ago, but hindsight was always twenty/twenty.*“Two months? How am I only hearing about her now?”*

“I-I was caught up in the moment and I guess I forgot to tell you. She can be very...distracting, in a good way.”

*“Well, at least I understand this all better now. Thank you for keeping One For All’s secret safe. I’m sure it has been difficult trying to keep such a thing from her. We should, however, talk about One For All and what it can mean for a relationship before you actually try to pursue one with Jirou.”*

Izuku’s heart dropped, “U-Uh...I kind of already started my relationship with her.”

*“What?! When?!”*

“About thirty minutes ago.”

*“I-...Well...Congratulations.”*

“Th-Thanks. We’re not official, like boyfriend and girlfriend yet. We’re just going out for now and seeing how it goes for a couple of weeks, not making huge commitments. We don’t want our friendship to be damaged if things don’t pan out like we expect them to.”

*“That’s understandable, but-...”* There was silence for a little bit with Toshinori in thought. *“I’m very happy for you, Young Midoriya. I’ll help you whenever I can, even with the little experience that I have.”*

The teen smiled, “Thank you, All Might.” 

***...~AMP~...***

**(Yagi Residence)**

The call ended after that with Toshinori in a confused state as he gazed out his window and into the night sky. He truly was happy for Midoriya, but the boy still didn’t know the true repercussions of having One For All. Besides, surely the rumblings and rumors Torino had been hearing were fake, right?

All For One never could've survived an injury like that.

...Right.

Something in the pit of Toshinori's stomach, if it was still there, refused to let him be at peace with that assumption. That worry had been in him for six years, no matter how improbable it was that he had lived. He blew that bastards head off himself, but...Something just felt wrong. Even if All For One was dead, and he should be, there's always a good chance he had a back-up plan in mind. The place he had found him in had an extra room, someone else had been there. Whoever it was not only knew of All For One's existence, but was still out there somewhere.

No, he didn’t want to ruin Izuku’s happiness. The young man had just started a relationship with someone he was obviously completely and utterly taken with. While his voice had still been nervous, Izuku’s tone was overall bursting with excitement and bliss. He couldn’t take that from him right when he got it. Toshinori would have to find the right time to tell him and let Izuku decide on what he would do with that information.

He wouldn’t and couldn’t dictate anything about Izuku’s life, especially his love-life. Izuku deserved so much. 

Memories of Nana flash through his mind and what happened to Yori, her husband. The hero shook his head to clear his mind. He would *never* let that happen to Izuku. If All For One, or anyone, even had a single thought about Izuku and Kyouka, he would make sure the villain never had another thought again. He just hoped that whenever he actually did tell Izuku, he wouldn’t be scared out of his relationship with Kyouka. 

Whatever the case, Toshinori just had all the more reason to make sure his student didn't make the same mistakes he did.

***...~AMP~...***

**(The Next Day: Jirou Residence)**

Izuku skipped his way up the front steps of Kyouka’s house. He had woken up that morning in pure delight. He had never-

*\*Slam\** 

“Run!” Izuku was suddenly grabbed by the hand and dragged down the steps by Kyouka. It wasn’t until they were on the sidewalk did Izuku see the dark silhouette of Kyoutoku in the doorway. Soon the house was out of sight, and Kyouka stopped them. “That was close.”

  
“Shouldn’t we explain things to your parents?”

“Not until he calms down. Give it a few days.” She put a hand on Izuku’s chest, “Don’t worry, he doesn’t actually hate you. He’s just directing his emotions of his daughter growing up onto you.”

“...Should that make me feel better?”

“More or less.” Kyouka looked around a little embarrassed before pointing at Izuku's lips. "Um, can I? Or, can we-...uh…" 

"Oh! O-Of course."

 Izuku shakily placed his hands on her hips, and Kyouka put her hands on both sides of his face. She gave a feather-light kiss to his lips before giving a little more force to make it a full kiss. Soon she disconnected, backing away with a blush. “Sorry. Ever since last night I really wanted to do that again.”

Izuku rubbed that back of his head, his own blush dusting his cheeks. “You’re handling this relationship far better than me. I have no idea what to do.”

She took his hand and began walking towards the train station. “I’m just not going to take this for granted. Even if in a few weeks we decide not to do this anymore, I’m going to take advantage of this for as long as I have you."

"That's fine by me." They continued their travel towards the train station in a comfortable silence, each still trying to process what was happening. They eventually sat down on their usual train, awaiting its departure. "So, this whole dating thing. When do you want to have our first date?"

"Well, we don't exactly have busy schedules, being introverted teenagers and all."

"So, tonight?"

"You read my mind. You're going to have to leave and come back to my house though. I'll need time to get ready and look good."

"But, you always look good."

Kyouka looked at Izuku to find complete innocence on his face. It wasn't a deliberate pick-up line. He had just legitimately said that as if it was the most obvious thing in the world. "Is this how it's gonna be from now on? Is everything you say to me going to be an unintentional and charming flirt? Oh, wait. You've already been doing that."

"You're the one that held my hand our first time hanging out. And you took me to your house."

"...Touché."

***...~AMP~...***

They reached U.A and walked inside, but not before letting go of each other's hands. That sort of attention wasn't something they were ready for. Knowing they had each other at all other times was enough. When they eventually reached their class, Izuku noticed two things. Katsuki still had an emptiness in his eyes, and Kaminari was frantically whispering to Mineta.

*“Dude, I think we have a problem.”*

*“What, is Yaoyorozu deciding to get her costume changed?”*

*“Wh-?...No. Look, we may or may not have insulted Midoriya’s girlfriend, the guy who could kill us with his finger, right to his face.”*

Mineta lifted a brow in confusion, *“What are you talking about?”*

*“Remember the first day at lunch when we were talking about the girls, and then you said some not so nice things about Jirou. Midoriya looked freaking pissed! He’s gonna kill us!”*

*"Jirou? I guess everyone has their tastes."*

\**Smack\**

"Ow! What was that fo-!"

Denki covered Mineta's mouth, *"Quiet! And to make matters worse, Jirou made me tell her what you said."*

*"What?! Why are you throwing me under the bus?!"*

*"I'm not going down with you on this one. You're the one who said it! If anyone should be killed it's you! I-"* Denki froze when he saw Kyouka and Izuku standing at the front of the class looking directly at them. "We're dead."

Kyouka nodded towards Katsuki, "You go handle your blonde. I'll handle mine."

She walked over to the duo, and Kaminari stood up straight. "Listen, Jirou, about yesterday. I'm real-"

"Save it, Lightning Dolt. I'm not angry with you. I know you weren't the one who said it and you're sorry."

Denki put a hand on his chest and sighed in relief, "Oh thank goodness."

 "You, however…" Kyouka turned towards Mineta, her jacks suddenly shot out, menacingly hovering right in front of his eyes. "I don't know when. I don't know where. But, I will jab you in your perverted little eyes. Have fun gawking at the girls with these poking through your corneas. So, next time you want to talk perv on someone, just remember…" Kyouka retracted her jacks and turned around. "I'm always listening." 

She walked away to her desk, her heart still a little heavy from his words, but far lighter than she was yesterday. She looked over at Izuku to see his attempt to talk to Bakugou wasn't going very well. "Kacchan, I jus-"

"Shut. The fuck. Up. That capture tape bullshit won't work next time." He stood up and glared at his former victim. "I actually hope you do well in the Sports Festival. That'll be a real fight. You want to fucking compete against me? I see no better time to do it."

He sat back down, glaring forward, signifying that he was back to ignoring him. Izuku sighed and backed away, making his way to Kyouka. She gave him an empathic look, "No luck?"

"You heard him. And, now I know he's not going to talk to me until the festival...which I completely forgot we would have to do."

"Hopefully he'll be disqualified for attempted murder." Izuku hummed in response, still wondering about Bakugou. Even Katsuki's threats were lackluster compared to normal. He carried himself differently. 

His pride was gone.

...Okay, well Katsuki has *way* too much pride and ego for it to ever vanish. It was more like it was damaged. The one-on-one tournament portion of the Sports Festival was a permanent event that took place every year. Izuku just had to hope that Katsuki lost a match before he ever had to fight him.

*'...I'm done for.'*

**(End of the Day: Near Train Station)**

"As much as I agree with your decision to give the presidency to Iida, he seems perfect for it, I still think it would've been nice to be the First Lady of Class 1A." The two were close to the train station, their hands intertwined as they walked.

Izuku couldn't help but laugh, "Both of us in a position of power would likely end in disaster."

"Yeah. At least I managed to get in my first act as First Lady."

"What do you mean?"

"Whenever everyone was panicking I tripped Mineta. Little freak got trampled."

"..."

Kyouka sighed, "Fine, I won't cause him anymore harm...unless he acts perverted again."

"That's fair. But, you do know that First Lady isn't a real position in the student council, right?"

"Well, not anymore." The duo finally reached the station, both separated their hands. For the first time in two months, they were getting on separate trains. "So you'll be at my place at seven?"

"Yeah, I've been planning this out all day. It's nothing formal or anything. I couldn't afford that anyway."

"And I'm assuming you have a backup plan, as usual?"

"Um...dinner and a movie?" 

Cliche, but effective.

"Sure. Better yet, we watch it at my place. My movie selection is pretty nice, if I do say so myself."

"Deal." Kyouka entered her train, Izuku's would be arriving soon. As it left the station, Izuku waved her goodbye even though he would see her in a couple of hours.

Izuku thought back to their first time hanging out as friends and how great it was.

*'I've sort of done this before. Okay... I've got this.'*
