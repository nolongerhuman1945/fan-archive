The world shook as the Master of the Hallows invoked the power of the Elder wand…

a wand that would always cast true for one of Peverell blood…

a wand that would always cast true when it was used in concert with the cloak and the stone…

a wand that would make the impossible happen for its Master even when the spell should not have worked…

Above the graveyard a portal opened…

o-O-o

Neville took another step backward and another as spell after spell hit his shield…

He was aware that further down the corridor Theo and Blaise were fighting against a mass of vampires while Natalie and Fred were going toe-to-toe with mercenaries…

Carrow had targeted him though and Neville was grimly holding his own. He'd landed a couple of good hits – Carrow had a cut across his eye that was bleeding profusely and he'd taken to holding his left side where Neville had caught him with a blasting hex…

That had been when Carrow had gone on the defensive and…

Hogwarts shook, sending them all tumbling…

o-O-o

Remus kept his eyes on the Dementor terrorising Peter and knew what he needed to do; he lifted his wand with a sigh. "EXPECTO PATRONUM!"

The wolf sprang from his wand and charged at the Dementor.

Peter scrambled out of the way…

And the ground beneath Remus heaved, tossing him backwards and…

A hook behind his stomach yanking him…

The world disappeared.

o-O-o

Bill landed a slashing spell to the snake's neck but his heart sank when it was simply absorbed. Magical resistance, he thought absently as he twirled his wand and went for his knife…

Nagini whirled around and lunged…

Caro transformed behind her, wand raised…

And the graveyard disappeared in a swirl of portkey travel…

o-O-o

Sirius dived across the platform as Crouch's Fiendfyre spell targeted him again. The platform burst into flames…

The ground shook beneath his feet as he landed and he tumbled to the grass, Crouch's spell going wild and hitting the stands…

o-O-o

Power slammed into them; raw and emotive and singing of Harry…

Ron grabbed Luna, holding onto each other desperately because they couldn't move or the spell would be broken…

Next to them, Draco and Sue followed their example and frantically held onto each other as they tried to keep their balance…

A bookshelf shifted and George only just managed to throw up a shield as it fell upon him…

And the dragon roared…

o-O-o

Harry landed close enough to Sirius to touch him.

Which was good because it was exactly where he wanted to be.

Sirius's face went slack-jawed with shock before it transformed into a mix of joy, exasperation and determination.

"SHIELD YOU BLOODY MORONS!" Moody's yell barked out at them.

Light sparked in their peripheral vision and they shielded hurriedly.

Crouch stood to the right, glowering at them in mad fury. Voldemort stood the left, a snarl on his newly created face as he fought against the ghosts surrounding him. Beyond them, Moody was duelling with another wizard Harry vaguely recognised – Travers.

But it didn't matter.

They were together.

Harry took a breath. "Ready, Padfoot?"

Sirius smiled dangerously. "Ready, Pronglet."

And they attacked…

o-O-o

Remus reappeared into blazing heat, landing heavily on his back. He gave a startled pained yelp.

In front of him, there was an agonised scream as the Dementor materialised in the middle of the Fiendfyre…

Peter landed a moment after and Remus lifted his wand to yank him down the corridor out of the way of the flames.

Peter stared at him wide-eyed. "You saved me!"

Remus gave a low growl of frustration and grimaced. "As much as I…"

Peter's eyes suddenly went wider and he squealed.

Remus turned just in time to block the vampire's attack. He forcefully pushed the undead creature away from him and lashed out with his wand, a whip of flame erupting to take the head off the vamp.

Remus's heart sank as he gazed at the five vampires at the other end of the corridor. He was outnumbered…

Suddenly there was a presence beside him and Peter stood there. His wand was held in a trembling hand but he was there just as he had been in all of the years of their schooling.

"Like old times, Moony?" Peter said tremulously.

Remus rolled his shoulders and nodded tersely; there was no time to reminisce or regret. "You take the ones on the left, Wormtail."

o-O-o

Neville coughed and climbed to his feet. Whatever had happened the shockwave had thrown them all around…

He grimaced at the sight of Carrow; the dark wizard had been crushed by a suit of armour; a mace had caught the back of Carrow's head, smashing it into a bloody mess.

Neville frowned. He'd lost his wand…his eyes fell to the ground and…

The eldest Weasley materialised right next to Neville – and then a really massive snake right in front of them and –

Hedwig was there, striking at the snake like the bird of prey she was.

A woman appeared, lashing out at the vampire who had gotten hold of Fred…

Neville wished he had a weapon, any weapon; his wand or maybe the sword Harry had used…

And the Sword of Gryffindor was suddenly *there*, a heavy weight of metal in his grasp…

Neville swung as the snake struck out again and the sword cleaved the reptile in two.

o-O-o

"WHO DARES?" The dragon roared.

"You can speak?!" Ron steadied Luna and turned to face the dragon. He cast a horrified look to where George lay crumpled under a large wooden bookcase. He hated that he couldn't leave his position to check on his brother but he knew the spell called for them to remain in place on the Hogwarts' shield. It had been touch and go whether they'd kept their feet with whatever had happened to shake Hogwarts.

The dragon's head swivelled toward them and pinned them with a fierce gaze. "Who wakes me?"

"We really don't have time for introductions!" Ron snapped. "We're in trouble! Harry and our friends and the whole school!" He pointed at his unconscious brother.

"As much as I don't want to agree with Weasley, he's right." Draco asserted. "We need you to do whatever it is you're supposed to do to protect the school."

Sue nodded. "We've been invaded by dark wizards and vampires and…"

"I'm Luna Lovegood." Luna said brightly. "Of Ravenclaw." She looked expectantly at the others.

"I'm Susan Bones." Sue gave in grudgingly. "Of Hufflepuff."

Draco huffed. "Draco Malfoy, Slytherin."

Ron rolled his eyes at the three of them and crossed his arms over his chest. "Ron – Ronald Weasley, Gryffindor. Now can we get on with this?"

"I, little wizard, am Hogwarts." The dragon arched an eyebrow. "Four students have woken me. The need must be great. You are prepared to pay the price?"

"Price?" asked Draco sharply. "Nobody said anything about a price."

"You will be bound to me." Hogwarts stated bluntly.

Ron's mouth went dry and he exchanged uneasy and anxious glances with the other three.

There was a price.

Of course there was a price.

But wouldn't it be worth it? He thought of his father, of Fred, of George. He thought of Percy helping with the evacuation and Charlie at Saint Mungo's; of Bill in the cemetery with Harry; of his mother and sister.

Was there really any other choice?

"When you say bound," Sue said, breaking the silence, "do you mean we can never leave?"

"You may leave," Hogwarts responded, "but you will always feel the bond and the call to come home."

Ron blew out a breath. "Fine. I'm in."

"Me too." Sue confirmed bravely.

"I'll be Head of Ravenclaw one day." Luna said.

They all turned to Draco.

Ron tapped his foot impatiently. "For Merlin's sake, Malfoy! Do you want Harry to win or not?"

Draco grimaced. "Yes, fine. I'm in too."

Hogwarts stood up and flexed her wings. They were iridescent; a startling shimmer of bronze, gold, blue, red, green, silver, black and yellow – the colours of the school, of Hogwarts. "Then so shall it be. Prepare to be tested."

She roared again; a flash of light swept over the room and out…

Ron felt her search his mind and soul; examine his flaws and show him his weaknesses. He resolved to do better; be better.

He felt drained suddenly as though all his energy and his strength were gone. He wobbled, dizzy, and sat down hard. The others followed him to the floor, only Draco managing to make the fall look anything close to graceful.

"I'm jus' goin' to rest a bit now." Ron managed to say before his eyes closed and he knew nothing more.

o-O-o

Bill watched open-mouthed.

Neville almost dropped the sword in shock as the snake fell to the ground.

Bill snapped his mouth shut only to open it again to say something, anything…

Light swamped the corridor, racing from one end to the other…

The snake shrivelled into nothing but husk.

The vampires shrieked, an inhuman sound that chilled Bill to the core; that caused the goose-bumps to rise on his arms and neck…

They fell to dust.

The last of the mercenaries fell to a spell from Caro's wand.

Caro – and Neville recognised the woman with the danger gone – patted Natalie's shoulder on her way over to them. "Alright there, Neville?"

A pale Neville nodded. "I killed the snake." He lifted the sword hesitantly. "I just…I think I dropped my wand."

Blaise grinned at him from further down the corridor. "Just as well you Gryffindors can magic up swords when you need to fight snakes then."

Theo snorted beside him.

"You boys alright?" Caro asked as she started gathering up the snake.

Theo and Blaise both nodded even though they were sporting a variety of scratches and bruises.

Bill looked over to his brother and frowned. Fred was bleeding, his left ear had been torn away, but Natalie looked as though she was tending it well enough. The Head Girl was administering basic first aid.

Fred grimaced. "George is going to kill me." He grumbled. "Mum'll be able to tell us apart now."

Bill grinned and shook his head. He noted Neville had put the sword aside and was searching for his wand, casting worried glances at the floor. Bill raised his wand to summon Neville's…

"BILL!" Fred's frantic yell had Bill turning…

Carrow was lifting Neville's wand, a vicious grin on his bloody face...

The purple flame shot out towards Bill…

There was no time to shield…

Suddenly a form shot into the space between him and the spell…

Caro met Bill's eyes.

The spell hit her full force.

Bill retaliated with a severing charm that took Carrow's head from his shoulders. He shifted to catch Caro as she fell…

Caro slumped against him. "Worth it." She whispered. Her hand lifted weakly and touched his cheek.

Bill gently lowered her to the ground, keeping hold of her in his arms, dimly aware of the shocked silence around him. He ran a diagnostic spell and felt his breath catch in his throat.

She was already gone.

He gave a sob and lowered his head to hers.

She'd saved him and she was gone.

o-O-o

Remus panted for breath and spun to avoid the flames biting at his ankles as the vamp in front of him fell to dust…

Light appeared out of nowhere, suffocating the fire into nothingness.

It swamped him. Pins and needles erupted all over his body before the light moved on leaving him a shaking mess in the middle of the corridor.

He watched as it moved away, eliminating the remaining vampire who had managed to corner Peter.

Peter struggled to his feet. "It's over?"

"The defences have been activated." Remus said. That was a relief. It meant the kids must have made it to the office and were safe.

Peter nodded hesitantly, nervously. "What now, Moony? I…" he gave a cry and his silver hand suddenly struck out, aiming for his own throat…

Remus immediately cast a cutting charm across the corridor.

The silver hand fell to the floor but it leapt again for Peter…

A smelting charm saw it turn to slag.

Remus hurried over to where Peter had collapsed against the wall. He was whimpering with pain, holding his bleeding limb. Remus cast a couple of spells to stop the bleeding, to start healing.

He grimaced as he sat back.

Peter had passed out.

He added a sleeping charm for good measure; wrapped Peter in tightly bound ropes; cast a hex that would prevent Peter from assuming his animagus form.

"REMUS!" Arthur's call from the end of the corridor had Remus turning to the harried father with alacrity.

"Arthur."

"What's happened?" demanded a bloodied Arthur as he hurried over, Flitwick and a group of werewolves just behind him.

"I don't know." Remus admitted. "One minute we were in the cemetery and then we were here." He glanced around him. "The defences are up."

"Yes." Arthur said and Remus saw the vast relief that his children were safe written all over Arthur's face.

Remus patted his shoulder and looked past him. "Gregor."

"Remus." Gregor beamed at him. "It appears you have caught a rat."

Remus nodded. "I need someone to watch him or get him to the infirmary – both." He shook himself. "I have to find Harry."

Flitwick brandished the map. "He's on the Quidditch pitch with Riddle. Moody, Sirius, Dennis Travers and Crouch Junior are there too, and oh – Director Bones and the Rat Squad are fighting the Death Eaters. We should join them and help."

Remus gave a nod of thanks. "Then…"

"Go." Gregor agreed, gesturing for him to move. "My pack will watch your rat. Go help *your* pack, Remus."

Remus didn't wait; he ran.

o-O-o

Breathing had become something of a luxury but Albus didn't let the shortness of breath stop him as he turned to face the latest wave of Dementors; to finish off the last wave of vampires.

He would stand between these monsters and Hogwarts for all eternity if he had to…

Light raced out and over him, along the ground to the ward line…

It raced up forming a dome that encased Hogwarts in its protective cage. It glimmered brightly in the dark; a beacon. Tendrils shot out towards the forest; tentacles that chased the retreating vampires and Dementors…

Unholy cries erupted as the light caught up with the dark creatures.

Albus bent double, hands on his knees as he tried to catch his breath. Fawkes landed on his shoulder with a trilling cry of triumph.

It lifted Albus's heart.

Shacklebolt approached him; the auror looked wan and tired. They had all been magically exhausted from the fight. "Do you know what this is, Headmaster?"

"Hogwarts." Albus said with satisfaction. He could feel the strength of the wards; they were singing; roaring. "She has woken to defend us."

"Can't argue with that." Kingsley muttered, wiping his brow.

Hagrid approached; half of his clothes had been torn from him; he was bleeding from a bad wound to his cheek, one eye badly bruised but he was alive. "Figure we've seen the last of 'em, Headmaster."

"Now," Albus said, gathering his authority around him like a cloak, "we must go and help Harry." He took a step and a sharp pain in his chest arrowed through him. He stopped and gasped, lifting a hand to his sternum.

"Headmaster?" Shacklebolt asked urgently.

Albus waved him and a worried looking Hagrid away. "Just winded. I will be fine momentarily."

Fawkes trilled sadly and Albus lifted a hand to his phoenix to comfort them both.

He did a wandless, silent healing spell and straightened, taking on the mantle of the indestructible elder wizard; the Defeater of Grindlewald. He would stand between the Dark and Hogwarts for as long as he needed.

"Well," he said brightly, "what are we waiting for?"

o-O-o

Sirius ducked under one curse, shielded another and responded with his own barrage of spells. He slid across the grass as Crouch screamed his defiance and shot out a blasting hex.

They were well-matched. They were both bleeding; both were bruised. Crouch was favouring his left leg; Sirius's left wrist was painful in a way that spoke of a broken bone.

Crouch was inventive and obsessed with beating Sirius.

Sirius was talented and obsessed with beating Crouch.

Mostly Sirius was obsessed at winning because as soon as Sirius put the rabid dog down, he could help his son. He was desperately keeping his mind on his own fight and not watching Harry.

Or at least he was trying.

Harry was holding his own though. He was inventively using the Hallows; the Elder wand casting true against anything Voldemort could send against Harry; ghosts would appear to distract Voldemort mid-fight; and if things got hairy, Harry would just disappear and reappear in a better position.

But Harry couldn't keep that up forever and it made Sirius even more determined to finish his own fight fast and hard.

Sirius was more used to ignoring Moody; the old auror was still fighting a pedestrian Travers who was proving tenacious. Like a tiny terrier against a snarling Alsatian. Similarly, the sounds of the Rat Squad and Amelia, who were competently taking down the rest of the Death Eaters, were almost nothing more than background noise.

Finally there was an opening as Crouch lost his balance defending against the same liver curse he'd once almost killed Bill with.

Sirius immediately cast the ice spell; cold blue icicles sprang across the ground and underneath Crouch sending him to the ground. Crouch dropped his wand and it slid away across the ice. Sirius banished it immediately leaving Crouch wandless. He raised his wand and fired a stunning spell but Crouch moved.

The mad wizard ducked and dived spell after spell; slipped and slid against the ground before he found his footing and with an inarticulate cry ran for Sirius.

Sirius stepped into the attack and slammed his fist and wand into Crouch's face even as he blocked the knife that Crouch tried to stab him with. His left wrist screamed as it met Crouch's forearm but Sirius ignored it.

He spun and caught hold of Crouch's arm and held onto it as they wrestled for possession and position.

"Why won't you just die?!" snapped Crouch. "Why won't you just die?! You killed Rab! You deserve to die!"

Sirius managed to get the knife away from his skin and pointed at Crouch; their hands were both around the hilt. "Rabastan got what he deserved."

Crouch gave an angry howl and pushed with all his strength, he sent Sirius sprawling. He immediately threw himself after Sirius, the knife came down in a fatal arc…

Sirius kicked out and caught Crouch's hand – the knife went spinning away…

Crouch howled and came at Sirius again, his hands aiming for Sirius's wand. They grappled, rolling around on the ground over and over as they fought; fists landing punches, hands tugging on hair, fingers scratching faces and skin, legs kicking out…

It felt endless before Sirius gave a cry as Crouch pressed hard on Sirius's wrist and snatched the wand from him…

Crouch punched him hard and stumbled backwards, getting to his feet, panting, eyes wild with glee…

Sirius scrambled away and his hand knocked into something; the hilt of the knife…his fingers clamped around the hilt…

"This is for Rab!" Crouch declared with satisfaction. He raised the wand…

Sirius propelled himself off the ground without a sound and thrust the knife into Crouch's belly and up.

The wand fell to the ground.

Crouch's mouth fell open in shock; his eyes wide on Sirius's. They were as close as lovers…faces mere inches apart.

Blood spilled warm over Sirius's fingers as he drove the knife in further.

"Well, who knew you had that in you?" Crouch gasped.

Sirius stepped back and Crouch fell to his knees, hands coming up to futilely flit around the hilt of the knife.

Sirius summoned his wand silently.

Crouch grinned, his teeth bloody and smeared. "This is not the end."

"It is for you." Sirius said. He lifted his wand and cast.

Crouch crumpled to the ground; the piercing charm to his brain killing him instantly.

Sirius wiped the blood from the corner of his mouth and cast a bracing spell on his wrist.

Crouch was dead but the fight was not over.

o-O-o

Hermione repressed the urge to fidget. She wished she had been able to answer one of the questions; her answers filled her head and heart.

"My final question to the final three," Minerva turned to Vivien, "Vivien of the House of Lumiere, the eldest of those gathered, who is Harry?"

Hermione watched as the brown eyes sharpened with fierce intelligence.

"He is Magic." Vivien replied. "Because he is one touched by prophecy and Fate. He is the Raven sent by Death as his Champion; Master of the Hallows; the last of the Peverells and the heir to the legacy of the Lumieres." She smiled softly, fondly. "He is the son of the child I never bore."

Hermione waited impatiently as Morgana nodded at Vivien. Surely it would be her next…

"Ginevra of the House of Weasley, the youngest of witches gathered, who is Harry?"

Ginny blushed red and she glanced at Hermione almost beseechingly. Hermione willed her to answer and answer truly.

Ginny gave a sigh. "He is Magic." She avoided her mother's startled gaze. "Because he is a little girl's dream hero, her storybook prince and her happily-ever-after king. He's the real life hero who saves us from evil snakes and," she glanced again at Hermione who smiled back at her, "trolls; who fights dragons. He stands up for what is right and who never gives up." She smiled almost sadly. "He is the boy I dream about marrying still." Her chin came up at the last; defiant and brave.

Hermione felt a flash of irritation; a young girl's annoyance at another's expressed interest in her boyfriend. But she pushed it aside. Ginny had spoken truthfully and that was all that was important. Petty emotions had no place in securing the blessing for Harry.

And it was finally her turn.

Morgana's weighty gaze settled on her. "Hermione of the House of Black, of the House of Granger, closest to Harry of all those gathered here…"

Her heart jumped at that.

"…who is Harry?"

Hermione's mind raced but she took a deep breath and calmed herself. She touched the necklace she wore. "Harry is Magic." She began. "Because he is the most human of us; flawed and imperfect, reckless and brave; loving and perfect, smart and strong enough to bear every hurt and wound he carries. He loves us so much…he'll stand between us and pain and death." She bit her lip wondering if she'd said enough; if she'd said too much. Maybe there was one thing more to share. "He's my first friend and my first love." Her cheeks heated a touch at the last but they all knew even if she hadn't said it out loud before.

"You have answered truly." Morgana allowed. "You have proven worthy for my blessing. But my blessing can only be bestowed with a sacrifice…"

"Then you shall take me." Vivien asserted strongly. "I have lived my life."

"Peace," Morgana held up her hand before the rest could speak and Hermione pressed her lips together to prevent the offer of her own sacrifice from escaping her anyway, "the sacrifice I seek is not a life; this I promise you." She turned again to Hermione. "You have a token of love which Harry has cherished."

Hermione lifted a hand to her necklace and nodded.

"I have need of it." Morgana said not unkindly.

Hermione didn't hesitate. She could always make Harry another necklace. Her hand lifted to remove it but before she could, magic had the necklace disappearing from her neck and appearing in Morgana's hand.

Morgana traced the rune on the necklace. "I, Morgana of the line of Le Fey, bless thee Harry of the House of Potter, of the House of Black. Thou has challenges ahead and choices to make but you have spirit, heart and shield to fight with honour, love with patience, and choose wisely to protect all."

The necklace flashed gold and silver.

And Hermione felt Privet Drive fade around her…

o-O-o

Harry mentally let the invisibility fade again, becoming visible just behind Voldemort. "Over here, Tom!" He called out brightly.

He was breathing hard; his lungs and chest aching with the need to stop and rest. His body shook faintly; tremors running through his muscles whenever he stopped moving. He hurt everywhere; scratches stung like they'd been rubbed with salt. It had taken a lot of energy to bring them to Hogwarts and Harry was tired.

But the light that appeared a moment before, racing out from the castle and over its grounds had left him with hope in its wake. It kept him on his feet fighting.

Just as the brief glimpses of the fights around him kept him going. Of Amelia exchanging volley after volley with two wizards…

Of Sirius fighting with Crouch…

Moody with Travers…

Voldemort whirled and lashed out with a dark fire curse. Harry sent a perfect ice flame to counter it with the Elder wand. A pain curse was met with a neutraliser; a lightning strike with another that caused a blinding flash across the pitch.

Storm clouds rolled in overhead.

Another blasting hex headed toward him and Harry went invisible. He changed into Snitch momentarily flying away from the explosion and setting down behind Voldemort again, changing back and becoming visible.

"Haven't got me yet, Tom." Harry called out.

"Trickery!" Voldemort shouted angrily. "You should face me like a man!"

"But I'm not." Harry pointed out with ruthless logic. "As everyone keeps reminding me, I'm a teenager. I'm meant to be rebellious and disrespectful." He sent his own blasting hex across the pitch and wasn't surprised when Voldemort batted it away and destroyed half the Hufflepuff stand with it. "What's your excuse?"

Voldemort lifted his wand but instead of sending a spell at Harry, he slashed his wand down to the ground.

Harry frowned and a moment later gave a yell as the ground gave way below him. He changed to Snitch immediately and darted out of the way of another spell. He changed to his wolf form landing and charging Voldemort…

The blunt blow of a piece of wood came out of nowhere and sent him tumbling.

Harry changed back but before he could make himself invisible Voldemort sent another spell towards him…yellow and sickly…

And suddenly Hermione was between him and the spell – it bounced harmlessly off a shield which sparked with silver mere inches from her…

Voldemort's eyes were wide with confusion.

Harry got to his feet and walked to Hermione's side. "Hermione?"

"Hello Harry." Hermione said and offered her hand.

Harry took it. She was real. She was there.

Voldemort lashed out again.

His spell splashed harmlessly against the silver shield; Morgana's blessing was in full force.

o-O-o

Sirius snapped out a containment spell as he ran towards Harry.

Travers toppled over, bound and gagged.

Moody harrumphed. "I had it under control!" But he tossed a portkey at Travers that would take him to the Ministry holding cells.

Amelia had her opponents unconscious and hog-tied; another portkey took them away.

She jogged over and joined them. They slowed as they came up behind Voldemort who was staring down Harry and –

Sirius's mouth dropped open a touch before he snapped it shut. Hermione stood next to Harry; her white robe gleamed brightly in the dark, reflecting the light of the stars and moon; her skin glowed with the touch of another world; of Wiccan magic; strong and true.

Voldemort suddenly swung around as though he sensed their approach and he sent a barrage of spells to keep them at bay.

And in the distance Sirius could see Remus and Arthur; Bill and Neville. They were running from Hogwarts to join them.

o-O-o

"It's over, Tom!" Harry called out.

Hermione watched as Voldemort's eyes darted around and took in the truth of it. Harry's friends and allies were converging on him, surrounding him.

He saw the pitch empty of his followers; Crouch dead. He tried to apparate, to escape and failed. He staggered as he got back to his feet and whirled around, looking for any opening. But Sirius, Amelia and Moody were behind him; Albus, Hagrid and another auror walking up to fill the spaces between them. Hermione glanced behind her and found Arthur and Bill; Neville and Remus.

It was time for the second spell.

Hermione cleared her throat. "The House of Black stands in the stead of Lily of the House of Potter." She said strongly. "Return to us what you have stolen. Return to you what you took for granted; a mother's blood."

Her voice echoed with the voices of the other women. She could hear Narcissa, Andy and Dora; Molly and Minerva. Hermione knew she might be physically present but she was tied in spirit to the ritual, to the heart of the ritual.

She slashed her hand sharply with a cutting curse and the blood fell to the ground. "So have I said; so mote it be."

Voldemort laughed cruelly. "You think that will harm me, mudblood!" He took a step toward her. "I'll peel the skin from your face and…" He doubled over with a harsh cry before another wave of pain sent him to the ground, seizing.

Hermione took a shaky breath and turned to Harry. "Friendship, bravery and…"

"Love." Harry smiled back at her.

She stepped away to stand behind Harry, and fell in beside Neville who welcomed her with another smile of relief.

o-O-o

Voldemort got back to his feet in less time than Harry had anticipated. He wiped the blood from his nose and glowered at Harry. "Parlour tricks."

"Wiccan magic." Harry retorted. "Your blood is your own again. We've taken mine back." And Harry was protected. His body buzzed with his protection; his mother's spell powered by the Potter family magic his father had gifted to her; all wrapped up in their love for their son.

Voldemort paled but he sneered impressively. "Even if you had, it won't stop me from killing you."

"It stopped you once before." Harry pointed out bluntly. "It's over, Tom."

"It will never be over!" Voldemort smiled, evil and cruel. He spread his arms wide. "Kill me today and I will come back again tomorrow!"

Harry shook his head. "No." He said. "You won't." He smiled sadly. "Your horcruxes are all gone."

Voldemort reared back as though Harry had struck him. "You can't…"

"I destroyed the diary when I was twelve." Harry said. "We found the ring you left in the shack. Sirius was able to claim the cup from the Lestrange vault. Bill found the tiara here at Hogwarts. Regulus left his brother the locket." He glanced behind him and Bill nodded. "Your snake is gone."

Voldemort was shaken. Harry could see it in his pallor; in the way his eyes still searched frantically for an escape.

"You're still trying to flee but there's nowhere to run to, Tom." Harry said, ignoring the chilly bite as the wind blew around him. "You're alone. Your followers are captured or dead."

"And you believe you are the one to vanquish me?" Voldemort retorted.

"You believe it." Harry said. "You believed it when you marked me." He lifted a finger and traced over the faint line of his scar. It ached; an echo of pain. "And you're right; I was declared Death's Champion centuries ago. It's time to meet your fate, Tom." He kept his wand down. "Take your best shot."

Voldemort's eyes glittered with hatred; with anger; with fear. But he lifted his wand. "You're just going to stand there and let me kill you?"

"I won't die." Harry smiled confidently. "I'm protected with the one power you have never understood, Tom."

"But they are not." Voldemort spun, a spell shooting out toward Sirius.

And they all shielded Sirius; every one of them who stood beside him – Albus and Amelia; Moody and Shacklebolt; Hagrid raised his club to block it, and batted it away into the Slytherin stands which burst into flame briefly before crumbling to dust.

"But they are protected." Harry called out as Voldemort realised he was thwarted again. "They stand together." He paused. "They stand with me."

Voldemort turned back to him.

There was silence.

The moment had come.

Fate and Time hung in the balance…the weight of the prophecy between them…

Voldemort raised his wand. "AVADA KEDAVRA!"

The Killing curse flew towards Harry but he could *see* it; the protection he carried slowed it down. He reached out with one outstretched hand and it slowed its flight even more. Harry took a breath and gathered his power; he thought of Sirius, of Hermione, of the House of Black, of his family and his friends…

One final strike…he sent a pure shockwave of magic back at the spell…

It shot back toward its owner…

Voldemort's eyes met Harry's, a strange acceptance simmering in their depths as the green curse hit him.

And in the space between breaths, Voldemort toppled to the ground, dead.

o-O-o

Sirius wasn't truly aware of moving.

One moment he was holding position behind Voldemort watching as his son faced down an evil monster with grace and courage (which would have had Sirius almost bursting with pride if it wasn't for the fact that he'd been so damned worried at the time), and the next he was gathering Harry into his arms and hugging him tightly.

Harry hugged him back just as fiercely.

Sirius pressed a kiss to the side of Harry's head.

Harry was safe.

Harry was safe.

It was a litany that repeated over and over in his head, even as his hands stroked over Harry's back, his fingers through Harry's hair as Sirius held his son and reassured himself that he was real.

"It's really over." Harry whispered, his voice low and so filled with relief it almost broke Sirius's heart.

"It's over." Sirius confirmed, whispering the words back into Harry's ear. "It's over."

Remus cleared his throat but Sirius ignored him. He was dimly aware that others were sending patronus messages; the castle's doors were open and people were converging on their position. He knew he'd have to stop holding Harry soon if for no other reason than to ensure he got medical treatment…he could feel Harry shaking, muscles trembling.

"For Merlin's sake!" Remus exclaimed and suddenly there was a third person in the hug; Remus's arms around them both.

"Oh, why didn't I think of that?" Hermione pressed herself against Harry and Sirius wasn't surprised when Harry shifted to accommodate her immediately, drawing her in so she was sheltered between Harry and himself. She was shaking almost as badly as Harry, Sirius realised.

Sirius managed to free a hand from Harry to clasp Remus's shoulder without looking and squeeze it, silently acknowledging the relief he had that Remus had also made it through the battle.

"Lord Black." Helen Jordan's dry greeting had Sirius finally raising his head. The Healer stood to the side at a respectful distance but she was clearly determined to be heard. "I need to see to Lord Potter and you."

Harry lifted his head and met Sirius's gaze. He nodded his acquiescence. They shifted out of hold. Hermione held onto Harry's hand though as though she couldn't bear to let go. Sirius couldn't blame her, he kept his good hand on Harry's shoulder; it kept him anchored to the reality that Harry was there and had survived.

"We should make our way to the infirmary." Remus said. "I think there are quite a few of us who need to be checked out."

Sirius nodded. He finally looked around properly.

Moody, Albus and Amelia stood in one huddle over the body of Riddle; Pomfrey was there too running the official diagnostic which would certify Voldemort's death. Sirius shuddered delicately. He was all for burning the body, salting the ashes and distributing them to the four corners of the Earth.

Arthur and Bill stood to the side with Neville; waiting to speak to them, Sirius realised. There was a grim air around them that suggested their news wasn't good.

Flitwick and his group had rendezvoused with Shacklebolt; they were directing the aurors, Unspeakables and werewolves into protective patrols. The threat looked as though it was over but they were taking precautions.

"We should probably go." Harry agreed, meeting Sirius's eyes.

Sirius nodded his agreement. "Helen, we'll make our way to the infirmary."

"I'll follow you there." She said.

Harry glanced back at Voldemort and shook himself.

They started back towards Hogwarts.

It was slow progress.

Sirius had an arm slung around Harry who had an arm around Sirius's waist; they may or may not have been leaning on each other. Remus was on Sirius's other side, guarding him. Hermione was holding onto Harry's hand still on his other side and nobody was going to argue about her right to be there.

Arthur, Bill and Neville fell into step beside them.

"Your boys come through alright, Arthur?" asked Sirius gently, casting a glance toward Bill who looked devastated.

"Fred's lost an ear." Bill replied before Arthur could speak. "But he's fine. George and Ron are in the Headmaster's office but we couldn't get in there; it's locked down."

"Molly and Ginny are fine." Hermione rushed to reassure them. "They were both still in the circle when I, um…" she gestured vaguely around her, "got transported here."

Harry turned and gave her a comforting smile before he looked over at Neville. "Nev?"

"Hannah Abbott's been under the thrall of Barty Crouch since the Summer." Neville stated bluntly without preamble.

It brought them all to a stumbling halt.

"What?!" Harry's shock gave way to anger. "She…"

"She betrayed us. My…it was all a lie so Crouch could kidnap me at Yule." Neville confirmed. "Sue knocked her out and tied her up. George has her."

"That's not the only bad news." Arthur said quietly. He looked over at his eldest son.

"Caro died saving my life." Bill gestured at his father.

"And Cedric and Amos Diggory were killed in the first attack." Arthur sighed. "Cedric saved Viktor."

Sirius felt his heart sink and he hugged Harry close. He knew Harry would take the deaths hard. "It sounds as though they all died heroes."

Harry nodded jerkily and Sirius caught the gleam of tears in his eyes.

"HEADMASTER! HEALER JORDAN!" Pomfrey's call echoed across the pitch and they all turned to look at her.

She was bent over the body of Crouch, her wand waving furiously. Sirius wasn't surprised when Helen took off immediately. Albus abandoned Voldemort's corpse to investigate Pomfrey's yell.

Harry looked at him and Sirius shook his head.

"He's definitely dead." Sirius said confidently as they watched Albus and the Healer converge on Crouch's corpse.

"LORD BLACK!" Helen's call sounded frantic.

Sirius was half-tempted to ignore the summons, to keep them walking towards Hogwarts, but his sense of responsibility surged up. He nudged Harry towards the castle. "Go on up to the infirmary. I'll be there in a minute. Moony, go with him."

Harry frowned but Remus slid into place as Sirius stepped out.

Sirius took a couple of steps back towards the pitch when Pomfrey and Helen suddenly sprang back from Crouch – Albus grabbing them as they did and pulling them away urgently…

And Crouch was glowing…

"BOMB!" Pomfrey yelled. "RUN!"

o-O-o

Harry frowned as Sirius began to walk back towards the pitch. But Remus was nudging him firmly in the opposite direction with enough of his werewolf strength that Harry knew it would be futile to challenge it. It wasn't as though he didn't need the infirmary either. He was looking forward to pain relief potions. And a bed. And maybe some of that numbing salve Pomfrey liked to use right across the worst of his scratches…

"BOMB!" Pomfrey's panicked yell brought them all to a stop.

Harry took advantage of Remus's shock to slip his hold.

"RUN!"

For Harry, it seemed liked the world moved into slow motion…

Crouch was glowing with an eerie white light.

Pomfrey and Doctor Jordan were being pulled clear of Crouch by the Headmaster, Fawkes flashing in above them to carry them to safety…

Moody was reaching for something Amelia held out…

Sirius stood between Harry and Crouch…

His father's terror-stricken gaze met Harry's and Harry knew…he knew what Padfoot meant to do…

"*It's an easy choice when it's between you and your kid. I didn't even have to think about it."*

His Dad's words echoed in his head.

And Harry knew this was the challenge Regulus had spoken about; it was the choice his grandfather and Sirius's grandfather had told him he'd face…

The world hovered in the split-second…

Harry felt his heart seize in his chest as Sirius mouthed words of love and turned away to shield them all; to shield Harry…

Harry suddenly *knew* the shield wouldn't be enough; that Sirius's sacrifice wouldn't be enough. The only thing that could stop it was…

There had to be another way…

There had to be some other option.

A third way his Dad had counselled him to find but…*how?*

Crouch burned like a small sun and Harry could sense time ticking away...there was no more time…

Harry dodged away from Remus and went invisible…

In a second he was Snitch and he flew like a bullet across the space, past Sirius, past the afterimage of Fawke's fire as he carried the healers and Albus away…

Harry transformed and went visible as he reached Crouch, landing beside him softly. Crouch was a brilliant white, light streaming from his skin in a continuous glow…

"HARRY!" Sirius's anguished cry ripped through the silence.

Harry met Sirius's gaze, an apology and a plea in his eyes. He raised the Elder wand to the sky…

"FAMILIUS MAGICUS PROTECTUS!"

He called all the magic.

It would take all the magic to save Sirius; to save Hermione and Remus and Neville; to save everyone at Hogwarts and ensure the resulting ripple effect from the explosion didn't destroy magical Britain in its wake…

He needed all the magic to protect his family and his world from Crouch's evil…

And it came.

Gold and silver rained down from the wand and rushed around him like a hurricane, blurring everything beyond Harry and Crouch…

There was a moment of hush; of silence.

Harry swallowed; tears at the back of his throat, stinging his eyes.

His time was up.

The world exploded into white heat.

o-O-o

Sirius coughed and coughed again as he staggered to his feet. He pushed his hair out of his eyes and desperately sought the last place he'd seen Harry – beside Crouch's body…beside the bomb Crouch had made of himself…

Sirius's eyes scanned through the white haze of smoke and fog; he cast a spell to clear it and it parted obediently, revealing…

There was one crumpled figure on the ground; unmoving.

"HARRY!" Sirius ran, slipped and slid and ran…he almost fell to the ground as he reached his son.

Harry wasn't moving; his face was white as milk, marked heavily with the bruises and scratches of his battle. There were rope marks around his wrists and his hands were scratched to ribbons. He was…

Breathing.

Barely.

Harry's chest rose and fell in shallow movements.

Sirius placed a hand on Harry's forehead and watched astounded as Harry's eyes opened slowly to meet his. He gave a thankful sob and clutched at one of Harry's hands, enfolding it into his, holding on tightly. He wasn't going to let go. He wasn't going to let go ever again.

Others were approaching – running to them; frantic calls and cries that Sirius ignored to keep his eyes on his son. He kissed Harry's knuckles; cupped his cheek softly.

Harry coughed weakly. "Padfoot…"

"Don't try to speak." Sirius soothed him. "It's going to be alright, Pronglet."

Remus slid to a halt beside him, kneeling and examining Harry with frantic amber eyes. Hermione was a heartbeat behind him; her face drenched with tears at the sight of Harry. She turned and buried her head in a devastated Neville's shoulder.

Behind them, the children who had defended Hogwarts arrived; faces anxious and horrified. Ron immediately moved to help Neville comfort Hermione. The rest of the Weasleys moved to surround them. Albus hovered beside Draco; Moody and Amelia beside him. Hagrid was a looming presence; a bulwark against the rest coming closer.

"Let us through!"

Helen and Pomfrey were suddenly beside him, casting wands in frantic diagnostics.

"He's alive but…he needs immediate medical attention. The damage to his internal organs is extensive." Helen said briskly.

"More help than we can give him here." Pomfrey said.

"We can take him to the Valley." Helen pulled her necklace free of her clothing. The portkey to her home; to their salvation.

Sirius nodded, unable to speak. He swallowed hard on the lump of emotion that had settled in his throat. "Anything." He said roughly.

The air chilled suddenly though.

Helen frowned as the portkey didn't work. "What…"

And everything around them froze.

Mist surrounded them, cutting them off from Hogwarts, from the sight of the destruction of the Quidditch pitch; from the world that existed beyond them…

Albus lifted his wand as a figure emerged. "Who goes there?"

It was a wizard; old fashioned open robes covered his arms and fell to the ground in a sweep of material; rough leather trousers rode low on his hips; his chest was bare; a hank of his hair was braided to the side of his head, the rest fell in a dark sweep to his shoulders. His body shimmered with magic, sparking gold and silver.

"Merlin." Remus breathed the name reverently.

Sirius shifted, placing more of his body between Harry and the spirit. "No." He said forcefully. "No, you can't take him!"

Merlin smiled sympathetically but his eyes were resolute. "There is a sacrifice to be borne for the magic."

"And so you seek my Champion, Emrys." Another figure emerged on the other side of Harry and everyone stumbled back to give him a wide berth.

The black cloak shrouded the figure but Sirius could take a guess at who it was. "Death."

Merlin bowed his head. Sirius wasn't surprised when the others followed suit.

"You can't take Harry." Sirius simply reiterated. "He just…he needs medical care. He's alive and…" he stopped abruptly aware he was babbling. "If there is to be a sacrifice, take me."

"Yet he lives only because he is tethered to you, my Grim." Death interjected firmly but kindly.

Sirius's eyes widened. "I don't…I don't understand…"

Death waved at Harry. "The Master of the Hallows. He tied your life to his in the cemetery on the eve of the New Year. A child's wish for his father never to leave him. And you never will. Your heart will beat with his until he undoes what was done."

It was astounding and shocking and Sirius was more than content with it. It made perfect sense to him that his life would only last the length of Harry's because how could he live for one more moment after Harry was gone from him. He wouldn't.

"Sorry." Harry's rough whisper dragged Sirius's attention to Harry.

Harry looked up at him with eyes filled with guilty regret.

"Hush." Sirius smoothed Harry's fringe away from his forehead. "I'm not…you are my life, Harry."

"But I…I used the Hallows." Harry argued weakly. "I can't…"

"Peace, my Raven." Death spoke, drawing their attention. "You are my Champion and all you did was make a magical reality of what already *is*."

"And Harry is tethered to life while Sirius lives." Remus said out loud. "That's why the family magic hasn't already taken his life as its sacrificial due?"

Merlin tilted his head. "Yes." He looked over at Sirius and Harry. "But a sacrifice is due."

"A choice then." Harry croaked.

"There is no choice." Sirius said gently. "You can undo the tether and I'll…"

Harry's hand tightened on his almost painfully. "No!" His eyes filled with pain and tears as he struggled to sit up. "I can't lose you and…" he gasped.

Sirius hushed him again, easing him down and gathering him into his arms. Harry pressed into him, his cold face against Sirius's neck.

"Dad…" Harry whispered roughly, "Dad said there'd be a third way."

"Then we'll find it." Sirius promised, kissing Harry's forehead. "We'll find it."

"How?" hissed Remus beside him. "The family magic can only be called by the most powerful in a generation, one considered a guardian for all. Sirius, you are arguably that for our generation and Harry…Harry is in a league of his own in his."

"Then perhaps I might be able to offer a solution?" Albus stepped forward. He smiled sadly as they all turned to look at him. "I believe I am the most powerful of *my* generation."

"Albus…" Sirius began but stopped unsure what he could say. He had no words.

Merlin gazed at Albus for a long moment. "If Harry accepts the sacrifice…"

Sirius brushed a hand over Harry's hair. "Harry?"

Confusion was written over Harry's pale face as he looked at Albus. "Why?"

"I made many mistakes with you, Harry. Through my own arrogance and stubbornness, I kept you from your godfather and I kept him from you through inaction and negligence to my duty as his leader and as Chief Warlock. I consigned him to a hellish torture and you to an unloving home because I thought your safety was more important and I was wrong. I should have found another way." Albus shook his head. "Now, there is another way and I have a…a chance to redeem myself. I can give you your godfather and I can give him you."

"But you'll die." Harry pointed out plaintively and Sirius fought the urge to push, to tell him to say yes and take Albus's offer, because his argument wasn't wrong.

"I am ready for my next great adventure." Albus said softly. His hand touched his chest for a moment. "My time is ending and yours is just beginning. Let me do this for you, Harry."

Sirius felt the sob that Harry refused to give voice to; the catch and shudder of Harry's body as he fought his emotions.

Harry gave a quick nod. "Thank you."

It was barely audible.

Death held out his hand. "Come to me then, Albus of the line of Dumbledore. Your family awaits you."

Albus nodded. Fawkes trilled sadly as Albus petted him one last time. "You'll stay with Hagrid now until Harry is of age. He'll take care of you."

Hagrid was openly weeping but he held out his arm and the phoenix flew to him.

"Alastor…" Albus smiled at his old friend. "I have a favour to ask of you…"

"I'll look in on Severus." Alastor promised immediately.

"Name the magical Heir to the House of Dumbledore, Albus." Merlin instructed gently.

"I name Harry James Potter my magical heir." Albus announced firmly. He smiled widely at Sirius's frown. "Guard him well, Sirius."

Sirius nodded his agreement, tightening his hold on Harry.

Death gestured and Albus went to his side.

Sirius stared as Death gazed fondly at him and Harry. "I will see you both when you return to me, my Grim, my Raven."

Sirius shivered, the words resonating within him at a visceral level. Harry's hands clutched at him and Sirius wrapped his arms around his son and held him close.

Death and Albus walked away, disappearing into the mist together.

"The sacrifice is satisfied." Merlin said. His spirit dissolved into the shape of a golden hawk and disappeared.

Time resumed. The mists disappeared leaving Albus's body in their wake, a crumpled form a few steps away.

Rain broke over them; pouring down from the sky in sheets.

Harry gave a cry of pain and he slumped, unconscious at last, against Sirius.

"We have to go now!" Helen reached for Sirius and he clasped her hand as the portkey spun them away.

They landed in front of the clinic and there was already footsteps running towards them.

Sirius looked up as Noshi reached them and remembered his words from their first visit, of how Sirius would bring Harry to be healed.

Sirius pressed one more kiss on Harry's head.

It was finally truly over.
