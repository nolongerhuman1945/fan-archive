*\*Beep\**

Toshinori’s desk phone suddenly lit up, *“All Might, you have a call on line one.”*

 He leaned forward and pressed the call button, “I’m a bit busy at the moment.”

 *“It’s Gran Torino, sir. He said it’s important, and that he was to speak to you alone. Um…he also said to answer your cell phone next time, you…I don’t think I can call you that and not be fired.”*

All Might sighed and nodded, “Just one second. We’ll continue this conversation another time, Young Jirou. Besides, I’m sure you want to inform Young Midoriya about all of this. Now, if you’ll excuse me.”

Kyouka nodded, standing up from the chair and leaving the office.

As soon as Kyouka left the office, Toshinori picked up his desk phone and answered, “If you can’t change my mind, I can absolutely guarantee you’ll never change Young Midoriya’s mind.”

Toshinori did his best to hold back a laugh at Torino’s grumbling from the other end of the call. *“I can’t believe you let this happen.”*

All Might scoffed, leaning back in his chair and looking out at the cityscape, “You say that like I have, had, or ever will have control on my pupil’s personal life.”

*“Don’t get smart with me, Toshinori,”* Torino snapped, *“You know what I mean. You didn’t even think to advise the boy against starting a relationship with all the dangers this quirk of his brings?”*

“I, uh…Actually, I encouraged it.”

*“...Excuse me?”*

“He thought the same thing a little over a month ago and planned to break it off with Young Jirou, but I talked him out of it.” Toshinori could practically feel the disappointment and bewilderment entwined into the silence that emanated from the phone. 

*“Need I remind you of what happened to the last person who tried to live in both worlds?”*

Toshinori suddenly sat up straight, his grip on the phone tightening, his voice coming out sternly, “Don’t you dare ever think I need to be reminded of that.” He would never talk to Torino like that, but…the topic was sensitive for both of them. 

*“I…”* Gran Torino sighed, his own bitter tone weakening, *“I know. I’m sorry, it’s just…Nana’s entire life was upheaved at a moment's notice. We still don’t even know what happened to her son, for God's sake. We watched her become devastated in the days leading up to her decision…”*

“And watched her break the days and weeks afterwards…” Toshinori finished for him. “I know…I know.”

*“Then you know everything these two are risking.”*

“I won’t let that happen.”

*“And if you can’t stop it from happening?”*

“Then they will themselves.”

*“They’re just kids, Toshinori.”*

All Might stood up, sitting on the side of his desk and staring up at the ceiling as he responded, “Very powerful kids. Kids with so much potential they don’t even realize it. They have what it takes, they just need time. Time that I hopefully can forgo them from ever having to need, and if I can’t, then I can at least give them more. Hell, and I’ll just say this, we couldn’t get rid of Young Jirou even if we tried. Her immediate response to learning about all of this was to ask how she could help the fight. I couldn’t even find a flicker of doubt in her eyes. Not to mention I’m fairly certain she’s the only thing that somehow has managed to keep Young Izuku in check. His improvement has only doubled with her sudden presence in his life.”

He heard Torino grumble, clearly not convinced, *“If he’s going to handle this quirk, than he shou-”*

“I’m going to stop you right there. At what point did you gain the authority over One For All? Last time I checked, it wasn’t yours. Hell, last time I checked, it’s not even mine anymore.”

*“You can’t sit here and act like my stance on the matter has no validity.”* 

“I’m not saying it doesn’t, it’s just that…” Toshinori pinched the bridge of his nose, trying to find the right words. “...I know you don’t trust Young Midoriya yet, but I do. If he thinks he can handle it, then I believe him entirely. I’m not gonna let him be miserable. I’m not gonna let him end up a grumpy old man in some dingy apartment regretting the past, and I’m not going to let him end up a middle-aged loner who barely has the strength to be a hero anymore. He deserves this.”

*“He’s not going to end up like us because of some girl? Or, he’s not going to end up like us because they’ll both be dead before that happens?”*

Sighing, All Might tapped the desk in thought, trying to come up with some sort of way to convince his former teacher. “...When are you patrolling next?”

*“Hm? The day after tomorrow, sometime in the afternoon. Why?”*

“Where? In town?”

*“No, I’m taking the kid to Hosu. There’s been a rise in criminal activity there lately. Sure, probably from the Hero Killer, but if there’s a chance of him seeing some small-time crime going down, it’s there.”* 

“Perfect. We’ll meet you there.”

*“Excuse me?”*

“Young Jirou and I. I want you to meet her. I mean, how can you make any judgments about their relationship without even seeing it? Besides, it’ll be a nice surprise for them.”

*“You’re kidding me, right? Babysitting two love-drunk teenagers?”*

“Sounds like fun to me. We’ll get there early and wait for you at the train station.”

*“I never agreed to thi-”*

“See you then!”

Toshinori put the phone down, a proud smile on his face. “...He’s gonna kick my ass for that.”

**(Next Morning: Kyouka’s Living Quarters)**

  
  

*\*BZZZT\* \*BZZZT\**

Without opening her eyes, Kyouka reached over to the bedside table and grabbed her phone, putting it to her ear before answering, “I’m gonna have to fix you being a morning person.”

*‘...Why is that bad?’* Izuku asked.

“Because I’m not, and I won’t be subjected to having to wake up early with you in the future.”

Izuku blushed fiercely at the implication, clearing his throat before answering, *“Noted. But, th-this isn't just a good morning call if I'm being honest."*

Kyouka stretched out, placing her phone down on her pillow next to her head. "Okay, what's up?"

*"Well...Uh, wh-where would be the best place to start this? Hm...Okay, I told you about hearing voices, right? Or, at least one. During the Sports Festival."*

"Uh-huh."

*"So, that gives the implication that One For All is...alive or interactive, in some way. Well...I think it heard me again."*

Kyouka perked up, "Heard you?"

*"Yeah, l-like how I asked for help during the Festival. I said I wanted to know more about All Might's master last night. And, I might have gotten flashes of...well, I'm not sure. But, it seemed like memories; her memories."*

“You can see the memories of the past users? What the hell is this freaking quirk?”

*“I-I can’t confirm what I saw, like I said, they were just flashes. All of them were just small glimpses for a couple seconds, but definitely not like any dream I’ve ever had. I know I heard her say All Might’s name, too.”*

“Do you think they might have been All Might’s memories?”

*“I don’t think so. There was another one flash where she sounded really…sad. Like she was crying. She apologized to someone named Kotarou.”*

“Have you heard that name before?”

*“I don’t even know All Might’s master’s name, much less anyone related to her.”*

Kyouka sat up against the headboard, “Well, at least now you have even more reason to ask about her and they won’t be able to avoid the question. But…do you think One For All is trying to tell you something about…well…us.”

She could hear Izuku sigh on the other end, *“Its timing is a bit too spot on to be coincidence. Let’s just hope she’s on our side and not Gran Torino’s.”*   

“Memories of a tearful apology to someone doesn’t exactly give me hope.”

Izuku rubbed his temples with a groan, *“Me neither. I’ll see what Gran Torino can tell me.”*

“If you want I’ll ask All Might, too. Maybe they’ll tell us different things.”

*“That’d be great, actually. You should know all this stuff, too. Oh, I-I can hear Gran Torino moving around in his room. I should go. I don’t want him being any more grumpy than he already is with the idea of me having a girlfriend.”*

“Last I checked, you were ignoring his advice and I wanna talk to my boyfriend.”

Izuku laughed, *“I am, and I’m happy that you do. But, I’d really like to continue to stay on his good sid-...Whatever side I’m on exactly, but it’s definitely better than being on his bad side.”*

“I should teach you to be more punk and break the rules.”

*“...When was the last time you ever broke a rule?”*

“...Uh…”

*“Actually, aren’t punks supposed to be anti-establishment, anti-institution, and anti-status quo? I-I mean, being a Pro Hero is basically being a part of all of those things.”*

“...”

*“...Did I just deconstruct your entire style?”*

“...I’ll talk to you later.”

*\*Click\**

Back at Gran Torino’s apartment, Izuku sat in slight panic. She definitely didn’t take that as Izuku intended. Hell, he didn’t even intend everything. *‘My damn ramblings,’* Izuku cursed himself.  

Now he wondered if Gran Torino would be happy that he might’ve just lost his girlfriend.

  
  

***…~AIV~…***

  
  
  
  
  
  

**(20 Minutes Later: Toshinori’s Office)**

  
  

Toshinori looked down at Kyouka with a raised brow. Her feet were propped up on his desk, she wore all black, including a leather jacket and spiked choker, and had a “cigarette” in her mouth.

“...Is that a candy cigarette?”

Kyouka shifted her eyes to the side, “...Maybe.”

“...What the hell are you doing?”

“Trying to act more punk.”

“Is it working?”

Kyouka sighed and put her feet down, “No.” Kyouka hugged herself, looking away slightly embarrassed, “Sorry.”

Toshinori chuckled, “Identity crisis? I guess you’re around the age where that starts to happen.”

Kyouka shook her head, taking off her jacket and laying it in her lap, “No, nothing like that. It’s just something Izuku said this morning. I don’t even know why I’m thinking about it, it really doesn’t matter.”

All Might hummed to himself, walking around to Kyouka’s side of the desk and leaning against it, “He said something about your liking towards punk?”

Kyouka looked at All Might questioningly. He was really pushing this? “Um, n-no, not exactly. It was just him going off on his ramblings. He just said I don’t really act punk.” 

“You want to be more punk?”

Kyouka waved him off, “No, not really. It’s nothing.” She began picking at her clothes and shifting uncomfortably in her seat, not liking the spotlight being so focused on her and her interests. 

“It doesn’t seem like nothing, Young Jirou. Please, I promise my intentions are only to help you. It’s, well, it’s kinda what I do for a living.”

She looked back up towards All Might, internally berating herself for even trying to explain herself in the first place. But, there was no way out of it. Half-truths would have to do. “I don’t really care about acting punk. It doesn’t really fit me.” Truth. “It just got me thinking about how I look. Ya know, my style and all, how people see me. I was just trying something out. Like I said, not a big deal.” Half-Truth.

“You’re right, it’s not a big deal.” That…was not the answer Kyouka was expecting. “Well, at least it shouldn’t be. Just be whoever the hell you want to be, Young Jirou. How you look is up to you. If you love your style, then you keep it. Hell, it’s obvious Young Izuku likes it, eh,” All Might finished with a wink.

Kyouka deadpanned at him, but a blush dusted her cheeks, “I guess so.”

Toshinori gazed at Kyouka, unconvinced he got through to her. He walked back around to his seat, leaning back and looking up at the ceiling as he spoke, “Did Young Izuku tell you about my past? At least, what he knows of it.”

Kyouka’s eyes widened, not expecting that topic to pop up at all. She remembered Izuku telling her All Might found it to be a very private topic. “Um…Yeah. You mean about the quirk marriage thing, right?”

All Might nodded, “Yep. Did he also tell you what I told him directly afterwards?” Kyouka shook her head, not remembering anything like that. “I told him that while helping and saving others was and still is my main priority, a part of me wanted to be a hero to make something of myself. I didn’t want to be some forgotten kid, never known to exist, unwanted by his own parents. That’s how I thought the world would see me. I didn’t even want the world to know me by my real name. A name given to me by a mother and father who didn’t care. I realized that the only way to change that was to make my own identity. But, I went too far, made a facade. I made All Might, a man who wasn’t even me. Do you understand what I’m getting at?”

Kyouka played with the hem of her shirt as she nodded, “Self-love lesson in a nutshell.”

“Close enough,” Toshinori scoffed, resting his cheek on his hand. “You need to get that in your head now while you can. I was too late. I wanted to be so far away from who I was, I became someone else entirely. I don't even know why I kept my name. Toshinori Yagi? I could've changed it to anything."

Kyouka bit the inside of her cheek, resting further into the cushion, "Maybe as a reminder or something. There's another thing I've learned from Izuku. It's not who gives you the name, or the original intention behind it. It's what you make of it. It's how you present it to the world, not how the world presents it to you."

Toshinori hummed to himself, looking out the window, "If my memory serves me correctly, it's more like Young Midoriya learned that from you. You're the one who changed the meaning behind his name."

"A-Ah, nah. Izuku is-"

"Stop selling yourself short. That's a bad habit you and him share. But, you're right. It's how you yourself make the name. It’s how you present yourself to the world. And, now, it seems to me it’s time you learn that lesson for yourself." 

“I-...” Kyouka was about to retort, but she knew he was right. She basically just answered her own problem about her style with Izuku. “Yeah…I guess.”

Toshinori sipped his morning tea, "Toshinori Yagi doesn't mean anything to anyone. All Might...Now that's my real name. It's the only one that matters."

"It matters to Izuku. And, me. Even I only knew you as Toshinori for a bit."

All Might sighed, "Maybe, but you both still call me All Might. Part of that is due to keeping my real name a secret to the public for privacy and security."

Kyouka lifted a brow, "But, if you didn't have this threat over your head, would you have still kept it secret?"

"...I don't know."

"Well...Maybe you feel that way, because...Okay, you told Izuku that deep down, one of the reasons you became a hero was to make something of yourself, right? To get rid of those feelings of being a tool, of being nothing that your parents made you feel when they left you. Yet, you separated yourself. So...It's not really making something of yourself. You just made something in your likeness, but... It's not *you.* "

Toshinori didn't respond immediately, pondering over what Kyouka had said. That is, until he chuckled, "It's funny, until you two, Torino was the only person who called me Toshinori. And yet...it felt alien to me."

Kyouka nodded as she looked down at her lap. "...Maybe you should change that."

Toshinori drank the rest of his tea, standing up from his desk. "This old dog has too much on his hands to learn new tricks, but...you never know. Alright, go get dressed in something less conspicuous.”

Kyouka scoffed, “What happened to sticking to who I am?”

“I’ve seen you dress casually punk, and looking like you just left a biker gang isn’t it. Today we’re doing civilian patrols, so we need to blend in. Meet me downstairs in about ten minutes.”

Kyouka chuckled before getting up and bowing to him, taking her leave. Once she was gone, Toshinori picked up the tea tray, walking over to the counter to set it down. As he began turning off the lights, he looked over at his desk, his nameplate sitting at the edge. All Might was engraved into the gold, shining bright for all who entered the room to see.

He looked at it for a bit longer before shutting off the main lights, and closing the door.

  
  
  
  
  
  
  

***…~AIV~…***

  
  
  
  
  

**(Gran Torino’s Apartment)**

  
  

Izuku sat in silence with Gran Torino at the kitchen table, his notebook in one hand and coffee in the other. He had spent a good portion of his time writing his hero entry as he talked to Kyouka on the phone the night prior. 

He looked down at it and read it over once more.

  
  

**Hero Name: Deku**

**Real Name: Izuku Midoriya**

*At the time of writing this entry, Izuku Midoriya is merely a student. His journey to professional heroics is still underway, but his improvement is admittedly moving along at a much quicker pace than originally expected.* 

*Deku’s quirk, “Strength Surge” (Note: Ask Kyouka for help later with creating a better fake name for One For All, just in case someone else reads through this…Also, erase this note later), is an interesting one*

*He seems to pull from an inner well of energy in his body that can be called upon in the form of an extreme boost in strength. This well of energy seemingly can also be expanded and grown through physical training, increasing his levels of strength even more. However, as of right now, he cannot handle all of his power. His exponential strength completely destroys his body when used at full power. He has lessened this effect by spreading a small amount of his power evenly throughout his body, named Full Cowl, but using that method with all of his power would prove fatal.* 

*His quirk’s side effects can also be lessened due to physical training and longer exposure to the quirk as it gets used to his body. It is possible to use 100% of his power in specific parts of his body. For instance, he can restrict his power to individual fingers, creating large shockwaves (Maybe research uses for focused air in combat?), but it leaves him vulnerable and lessens his available time in combat.*

*Due to extreme circumstances, Deku underwent what was later learned to be a “Quirk Evolution” (Or Quirk Awakening according to official research sites) that allows him access to the excess power that overflows from his body when using his quirk. His control over this is minimal, only allowing him to burst it from his body rather than any form of direct control.* 

*This, too, also has drawbacks. It cannot be used in quick succession, nor can it be used too many times in a short amount of time. Doing so strains and locks the muscles, rendering him useless in combat, a sad trend of his quirk.*

***Combat Practicality:***     *“D” (At 100%)   /   “A” (Using Full Cowl)*

**Support:** *“B” (Depending on the situation. Mostly wreckage and debris clearing)*

*Side Notes: More combat training is absolutely necessary. The senses are boosted to compensate for the increased physical strength and speed, but that does not mean reaction time is automatically better.* *Perhaps use reflex training techniques used by professional race car drivers to improve reaction time.* *Yaoyorozu and Uraraka should pick up some martial arts from their internships. Asking them for tips could prove useful. I believe Itsuka Kendo of Class 1-B has a martial arts background, but first the improvement of my social skills is required to approach her.* 

*When it comes to combat ability for his Quirk Awakening…*

  
  

And that’s where it ended. Izuku was still figuring out how exactly he was supposed to improve his methods of doing things. 

Gran Torino apparently didn't particularly have any real ideas either, as Izuku was far more complicated than Nana or All Might ever were.

Izuku was really wishing he wasn't such a problem-magnet for himself. 

“Ack! Cold!” Izuku looked up at Gran Torino as the retired pro tried to eat his breakfast of Taiyaki. “You know these things have to be heated up, right?!”

“I-I put it on defrost!”

“Did you cram it all onto one big plate?”

“...Uh…”

“That’s what I thought. The plate won’t spin if the plate’s too big. Only one part of the food gets cooked.”

“S-Sorry, sir.” Izuku watched Torino grumble as he walked back over to his microwave, cold food in hand. “Hehe…”

“Is my suffering funny to you, noobie?”

“N-No! Not at all! I was j-just laughing because it reminded me of how I figured out Full Cowl. Except my comparison was a piano.”

“You have the weirdest analogies for yourself kid.” Torino walked back over to the table. As he sat down, he saw Izuku still reading through his notes again. “Still having trouble?”

Izuku looked up at Torino, shrugging his shoulders, “I-It’s different trying t-to look at myself from the same perspective as I do other heroes. A th-third-person point-of-view makes analysis much easier.” 

Torino flipped through his newspaper with a sigh, “No one knows their own quirk better than themself.”

Izuku bit the inside of his cheek, thinking about how to approach the topic, “W-Well…That’s not exactly true for me, is it?”

Sorahiko raised a brow before folding his paper back up, “In the beginning, yes. But, all of your approaches to One For All have differed from Toshinori. He already didn’t know how to handle you in the first place, but now you’ve added entirely new traits to it.”

“M-Maybe, but…what about the other past users?”

“Sorry to break it to you kid, but in case you haven’t figured it out, they’re all dead.”

“Entirely?”

Torino peered at Izuku, “What are you talking about?”

Izuku closed his notebook, leaning forward in his seat, “L-Last night, Kyouka and I were t-talki-”

“Kyouka?”

“Oh, uh…m-my girlfriend. We w-we’re actually talking about, uh…well, what you suggested I do a-about her and I. And, the topic of why exactly y-you feel that way came up. So, we started talking about A-All Might’s teacher.”

Torino grunt, putting his paper down and shaking his head, “Kid, I’m not exactly in the mood to reminisce about Nana right now.”

“Nana. So, that’s her name.”

Torino looked up, his brow furrowed, “You didn’t even know her name?”

"No, I don't really know anything about her. But…I think she wants me to.”

“Pardon?”

“Wh-When I fell asleep, I had dreams. Or, in actuality, I think th-they were memories. Brief flashes, but…I-I heard her voice. I know it’s her voice, because she spoke to me at the Sports Festival. In the memories, she s-said All Might’s name, Toshinori. Then she asked you a question. A-And, finally, she said a name I don’t recognize. She was c-crying, I think. She was saying sorry to someone named Kotarou.”

Gran Torino sat in silence for a minute. Soon, he sighed and leaned back in his seat. “What do you want to know?”

“...What happened to her?”

  
  
  
  
  
  

***…~AIV~...***

  
  
  
  
  
  

**(Tokyo: Downtown Café)**

  
  

Kyouka watched as Toshinori hacked and coughed on his coffee, doing her best to convey to people passing by that he was okay. They were seated outside, under the awning of the café.

They were on what All Might explained to her as a “Civilian Patrol”. He had said that you cannot be running around in costume 24/7, nor is there always some major villain to fight. Plenty of crime took place down below, on the streets, completely hidden in plain sight. Pickpocketing, drug-running and delivery, a whole wide array of suspicious behavior to look out for, even when not on the clock.

Well, that was what Kyouka was *supposed* to be learning, but then she decided to drop the bomb and told All Might about Izuku’s dreams.

“He-Ack! He what?!”

Kyouka shoved her hands into her jacket pockets, burrowing herself further into Izuku’s jacket to block the early morning chill . She really hoped a girl with purple hair swimming in a green jacket that was clearly intended for a muscular teenage boy was casual enough for civilian patrol.

“He had visions of who we think was your master last night,” Kyouka whispered so passerbys didn’t hear. There wasn’t anyone else in the sitting area, but one couldn’t be too careful.

“Why am *I* seemingly the only user she doesn’t want to talk to!?”

“Izuku is literally the only person to come after you.”

“Still!”

Kyouka shrugged her shoulders exasperatedly, “How am I supposed to know? I’m still trying to grasp the fact that any of this exists.” All Might rubbed his temples, shaking his head back and forth as Kyouka continued. “Izuku thinks she’s trying to tell him something, because last night we were talking about her and how little we know.”

“And I’m assuming you were talking about that because of Torino’s opinion that you two shouldn’t be in a relationship?” Toshinori asked with a sigh.

“Bingo.”

Toshinori nodded as he crossed his arms, “I guess I should've told Young Izuku a long time ago. I intended to, but, uh…”

“Time makes everything numb?”

“I get the feeling you’re going to use my own words against me a lot, aren’t you?”

Kyouka smirked, “I’ll do my best.”

“It also didn’t help that Young Midoriya had just entered a relationship and had just received a quirk, and was scared shitless of both. And my master’s story wouldn’t help him with either of those problems. But, at this point, I guess he’s expressed that he’s more than willing to face both of those fears head on. Exhibit A being the fact that you’re sitting across from me right now. But, to be perfectly honest with you, the story, while not a happy one, isn’t particularly long.”

“Humor me,” Kyouka responded, urging him to continue. “What was her name?”

Toshinori sighed, gulping down the last of his coffee before beginning. “Nana Shimura. It’s really just as simple as Nana was the user before me. We met, she saw something in me, and decided that I would be her successor. She lived a fairly normal life as a hero. She was happily married, had a child that meant the world to her, and found time to be a hero and…well, take care of me. Years go by, everything seems fine, but all of a sudden we don’t hear from her one day. I got worried, but Torino told me to stay put and train. Eventually, we learned that she didn’t show up, because…”

  
  
  
  
  

***…~AIV~…***

  
  
  
  
  

**(Gran Torino’s Apartment)**

  
  

“Her family was murdered, weren’t they?”

Torino grumbled, “You’re half right. Her husband.”

Izuku looked back down at the table, “Oh…What happened to her son? Where is he?”

“I have no idea. Nana was devastated after her husband’s death. But, things kept becoming worse with her mood, nothing shook her out of her grief. I told her to take some time off, and that I would train Toshinori for a while. I said she should focus on her and her son, Kotarou. But, saying that just made things worse.” Torino looked out the window, not with a sad look, but a tired one. “She began to cry after I said that. Then, she told me she couldn’t do that anymore. Of course, I had no idea what she meant until I took her home and saw Kotaro’s room completely empty.”

“W-Wait…Did she…?”

“She gave her son away to a foster family. She did it in secrecy, so that Toshinori and I wouldn’t go looking for him, nor could we give the information away if forced to, whether by means of torture or even lie-detecting quirks. We don’t know who he was given to, or where they live. Nana didn’t even know. She asked for the family’s information to be kept secret from her, so she wouldn’t be tempted to get him back. It was t-”

“To keep him safe,” Izuku finished, a frown on his face. He couldn’t explain it, but something deep down in him felt sad. It was an extremely sad story, so obviously he felt sympathy for Nana’s struggles. But, something else in him felt agonizingly sad. It was a faint feeling, but clearly there.  

“...Yes. To keep him safe. Nana told me that she was going to get the information on where he was kept if All For One was taken down, but…as you already know, things didn’t play out that way. Not long after, Nana died in battle against All For One, sacrificing herself so that Toshinori and I could escape. And that’s about it. I hope you now understand why I’ve been advising against your relationship.”

Izuku nodded, “I-I understand…”

Torino furrowed his brow, squinting at Izuku, “...But, you haven’t changed your mind, have you?”

“...N-No, sir. I haven’t.”

Torino shook his head, glowering in disappointment, “Then, no, you don’t understand. You don’t see just how selfish of a decision this is.”

Izuku breathed in deep, steeling himself against his teacher, “I understand perfectly. I-I know it’s a selfish decision, but it’s mine to make. It’s *Kyouka’s* to make. We’ve m-made it clear multiple times to her that she c-can forget about us and stay away, but she decided to stay and help m-me in whatever way she can. I-I’d…I-I’d be a fool to deny all the help I can get.”

“I don’t see how exactly she helps with your improvement with One For All.”

“Th-That’s not the kind of help I’m referring to, although, she d-definitely has helped me in that department. Wh-What I mean is, Kyouka brings something out in me that I would be dead-to-rights without. I-I don’t expect you to understand, or e-even like it. But…I’m not planning to change my mind. And, if she w-won’t either, well…then that’s that.” The two sat in silence for a little bit longer, neither exactly knowing what to say. Eventually, Izuku stood up, grabbing his notebook. “I-I’d…I’d like to do some independent study today. I f-feel like I’ve already asked enough of you, and I want to solve this issue with my quirk on my own. I think I’m close.”

Gran Torino sighed, but nodded, “I have some old police contacts I need to run by, anyway. I’ll be back to check your progress in a bit.” Sorahiko grabbed his cane, and exited the apartment, prompting Izuku to slump down onto the couch. 

It was barely ten in the morning, and he was already emotionally exhausted. He could tell Torino was, too. Asking to work on his own was probably for the best for both of them. 

Why didn’t he change his mind? His instincts were screaming at him to get as far away from Kyouka as possible. 

Was it selfishness? Yeah, a part of it.

But, there was something else, too. Something inside of him screamed back at his instincts, telling him that things would be okay. It was screaming that they would find a way.

Oddly enough, that voice sounded an awful lot like Kyouka.

**(Tokyo: Downtown Café)**

  
  
  

“I…I can’t even begin to imagine what it would be like to give up my own child.”

Toshinori gazed down, “Me neither. That kind of pain…I saw what it did to Nana in the weeks before and after she did it. It was painful to see her like that, but…still, even after all that, she always tried to smile for me. And, I for her.”

Kyouka rested her head in her hands, “You were all she had after that, huh?”

“She was all *I* had for years. What kind of person would I be if I didn’t try to do the same for her? Nana was…Nana was my mother in everything, but blood. But, blood never mattered to her. It doesn’t matter to me, either. Torino is the only father-figure I’ve ever had, despite how hard he was on me. Even…”

Kyouka tilted her head, “Even what?”

Toshinori scoffed, shaking his head, “It’ll sound ridiculous, but…even Young Midoriya, in the year and a half that I’ve known him, has become family in a way.”

Kyouka chuckled in understanding, “He just kinda worms his way into your heart and refuses to leave, doesn’t he?”

Toshinori laughed along with her, “Yes, he does. And, well, I’ve already expressed how finding a life partner was never a part of the plan, so…he’s like the son I never had.”

Out of nowhere, Kyouka suddenly felt irked by that last sentence. It wasn’t that she thought he was lying, or even that it was a bad thing. It was a great thing! But…Kyouka couldn’t help but find some contradictions in his words, even if he didn’t realize they were there. She felt another bubble of anger inside of her. It was the same bubble she felt last night. 

Kyouka pushed it down, continuing on. “After that, I’m assuming she, uh…”

Toshinori sighed, “Yes, she died. Some time later, Nana died. Afterwards, I moved to America to make my debut and finish my training. I came back, fought All For One again, lost my stomach, and now all my drinks are decaf,” Toshinori finished, raising his coffee cup as an example. “So, have you changed your mind about being a part of this yet?”

“Very funny.” She wasn’t messing around. She meant it. But, Kyouka couldn’t deny that Nana’s story didn’t shake her up a bit. Well, a bit was putting it lightly. She was standing her ground, though. She had more than just a sneaking suspicion as to how Nana died, but she would worry about that later.

“That’s what I thought. You’re a stubborn one, you know that?”

Kyouka leaned back and threw an arm over the back of the chair, “Izuku says it’s a part of my charm.” 

“Pfft, he’s even more stubborn than you.”

“It’s a part of his charm.”

Toshinori laughed, pinching the bridge of his nose, “What the hell am I going to do with you two?”

“I have a feeling we’re going to get that a lot.”

“Alright, enough of that. It’s time we do what we actually came here for. Citizen patrol!”

Kyouka blew a raspberry, looking out at the crowds of people walking by, looking for anything suspicious. “...I’m already bored.”

Toshinori groaned, “Damn it. Me too.”

Kyouka chuckled as she continued to watch people go by, and she couldn’t help but wonder how everyone else’s internships were going.

**(Edgeshot Agency Building: Training Room)**

  
  

“Ow…” Momo groaned from the matted floor. 

“I thought you said you’ve trained before.” 

Momo lifted her head up, looking up at her sparring partner, Itsuka Kendo. “I said I’ve had *some* training. The kind that allows me to defend myself, not the kind where I win sparring matches against someone who’s been doing this since they were little.”

“Well, you know how to use a bo staff. We can spar with that next.” 

Momo quickly raised her hand up in defeat, “I’m quite alright! No need for that!”

Itsuka laughed, extending a hand out for Momo to take. Momo grabbed it, standing back up and brushing her gi off. “I’m just glad I don’t have to fight you in your hero outfit.”

Momo raised a brow, “What’s wrong with my hero outfit?”

“I…Nevermind.”

“Well done, you two!” From the side, Edgeshot approached his newest students. “Great form from both of you. Next time, we’re going to see just how well you can use your quirks, combined with your techniques. Go ahead and take a break for now. We’ll come back in a couple hours.” 

Kendo bowed, and took her leave. But, Momo stayed behind. “Um, Edgeshot, sir?”

“You’re still wondering why I chose you, right?”

Momo’s eyes widened, “How did yo-?”

Edgeshot began counting on his fingers, “You’ve looked uneasy the entire time you’ve been here. Every time you even slightly slip up, I can practically hear the self-beratement in your mind. I literally heard you ask, ‘Why am I here?’ to yourself. Do I need to continue?”

Momo cleared her throat, “No. No, your point has been made. It’s just that, even now I don’t stand a chance against Kendo in our matches. I believe I’m just missing the point.”

Edgeshot leaned back against the wall, crossing his arms, “Well, for starters, have you even stopped to consider that this is only the second day of this internship? I’m not expecting perfection. Hell, I’m not even expecting a *good* performance. What I’m looking for is where to begin. And, self-evaluation from you.”

“Well, I have bee-”

“Ah! Hold that thought! I said self-evaluation. Not self-deprecation. There's a massive difference between the two. A difference I’m not so sure you understand.”

Momo raised a brow, “I know the difference, sir.”

“By definition? Sure. In theory? Maybe. In practice? Um…Well…” He saw Momo sigh and look down at the floor in response. “Okay, look. You wanna know why you’re here? You think your performance wasn’t good enough to warrant you being here? To be perfectly honest with you, you’re right. Under normal circumstances, your performance in the festival isn’t what most heroes would tend to be drawn towards. But, that’s exactly why I picked you. Statistics in a competition don’t equal your potential. And, I saw a girl with a hell of a lot more potential than almost anyone I’ve ever seen. You’ve got more potential than most professional heroes!” He reached out, poking Momo in the forehead, “You’ve just gotta get out of your own damn head, because it’s clearly not doing you any favors. You’re just like that other kid in the festival. The second place winner.”

Momo’s eyes widened, her head tilting in confusion. “Midoriya?”

“I’m sure most didn’t notice. But, anyone with a lot of battle experience can tell that kid is constantly in his own head. You could practically hear all of his thoughts as he processed anything and everything. The difference between you two, is that kid takes failure in stride. Every move he made, every slip up, even when he finally outright lost in the end, he just kept going. He didn’t even bat an eye. He saw it as an opportunity, just another path forward, and then walked away standing tall…I mean, he left on a gurney after passing out, but still. You get my point.” Edgeshot stood up straight, turning to make his leave. “Failure means nothing if you don’t learn from it. Freezing up in a fight means nothing if you don’t try and overcome it. You’re clearly a very smart and talented girl. I know this sounds ironic with your quirk and all, but you can’t overwhelm yourself with options. By the end of this week, you’ll know how to evaluate a situation, immediately see the best course of action, and strike.” 

With that, Edgeshot left the room, leaving Momo to her thoughts.

**(Best Jeanist Agency)**

  
  

“I have to admit…this is a surprise.”

Katsuki looked up from tying his boots to look at Best Jeanist, a brow raised in question. They both sat in the front lobby of the building, ready for a patrol.  “Am I supposed to know what that means, or is this a guessing game?”

Ignoring his attitude, Jeanist continued, “I’m surprised by how you’re acting. To be perfectly honest with you, I’m not a fan of yours.”

Katsuki’s eyes widened, his confusion growing, “But, you chose to draft me.”

“And *you* chose to be here because I’m in the top five heroes. My point is, you’re not the type I usually see. But, that’s not a surprise to me. What’s shocking to me is that I picked you because it’s my job to reform people like you, and yet when you finally arrive you’re oddly subdued.”

“I don’t fucking need to be reformed.”

“Well, sort of subdued. What happened during your last fight?”

“The hell does that matter?”

“Because for the entire festival, I saw an arrogant, rageful young man with a loud mouth. But, somehow, even after winning the Sports Festival, he walks off the field with his hands in his pockets and a scowl on his face. Then, he rejects the first place medal from All Might twice. And, even when you finally accept it, the paparazzi apparently claim you were seen leaving both the coliseum and the school with no medal in sight. Now, you’re here. Still, you’re a rageful young man. But, now your rage is quiet, boiling under the surface. And, your arrogance is now…unsure of itself. You still have an aura of confidence, but it’s almost as if you’re not certain if it should be there. Even the smallest drop of doubt isn’t a part of your code, is it? A strike to your pride, perhaps?”

They simply stared at one another, with Katsuki’s expression unmoving from the beginning. It was true he had only picked Best Jeanist for his ranking. He honestly didn’t give much of a shit about him, ranking or not. But, it was the best offer he received. 

All he wanted was to get the internship over and done with if lectures about his feelings and shit were all he was going to teach him. Katsuki refused to let Deku’s stupid little speech after their fight drag him down. As much as admitting it made Katsuki want to vomit, he had to work constantly if he was to remain above all of the other weaklings in his class, especially Deku. 

“I’m still missing the point of this conversation, or why I need to be reformed. Do I look like a bad guy to you?”

“Hm, well, I’m sure that depends on who you ask.”

Katsuki’s stomach dropped for a split-second, “What do you mean by that?”

“Heroes and villains are two sides of the same coin, and I have a feeling the line between the two, for you, is blurrier than you care to admit. Or, possibly even know.”

Katsuki’s scowl deepend, his brow furrowing in anger. “Are we going to go on patrol? Or are you going to continue to insult me by calling me a villain?” 

“I didn’t call you a villain, but…as you wish.” Jeanist turned around, walking towards the exit with Katsuki in tow. 

On his way out, Katsuki couldn’t help but wonder which side of the coin Izuku thought the blonde fell on. Which led him to wondering just how much the nerd had progressed in only one day of internships.

  
  
  
  

***…~AIV~…***

  
  
  
  
  

**(Gran Torino’s Apartment)**

  
  

Izuku was absolutely stumped.

He paced back and forth across the apartment, reading through his notes over and over again as he tried to think of things he had missed. 

His two goals were to improve his combat prowess without having to resort to using One For All at a percentage above his body’s very small limit, and to figure out how to get better control of his energy. 

Both of which he had no idea what to do about.

Izuku groaned, dragging a hand down his face as he tossed his journal down onto the coffee table. His eyes hurt, and his headache continued to grow as he continued to think about it. He had been reading his notes again and again and again with no results.  He then felt his stomach growl, his eyes shifting towards the kitchen.

Izuku didn’t eat with Torino, because the thought of eating frozen taiyaki for breakfast wasn’t exactly the most appealing to him. But, after looking through Torino’s pantry and fridge, it looked like his options were limited. 

With a sigh, Izuku walked over to the leftover plate of taiyaki, and took it to the microwave. As he was about to put the plate in the microwave, he paused. “Oh, right. I need a smaller plate or it’ll only cook in one spo-...”

Izuku’s eyes widened as he put the plate back on the counter and rushed back over to his journal, reading back over a specific portion of his notes. 

*“It is possible to use 100% of his power in specific parts of his body. For instance, he can restrict his power to individual fingers, creating large shockwaves, but it leaves him vulnerable and lessens his available time in combat.”*

“Well…I guess a step back can be the way forward.” His realization all came from a partially cooked taiyaki? “...Wow, I do have bad analogies for myself.” Izuku placed his journal back down, sliding the coffee table against the couch to get more room. “...Everything has an equal and opposite reaction.” Izuku’s arms began to glow, One For All surging through his veins as green energy crackled against his skin. “Every push has a pushback.”

\*CRACK\*

Izuku fired off his power, the energy striking the far wall…

…And Izuku flew back and hit the opposite wall.

Hitting the wall and falling down to the floor, Izuku looked up and saw a black mark on the wall where One For All had struck. “Yes!” Izuku stood back up, a grin plastered on his face. Step one was complete.

He could now release One For All’s excess power from different parts of his body. The next step was to use it for mobility. He needed more speed, but his body couldn’t handle higher percentages of One For All for more than a minute. Hell, calling seven and eight percent “high” was already pushing it. 

But, if he could get this down, he wouldn’t need to.

Izuku got down into a runner’s position, letting 5% of One For All flow through him, focusing the excess energy towards the back of his body. Izuku took a deep breath, and…

Stood back up, looking towards the wall he just singed, “I should really do this outside.”

  
  
  
  

***…~AIV~…***

  
  
  
  

**(All Might’s Agency Building: Toshinori’s Office. Many Hours Later)**

  
  
  

“Well, that was…”

Toshinori walked over to his bar area, shaking his head, “That was incredibly boring. How the hell does Musutafu have more petty crime than Tokyo?” The two had spent multiple hours out in Tokyo, and it was all for naught. Now, the sun was moving ever closer to the horizon line, the sky turning orange and pink.

“I mean, I can’t say it wasn’t a good trip. I learned a lot. I’m sure all those children and street performers we saw are real gutter-trash criminals.”

Toshinori picked up his tea tray, a deadpan expression on his face. “Ha ha.” 

Kyouka watched as All Might walked back over to the desk with the tea, her head shaking in disbelief. “How much tea do you freaking drink?”

Toshinori set the tray down on the table with an exasperated look, “You’re the first guest I’ve had, in well…ever. All I know about hospitality is giving them a room, food, and refreshments. Do you want tea or not?”

“...Fine,” Kyouka shrugged. 

Toshinori poured two cups, placing one in front of Kyouka as he sat down. “You know, I have to agree. It was a good trip. It’s been a while since I talked about Nana. Sharing her story might not be a happy trip down memory lane, but it’s therapeutic nonetheless. Although, next time let’s focus on my happy memories of her,” he finished with a chuckle.

Kyouka struggled with her next step, but felt it was necessary to quell her curiosity and nerves. “If that’s the case, then I might as well get this question out of the way now. You never said…how did Shimura die? I mean, I have to assume…you know…”

“All For One, yes,” Toshinori replied, resting his head in his hand. “She died saving me from All For One.” 

Kyouka nodded, biting the inside of her cheek, “Was…Was Shimura powerful?”

Toshinori looked at Kyouka curiously, but answered, “Quite powerful, yes. But, with how this quirk works, I’m more powerful than her and Young Midoriya will surpass me. That is, if you were asking out of fear that Young Midoriya won’t be powerful enough if it ever comes to him and All For One coming to blows.”

Kyouka lowered her gaze down to her lap, “Y-Yeah, I guess so.”

“I understand. It’s a legitimate concern. And…” Toshinori sat back in his chair, a hesitant look in his eyes. “...We haven't talked about All For One since yesterday evening, and before then the beach. Any further questions on the matter since then? I’m sure you’ve had a lot of time to think about this further, especially with learning about Nana and all.”

Kyouka scoffed, putting her tea down and sighing as she leaned back into the chair. She looked out of the wide window of Toshinori’s office, the orange sunlight bathing the room. Silence emanated throughout the room until Kyouka finally confessed. “...I’m terrified.”

Toshinori nodded, “That’s the right response. Anyone would be scared of that kind of power.”

“I’m not talking about me. I’m terrified for Izuku. I mean, what the hell is he supposed to do? What am *I* supposed to do? He just got over his feelings of being useless, and now they come to me. He’s supposed to go out there and fight this ungodly powerful megalomaniac alone?”

“Young Jirou, he won’t be alone as long as he has you.”

Kyouka looked back over to Toshinori, leaning forward in her seat with a stern glare. “Be honest with me. Is there any realistic scenario where I can actually be there and fight alongside him? Where I can be there to protect him? Help him defeat All For One?”

Toshinori faltered for a second, “Young Jirou, you’re a strong young woman with so much potential. I’ve already seen the great power you possess, and I know you’ll grow even stronge-”

“I asked a question.” 

The pro closed his mouth, biting the inside of his cheek as he looked down at his lap. “...No. No, I don’t think so.”

“Is there anyone that can?”

“...As of right now? No.”

“If everyone at school and all the pros stood together and fought, what are the chances even half of us survive? What are the chances most of us, besides you and Izuku, survive?”

“...Slim to none.”

Kyouka put her head in her hands, “And I’m supposed to just sit here and accept that. I’m supposed to just sit here and wait for the day Izuku goes out there to fight all by himself.”

All Might put his own tea down, closing his eyes as he leaned back into the cushions. “...I never said it was easy.”

Kyouka hit the table, a scowl forming on her face. “Apparently it was!” 

“Wh-...What are you talking about?”

“You said it yourself. Izuku is like the son you never had. And yet, you gave him the power that’s basically just a death sentence, whether it be All For One or the quirk itself kills him.”

“That wasn’t how I felt at the tim-”

“So a stranger? You’ll happily send a stranger to their death.”

“No, I-...I didn’t exactly know All For One was alive. I had suspicions, but refused to believe it until recently. Please don’t think I put this burden on Young Midoriya lightly. But, he has the heart it takes to be worthy of One For All. He’s willing to carry this weight. The fact that he didn’t think about giving One For All back once I told him, proves he’s the one to wield it.”

“And if he loses?” Toshinori paused, not sure how exactly to respond. “We’ve already seen hints of All For One coming back. What if he comes back too soon and kills you? Or if you just can’t fight anymore. What’s Izuku supposed to do then? If he comes back now, he won’t be ready to fight. No one will be. He might not be ready to fight for years. He’ll die, and I can’t do a damn thing about it. It’s like you said, no matter how strong I get, trying to fight All For One is useless. If anything, I’d be a nuisance to Izuku on the battlefield if I tried to help. Or if anyone tried for that matter.”

“Listen, I...I know you’re mad at me. And I understand why. But, I’ll do everything in my power to make sure Young Midoriya never has to face All For One. And if he does, I’ll make sure he’s ready.”

“How exactly? It’s not like you’re ever around.” Kyouka’s mind was screaming at her to stop talking, but her heart was pushing her forward, telling her to speak her mind because it involved the safety of Izuku, the person she cared about more than anything. “Ever since the entrance exam, Izuku and I have been together every single day. And I’ve never seen you. You’re his mentor, but what exactly have you taught him? I’ve watched him learn everything on his own. You might not think you are, but you really are just sending him to his death. Do you even know how to help him with his new powers? Have you ever even once bothered to ask why he’s so quiet and subdued in class? Do you even know your own successor, who now has ten times the pressure put on him than he did a few months ago, has panic attacks?” 

Toshinori’s face suddenly fell further, his eyes growing concerned, “He…He what?”

…She probably shouldn’t have said that. She wasn’t thinking, it just came out. Hell, Izuku probably would never have said it himself, and it was something Toshinori should know. 

“Izuku…” Kyouka gripped the armrests, biting her lower lip before she continued. “Izuku’s been alone his whole life, and honestly...I have, too, in a lot of ways. You may not think you are, and he might not see it that way either, but you’re continuing to leave him alone. But, I-...I can’t. I *refuse* to let him be alone a second longer. I’ll help him however I can, and when the time comes...I don’t know. I don’t know how I’m going to do it, but I’m going to be there. I’m going to fight with him. We’ll beat All For One, and if we don’t...then at least we didn’t die alone.” Silence rang in the room again, neither one of them saying anything after Kyouka’s outburst. “...I’m sorry, I...I think I’m going to go to my room. Thank you for the tea.” 

The musician quickly got up, speed walking towards the door. “...You have that heart, too, you know?” Kyouka stopped, her hand on the doorknob. “Even after telling you everything, you didn’t hesitate, you didn’t think for a second that you would leave. You immediately wanted to figure out how to help Young Midoriya, fight by his side, even if it’s against one of the greatest threats the world has ever seen. You’ve given me a lot to think about, but...but, even with my shortcomings, I can at least try to teach you one thing. You sell yourself far too short, giving credit to Young Midoriya for all of your success. And I’m not saying he doesn’t influence you, but you influence him just as much. And now I can already see how you will influence me. You’ll see that greatness someday.” 

Kyouka didn’t give a visible response. She opened the door and left. 

Toshinori quickly pulled out his phone and found the person he was looking for. He listened to the phone ring before they finally picked up.

*“A-All Might? I-Is something wrong?”* Izuku answered.

“No, not at all, my boy. Why would you think that?”

*“O-Oh, well…I-I mean, you don’t really call me. I thought maybe something happened.”*

Toshinori’s heart immediately clenched at those words, his disappointment in himself growing by the second. “Right, I jus-...Uh…I just wanted to check in, see how things were going with Gran Torino.”

*“Oh, things are actually going really well…I think. It's a little hard to tell with him, but I personally think I’m doing alright. I think I’ve even come up with a solution for both using too high of percentages for my body, and for my new ability. Gran Torino thinks it’s actually a quirk evolution, which I didn’t even know One For All could do. He also said that I should stop thinking of One For All as anything other than just a quirk, which when you think about it is…”*

Toshinori continued to listen to Izuku ramble on, his thoughts barely able to keep up with his words. He didn’t particularly have any drive to interrupt Izuku. Toshinori was content with just listening to his young pupil talk for as long as he felt like it. Ruining the mood by randomly bringing up secret panic attacks wasn’t the right call.

He would give Kyouka time to herself before trying to make amends. But, he knew a simple apology meant nothing in this situation.

Kyouka had essentially told him that he needed to take action. He needed to be a bigger part of Izuku’s life if he was so intent on his survival. But, that also meant being a part of Kyouka’s life as well. 

He knew what his first step had to be when it came to her. 

  
  
  
  

***…~AIV~…***

  
  
  

**(Gran Torino’s Apartment)**

  
  

Torino continued his trek home, his outing had taken much longer than anticipated. At least he had given Izuku an ample amount of time to practice. “I wonder how the newbie got along without m-”

*\*ZZZT\**

Sorahiko froze at the steps leading to his front door. He slowly looked up, seeing green light emanate from the roof of his building. “Huh…I’ll admit, I wasn’t expecting that.” Torino crouched down, then shot himself high into the air, landing down on the edge of the roof. He found exactly what he had been expecting. Izuku stood panting on the center of the roof, his power flowing around him. “Kid, you look like shit.”

Izuku jumped on the spot, surprised to find Torino watching him. “Oh! S-Sorry, I d-didn’t know you came back. A-And, my appearance, well…I-I might’ve slammed into the building walls a few times while practicing, so that’s why I came up here.”

“Define ‘a few’ walls.” 

“...W-Well…” 

Torino walked over to the side of the rooftop, looking down at the alley below to find multiple cracks and small craters in the bricks below. “Yeah, that’s what I thought. Well, I can’t deny it’s far more refreshing than sparring in my living room. Although, what exactly were you practicing up here?”

Izuku cleared his throat, getting down into a combat ready position, his body glowing with green bio-electricity. “You s-still want demonstrations, right?”

Sorahiko chuckled, getting into his own stance, “Of course. Let’s see just what your little ‘independent study’ resulted in.” 

*\*FWOOSH\**

Without warning, Torino launched himself at Izuku in the blink of an eye. But, to Torino’s surprise, a burst of energy shot out of the right side of Izuku’s body, and the teen rocketed to the left while barely moving a muscle. Izuku dived into a roll, pivoting his body back towards Torino. Izuku’s green energy zapped wildly around his body, leaving a long trail as it followed him. Another blast of power shot from Izuku’s back, sending him careening towards his teacher.

Torino was barely able to twist his body out of Izuku’s reach, landing on a chimney exhaust pipe. “Mind telling me what that was, kid?”

Izuku rolled once more, stopping in a crouched position, “After you left, I finally figured out what I needed to do with my new ability. I was the Taiyaki!”

“Oh…What?” 

“A-Ah, I’m really bad at explaining myself. What I mean is, I-I realized I was releasing my energy as one big blast because I was so focused on using my Full Cowl. So, I focused the extra power to specific points of my body to release. So, I killed two birds with one stone. So, now not only is my excess power released in a more focused and controlled shot, I can use it for massive boosts in speed without having to resort to higher percentages of One For All, lessening the strain on my body. I can also use it for omni-directional movement in air!” Izuku jumped up straight, firing his energy out of the front of his body to send him backwards. It was the same method of midair movement that Katsuki did with his explosions. *‘Once again, I oddly enough have to thank Kacchan for an idea.’* Izuku stood up straight, a smile on his face. “It was just like you said. Every reaction has an equal and opposite reaction. Pushing my power out gives just as strong of a push to my own body, giving me the movement I need.”

Torino scoffed as he shook his head, “I hate it when people do that.”

“Hm? D-Do what, sir?”

Torino’s smile turned devious as air began to flow out of his boots once more, “Impress me.” He flung himself at Izuku again, their sparring match continuing. He truly did have to admit, he was impressed. Almost proud of the kid. 

But, more importantly, he saw something in Izuku he hadn’t seen during the Sports Festival, or during the time he had spent on the internship.

Izuku was proud of himself.

  
  

***…~AIV~…***

  
  
  
  

**(All Might’s Agency Building)**

  
  

The sun had finally vanished from the sky, and the pale moonlight shone brightly over Tokyo. Toshinori had looked everywhere in the building for Kyouka, but couldn’t find her anywhere. It was time for him to truly begin his process of following her advice, but she seemed to be making it even more difficult for him than it was already going to be. Especially since he had been walking around in his hero form looking for her, and his body was getting awfully tired. 

Most of the employees went home, but there were a few stragglers, and Toshinori didn’t want to take any chances. 

He sighed as he stepped into the elevator for what felt like the thousandth time in the last two hours. **“Why the hell did I approve of making this building so damn big? Alright, Toshinori, think. You’ve seen hundreds of films. What’s the most cliché** **place a teenage girl would go to when she’s feeling down?”** 

He then immediately clicked the button for the highest floor. Exiting the elevator, he found the  nearest roof entrance and made his way up. He was immediately hit with cold winds and the sounds of the city echoing into the night. But his sole focus was on the girl sitting down near the edge of the roof. 

Toshinori made his way over to her, putting his hands in his pockets, **“Nice night.”**

“I think I’m tapped out of talking about All For One for the day.” Kyouka immediately responded. “I’m really sorry about how I snapped at you. I was just…I don’t know…”

**“I understand. Believe me, I do. We don’t have to talk about it right now. And, don’t apologize for speaking the truth, Young Jirou. Unfortunately, I’m beginning to learn I’m a bit of a hypocrite when it comes to dolling out harsh realities. But, if you wouldn’t mind, I’d still like to talk to you."** Toshinori waited for a response, but was given nothing but silence. He looked down at his student to find her lost in thought, fidgeting with her clothes, **“...Young Jirou?"**

Kyouka quickly snapped out of it, turning towards All Might. "Oh, crap. Sorry, I was just thinking."

Toshinori furrowed his brow in contemplation before nodding, looking out towards the lights of the city shining brightly against the dark night sky. Toshinori sat next to her, deflating from his hero form. "May I ask you something very personal, Young Jirou?"

"Uh...Sure, I guess. Wait, do you mean Izuku and I's intimacy? Cause I'm not sharing any details about that!"

"No, no not that. But, it is still...uncomfortable."

"...Alright," Kyouka responded hesitantly. After a few moments of All Might preparing for the conversation ahead, he finally spoke.

"...You don't like your body, do you?" Kyouka's heart stopped, her breathing halting, and her eyes widening. She didn't respond, or even look at Toshinori. "It's okay, really. Well, not hating yourself. That's never okay. I mean it's okay, as in I just want to help. At least, the only way I know how."

“Why are you asking me this?”

Toshinori shrugged, “Like I said, I want to help. And…because I was thinking about everything you said in my office. You want to be there for Young Midoriya? You want to help? Well, you need to help yourself first, and…and I think I’ve not been involved in my pupils’ lives long enough. You want me to take action, so that’s exactly what I’m going to do. So, we’ll consider this another lesson.”

"...How did you know?" Kyouka's voice came out hoarse, everything she never wanted to talk about was being brought up by All Might of all people. She expected this conversation maybe sometime down the line with Izuku or her parents. But, this? Now of all times?

Toshinori gave a dry chuckle, lifting up his arms to emphasize how big his suit was on him. "When you look like how I do after my injury, you tend to not like how you look. And, then after a while, you pick up on certain things. Like, for instance, losing yourself in thought while trying to pick at every spot of your clothes until it hides your body the way you want it to. But, it never looks, or feels, right. Getting so worked up over a comment about your style, even when it came from Young Izuku. Someone who can ramble about nothing and everything for minutes without breathing, not to mention someone who adores your look. Listen, I know this makes you uncomfortable, so I'll keep this as short as I can."

Kyouka brought her knees up to her chest, hugging her legs as she tried her best to hide herself. "Just get it over with."

The pro nodded, looking out into the city again. "... I know that no matter what I say, it won't change how you view yourself. The power the dark side of our brains wields over us is mastered by very few. Sometimes, people are strong enough to do it themselves, but those are rare. It's usually other people that help us escape ourselves. Nana saved me once, but...I lost the battle to myself again. But...I was rescued once more, by you know who."

"Hmph...Even when he doesn't realize it, Izuku can't help but save people."

"Very true. That goes for you as well. You're rescuing that boy from a darkness I think you and I don't even know a fraction of yet. He saved me, and he can save you, too."

Kyouka rested her chin on her knees, "Izuku is amazing, he helps a lot...but, at this point I don't think even he can help me with this. He can't change my body."

"Nor should he, nor should you think your body needs changed. Are you even letting him help you?"

"I am, bu-"

"Does he know?" Kyouka went quiet once more, signaling Toshinori to continue. "If he doesn't, then no, you're not letting him help you. He tells you things he doesn't even tell me, or his parents. You're helping him, because you know the roots of the issues he presents to you. You give him nothing, leaving him in the dark trying desperately to help you. He may make you feel better, but he's not saving you. Not yet. You should tell him."

Kyouka bit her lip, a tear sliding down her cheek. "...I can't."

"Because you're afraid? We're all afraid, Young Jirou. Hell, in our conversation about All For One, I asked how you felt. But, I never said how I felt. I. Am. Terrified. Yet, I know what must be done. For the world, for you, for Young Midoriya, everyone. You need to do this for both of you. For your parents. For your future children when they need confidence and strength from you. What are you even afraid of?"

"What if it's all for nothing!" Kyouka raised her voice, more tears slipping out. "I get it, okay! Izuku is pure, kind-hearted, honest, but I don't give a shit what people say. To this world, looks do matter. He may like me for me, but my body is an entirely different thing. What if...What if he finally sees everything, huh? What if he doesn't like what he sees? He's too kind to lie, but he can't hurt someone's feelings on purpose. So, what? Then we spend years together with him lying about what he thinks of me? And the-"

"Young Jirou, forgive my language, but you and I both know the only thing coming out of your mouth right now is complete and utter bullshit. You do know who we're talking about, right? This is what I'm talking about. This isn't what you really think. This is what the darkest corner of your mind is torturing you with. Fear. Even when it's impossible, the mere thought of something happening shackles you. You know as well as I do that Young Midoriya, as innocent as he may be, feels lust and desire like every other human in history. You may not be ready to hear this or say it to one another, but he loves you. God-damn does that kid love you with all his heart. And, believe it or not, even if he tries not to, he loves your body, too. I mean, c'mon. Do you see how much he stares?! Half of the time when I call on him in class, it's to get his attention off of you!"

Kyouka wiped a couple tears away, a small smile appearing on her face. "...He admitted it once. I caught him, and he said he just does it constantly."

"You see! You know! It's just your mind telling you otherwise, and you believe it, because you're the only person in your life you've completely trusted. The same goes for Young Midoriya. Neither of you have had people you completely trust except for yourselves. And, now that you have someone who you trust more than anything, you don't know how to react. You've pushed him out of that space, that comfort zone, but you still haven't left it. All because you haven't truly let Young Midoriya in like he's done to you."

Kyouka knew he was right. She may have shared a little bit during their talks, but Izuku did most of the sharing. 

"Young Jirou, you and Young Midoriya have a very special, yet very dangerous trait in common. You both can give all the love you want to other's, but none of it to yourself." Toshinori stood up, his hero form coming back to life. "You want to save the world? How are you going to do that if you can't save the one person closest to you? The one looking back at you in the mirror. You both need to learn that." Kyouka said nothing, merely looking out into the city again. "...I understand if you want to be alone. Truly, I do. If you want to talk further, about anything, not just this, I'll be there. I-...You're the most important thing to Young Midoriya. Then, that makes you important to me as well. I hope you remember that. Goodnight, Young Jirou."

He turned around, walking back towards the door. Until, he heard footsteps behind him approaching. Turning around, he was met with warmth on his chest, and arms wrapping around his back.

Kyouka hugged tight, quietly saying, "...Thank you."

Toshinori processed what was happening before placing a hand in her head. "I know it's a long road to walk, and you'll face more than just these issues along the way. Just don't forget the people you have by your side." They separated, both walking towards the door to head to their respective rooms. Once he realized all of the agency workers were gone and the floor they were on was empty, he popped back down to normal. As Kyouka opened the door to her room, Toshinori stopped her. "Ya know, one of the reasons I decided to teach at U.A was to be a job scout. See if anyone there was good enough for One For All. I had an option in mind, but I wanted to give everyone else a chance first. So, what I said about you having that same greatness Young Midoriya has, I meant it. You would've been a great choice."

"...I mean, we wouldn't have gotten to know each other like this if not for Izuku. But...thank you."

Toshinori nodded, "I just want you to know that's how highly I think of you, how much potential I see. With future heroes like you and Young Midoriya...Well, it just helps me rest easy at night when I think about the day my power finally leaves me."

"...Goodnight, All Might."

"Good night. Good luck telling him tomorrow." She went into her room, out of sight. Toshinori walked down the halls smiling to himself.

So far, he could mark this internship as a resounding success.

Kyouka closed her door, but then her brow furrowed in confusion, “...Tomorrow?”

*~“History won’t repeat itself, kid. Not this time, I promise. Not to you and Kyouka.”~*

  
  

Izuku, once again, bolted awake with his head slightly throbbing. But, all he could focus on was what he had heard. Kyouka’s name. “That…That wasn’t a memory.”
