Out of all the hospital beds Izuku had woken up upon, this was one of the best. The cushion was actually soft and didn’t feel like a slightly soft wooden board, and the blankets were actual blankets, not the thin sheets that Recovery Girl called a blanket. Overall, a solid 9/10 hospital bed.

‘Wait, hospital bed?’

Izuku’s eyes shot open, the panic rising in his chest not helped by the unfamiliar setting. This clearly wasn’t Recovery Girl’s office and judging by how the medical posters on the walls were written in English, it wasn’t anywhere he was familiar with. Izuku fought the stiffness in his neck to look around the room, seeing an L shaped room with three beds, and in the bed to his left resided the music lover of class 1-A, Jiro Kyoka. While Izuku didn’t enjoy the fact that whatever happened to him also affected one of his classmates, he was slightly relived that he wasn’t in unfamiliar territory alone.

‘Okay Izuku, try to remember what happened.’ The verdant haired boy thought, ‘We were at the mall with Aizawa and Kayama, then that scared boy, then a bright light and now here.’ While it didn’t help explain what exactly happened it did narrow it down to a Quirk accident, which exited Izuku despite his best efforts to take the situation seriously. What Quirk did the boy have? Was it teleportation? That would explain the strange hospital room. But why did Izuku and Jiro pass out? Did it use the energy of the people affected rather than the user? Maybe…

“Ugh… Moptop is that you? It’s too goddamn early for this…” Jiro’s drowsy complaints snapped Izuku out of his (non-internal) muttering. “Why the hell are you even in my… room…” Her comment died on her lips as Jiro began to look around the room, eyes widening as her own panic grew. “Where the hell are we?” Jiro almost shouted at her classmate, distress clear in her voice.

 “Do you remember when we were at the mall?” A nod from Jiro prompted Izuku to continue, “There was a boy that I think lost his mother, and his Quirk acted up. If I had to guess I think it was some sort of warp Quirk.” While Izuku did say it was a guess, to Jiro a guess from the resident Quirk nerd was as good as confirmation to her. But that just raised more questions on their situation. “Any idea where we are?” she asked, but before Izuku could respond, the door to the hospital room opened up, and two men, clearly non-Japanese, walked in.

The first had short, curvy brown hair and a mustache, glasses, and a green coat over a white dress shirt and tie. “Ah good, you’re awake.” The first man said in English while holding the door for the second man. This man was clearly much older than the first and had a head of grey hair under a flat cap, a larger mustache, and wore suspenders over a green dress shirt. “You two caused quite a stir this morning,” said the second man before letting out a small chuckle. “I’m just glad you two are doing alright.”

Luckily both of the teens had learnt English, Izuku from a desire to watch old untranslated All Might interviews from his time in America, and Jiro to understand the old classic rock albums her father had gifted to her one birthday. Izuku was the first to speak, “T-thank you for helping us, but do you know where we are? We aren’t really familiar with this place… or how we got here.”

“You’re in Stardew Valley, Pelican town to be more specific,” The grey-haired man was clearly expecting such a question from the two odd teens. “I’m Lewis, the town’s Mayor, and this is Harvey, he runs this clinic. As for how you ended up here, all we know is that our fisherman Willy found you two passed out on the beach.”

Izuku and Jiro gave each other a glance to see if the other had any idea where Pelican Town was, and clearly neither knew. Jiro spoke to the now identified Lewis, “I don’t think either of us know where that is… are we in America right now?” This time Lewis and Harvey where the ones to be confused by the situation. “I’ve never heard of a place called America,” Harvey said, almost missing the way his patients blanched at his words. “Stardew Valley is a part of the Ferngill Republic. I could get you two a map to help show where we are.”

The two teens were quirk to accept the map, hoping it had the answers to their confusion, but when Harvey brought the two a world map, it only brought more panic.

“No no no no, this… this doesn’t make sense.” Izuku muttered, “Where’s Japan, or America. What the hell is Gotoro?” before the map was snatched by one of Jiro’s ear jacks, (while Harvey made a mental note that he was correct about the prehensile nature of her extra limbs.) only to have a similar breakdown. Harvey was rather concerned with what the two were saying, and briefly considered that both of them might have a concussion from their confusion with basic geography, but the fact they both questioned the lack of the same countries was harder to explain. Suddenly the green haired boy’s eye sparked with a revelation. “The kid’s Quirk, it’s either creates some sort of illusion, or it is a warp Quirk. But not like Kurogiri, instead he can warp people to other worlds!”

The boy’s words were lost on the two natives of Pelican Town, and Harvey was making a mental note to schedule a psyche evaluation for the boy, but the strange claim seemed to mean something to the girl. “Oh, come on you can’t be serious Midoriya. That sounds like something out of some manga, or a half-baked fanfiction.” Jiro was quick to shoot down his idea, but it was clear to everyone in the room that it was not because she didn’t believe it, but because the idea of whatever the boy said being true terrified her.

Lewis made a loud coughing sound to draw the two’s attention, “I think I speak for both myself and Harvey when I say, I am totally confused by what is going on?” Harvey was quick to nod in confirmation.

Izuku looked between Jiro and Lewis while mentally deciding what the best approach was. The two had clearly shown that they were unfamiliar with the location they ended up and trying to play it off as confusion from the unconsciousness was not only not likely to work, but also cause problems in the future. A sigh escaped Izuku’s lips as he realized the best course of action was to tell the truth of what was going on no matter how strange and unbelievable it seemed.

“I know this is going to sound very strange, and it’s kind of a long story, but please hear me out.” Lewis simply nodded and dragged two chairs over for himself and Harvey to listen to the boy. “Well, it started in a a country called China, with a baby that glowed light…”

* * *

“So, you come from a world where most people have superpowers.” Said a clearly exasperated Lewis.

“Yes” Izuku confirmed.

“Both of you are training to be ‘Heroes’ and stop people that use superpowers for crime.”

“Yep.” Said Jiro.

“And a boy lost control of his ‘Quirk’ and you think it sent you to another world. Our world.”

“That’s basically all of it.” Said Izuku. He sympathized with Lewis even if he clearly didn’t believe him. It would be hard for Izuku to believe anything like what he had just said without some form of proof.

“I know both of you just had something traumatic happen, and clearly you believe what you just said, but I don’t see how anyone else could ever believe it?” Sighed Lewis, mentally wishing he could go back to this morning, when his biggest problem was collecting taxes.

“I believe them.” Harvey’s words stunned the three, Lewis that a man of science was so quick to believe the story, and the two world travelers surprised that someone believed at all. “Both of them have strange mutations in their bodies, and I doubt that someone being born with super dense musculature or two extra limbs from their ears wouldn’t be a topic of some medical journal somewhere. I’d have to call in some favors to get the equipment for a brain scan, but if I can, we can prove that they have this ‘Quirk factor’.” Harvey began muttering to himself about the potential ramifications that such a discovery could have on the medical field in a way that made Izuku feel self-conscious.

“Well regardless,” Lewis’ interjection stopped Harveys mutterings and Izuku’s self-reflection, “it doesn’t change the reality of the situation, we have two young adults that have no homes, known family, or employment.” Izuku and Jiro exchanged nervous glances, but Lewis was quick to catch the worry on their faces. “Oh, don’t worry, none of us are going to kick you out or anything like that. We here in Pelican Town take care of our own, even if they’ve been in town less than a day and washed up on a beach.” Lewis let out a small chuckle.

The two where relived that the land they ended up in seemed to be very friendly, and they were not being run out of town. “I think I have a solution that will help you two with your… problems but give me a few days to finalize some things and inform the rest of the town. Harvey, I’ll be holding a town meeting tomorrow so I can answer any questions the people have. Can you get Maru to come in and cover for you? I don’t think I can explain this by myself.” A nod from Harvey, still lost in his thoughts, was all Lewis needed before bidding his two (hopefully) newest resident’s farewell.

While Izuku and Jiro thought they would have time to rest once more after Lewis left, Harvey quickly snapped from his own personal bubble intent on grilling the two about the nature of these ‘Quirks’. “I understand you’re probably tired from today, but I do have a few questions. Now then, are people born with their Quirks present or do they manifest latter.”

Jiro was considering engaging the doctor in conversation, but upon seeing Izuku’s eyes light up at the prospect of talking Quirks with someone as interested as himself she held her tongue. Seeing him be so excited about a hobby was even kind of cute in a way. ‘Wait, cute?’

While she had an internal panic at the rouge thought of finding the biggest nerd in her class cute, Izuku was happy to explain all that he knew on the topic of Quirks, going so far as to grab his (now dry) notebook from the stack of folded clothes by his bed to show what notes he had taken on his classmate’s Quirks. It was while explaining how the exact type of Quirk could affect the time frame of manifestation that Jiro turned her focus back on the conversation.

“What do you mean 16 months, four years is 48 months?” Izuku and Harvey where both confused by the other, as something as simple as the number of months in a year shouldn’t be a point of disagreement. Suddenly Harvey had a realization and quickly left to grab a small calendar he kept in his office. “I think I understand the confusion,” Harvey said while flipping the calendar to the current date, “We must have different systems for measuring time.” True enough, as Izuku and Jiro looked through the calendar they saw one year was divided into four 28-day seasons, totaling for 112 days in a year.

Jiro kept looking through the calendar, noting the current date was Winter 26th, one day after the Feast of the Winter Star (which in her opinion just seemed like an off-brand Christmas), while Izuku explained the system the two were familiar with, one year composed on 12 months and 365 days. Luckily the system of 24 hours was constant, and the two wouldn’t have to adjust to an entirely new sleep schedule.

“So, I guess with this calendar we would be around… 52 or 53 years old.” Jiro let out an amused huff, imagining a middle aged Izuku throwing out his back fighting villains.

“Well with that out of the way I did have one last question.” Harvey pulled out some x-rays he took of the two while checking for injuries. “While most of any differences to the standard human body are explained by the presence of your Quirks, there is one thing that is still nagging me.” As Harvey placed the x-rays to the backlight, the images in question were shown to be the bones in the pair’s feet. “Kyoka, you lack a joint in your pinky toes, but Izuku doesn’t. Is this in anyway related to Quirks?”

‘Wait, isn’t the toe joint thing used to see is someone has a Quirk or not?’ Jiro thought to herself, ‘but Izuku has a Quirk. So why does he have the extra joint?’ Her questions were answered by Izuku, “W-well, normally people with Quirks only have the two toe joints. I got misdiagnosed as Q-quirkless when I went to the doctor because I was born with the extra joint. I’m kind of a medical outlier.” Jiro didn’t see anything wrong with his explanation, medical anomalies happened sometimes, and an extra toe joint wasn’t that weird. But the way he refused to meet either her or Harvey’s eyes was slightly concerning. ‘I guess being diagnosed as Quirkless was a bad day for him.’ Jiro reasoned. But even then, when his Quirk manifested it should have cleared everything up. ‘I guess I’ll ask him about it later.’

“Ah I see. Fascinating that such an evolutionary step would affect vestigial parts of the body. And yet somehow the appendix is still there.” Harvey mused. “Well, I’ve bothered you enough I feel, I’ll let you get some rest. If you need anything I’ll still be in the building.”

After Harvey turned off the lights and left the two so they could sleep, Izuku finally had time to ruminate on all the information he had been told. He was in a strange town, with strange calendars and strange nations, and no one knew what Quirks were. Even when he wasn’t Quirkless fate somehow found a way to make him the odd one out.

“Hey Midoriya,” Jiro’s voice called his attention, “When talking about the toe joint thing, you seemed pretty out of it.” While Izuku did welcome the concern, Jiro was touching on memories he would rather not dig up, memories of the day he was branded less than human to society.

“It… wasn’t a good day for me. I always wanted to be a hero, even back then. And the doctor was… not kind with how he told me.” Izuku’s voice was barley above a whisper, even in the close proximity of the hospital room, if Jiro didn’t have greater hearing with her Quirk, she might not have heard him. “he told me… ‘I’d give it up kid, it’s not gonna happen.’ Like he didn’t even care that he was telling me my dream was impossible.”

“Wow, that guy sounds like a dick.” A small chuckle escaped Izuku’s lips, which Jiro considered a win. “But hey, you showed him. I bet when you got your Quirk he changed his tune immediately.” Jiro was hoping her words would help lift the gloomy atmosphere of the conversation, but the distraught look on Izuku’s face before he turned around made it obvious, she only made it worse.

“15…” The boy mumbled out, and even with Jiro’s hearing she couldn’t hear all of what he said. “Sorry, I didn’t hear that.”

“I was 15 when I got my Quirk. Didn’t have enough muscle mass to use it without blowing myself up so my Quirk didn’t activate.” It was a practiced lie that Izuku was accustomed to telling, but the implications of such information was never easy to tell anyone. “Until the entrance exam, everyone thought I was Q-quirkless.”

“Oh…” Well, that explained a lot. Jiro had wondered how someone with such a strong Quirk was so timid, or how he made such drastic improvements with his Quirk so quickly compared to everyone else. And why Bakugou thought he was Quirkless for so long, he didn’t hide his Quirk from the blond, Izuku didn’t even know about it. Although, with the antagonistic way Bakugou always talked to Izuku, and the way he never fought back against the threats… Jiro didn’t want to make the conversation any darker, so she left those implications alone for the time being.

“Well, who cares, you would have found a way to be a Hero without a Quirk anyway.” Jiro said with the upmost confidence. Izuku was expecting a lot after such a revelation. Mockery, pity disguised as sympathy, but honest encouragement? “W-wha… t-thanks for saying that Jiro but you don’t need to lie to make me feel better.”

“I’m not lying.” Jiro assured the boy, “It seems like every day you do some crazy impossible stunt to save someone else and I’m sure you would have done it again to be a Hero, no matter what anyone else told you.” Izuku was stunned silent. Sure, he got told he could be a Hero before, but it was always passerby’s that didn’t know that he was Quirkless, even All Might only trained him to be able to receive his Quirk. But Jiro was telling him with no hint of deception that she believed he could be a Hero, no matter what.

Even in the dark it was easy to see Izuku’s face flush. “T-thank you J-jiro.”

“Kyoka.” The girl interjected

“Huh?”

“After that heavy conversation, you can call me Kyoka.” It was hard to see in the dim room, but the small yet earnest smile on Jiro’s, no, Kyoka’s face made Izuku’s heart hitch. “T-then you can call me Izuku. O-only fair.” The boy managed to sputter out.

“Sure thing, Izuku.”
