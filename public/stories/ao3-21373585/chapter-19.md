"Welp, my joints are gonna be popping for a while." Kyouka groaned, rolling her shoulder as she walked with Izuku back to the stands. "But, it's a good thing I have a boyfriend to give me massages whenever I please."

"I-I never agreed to that."

"Are you gonna do it?"

"Of course I am. But you just assumed." Kyouka chuckled, squeezing Izuku's hand in response to their banter. They had been in Recovery Girl's room for a good while after their talk, leading them to learn Kirishima had won the seemingly never-ending arm-wrestling match while watching the office television. 

Iida had taken a pretty swift victory over Mina in the meantime, a match they did actually watch from the office television. And now they were on break, giving Kirishima some time to re-energize before he had to fight Katsuki. A battle which Izuku almost didn't want to watch. 

After the race, the cavalry battle, and now his fight with Momo, it was clear Katsuki was out for blood, not letting anyone even have the slightest chance standing in his way of fighting Izuku and coming out on top. An effort all to prove to himself he was still the most skilled. 

If Izuku beat Shoto, and that was a big "if", especially with the plan he had in mind for the fight, he only had one real hope. It was true, Katsuki was his better. He had been training for years, his experience far outweighed Izuku's. But, that anger of his would hurt in the end.

Not that Katsuki would fight blindly, he was too smart for that. But, like Todoroki, his body only went so far when it came to using his quirk. After his gigantic blast in the race, constant use in the cavalry battle, and now going 100% percent in each fight, his arms were bound to be sore.

That pain and eventual cramping was Izuku's best bet. He had the blonde beat in speed. So, if Katsuki falters for even a second due to his quirk, Izuku would be able to strike.

...Again, IF he beat Shoto.

*'...Oh for the love of all that is holy, please beat Shoto.'* 

Kyouka nudged him, “I can see you sweating bullets from here...also you’re turning my hand into a saltwater lake.” 

“Ah!” Izuku quickly released her hand, finally realizing just how sweaty it was. “S-Sorry!”

Stopping them in their tracks, Kyouka turned Izuku to face her. “It’s fine. I get it. After everything Todoroki said earlier, and with how powerful he is, I understand. You saw how nervous I was when I had to fight him. But, you’re *you* . If I can manage to get close to, and even tackle Todoroki, you’ll have no trouble.”

Izuku looked away, his feet tapping, “Y-Yeah, no problem a-at all.”

Kyouka faltered, her eyes narrowing at Izuku. “...You have something planned, don’t you?”

“Wh-What?! N-No! That’s absolutely, positively, not tru-It’s entirely true.”

Sighing, Kyouka crossed her arms and leaned back on her leg. “Oh boy, what the hell are you about to do?”

“I-I want to win! I would never break my promise to you! I will win, but...Uh...I see no reason not to help Todoroki while I’m at it...just a little bit,” Izuku finished quietly.

Her brow furrowing, the musician tilted her head at her boyfriend. “...Help how?”

“O-Oh...You know...Maybe, helphiusehiolefside.” 

Taken aback by the gibberish, Kyouka raised a brow, “What?”

“...Help him use his left side.”

“That’s a really weird way of saying, “Hey Kyouka, I’m absolutely insane”. Wanna run that by me again?”  
  

Izuku shook his head, leaning against the wall. “Look, i-it’s just after everything he said, I don’t want him to keep suffering with this. To deny a part of himself, all because of the expectations put on him for it, to feel like that part of him ruined his life...I know what that feels like.”

Kyouka bit her bottom lip in thought, joining Izuku in leaning against the wall. “Yeah...Yeah, I guess you do.”

“I think...I think my eyes have been opened a lot in the past year. I’ve never known another quirkless person, so I’ve never really had anyone to relate to. Besides you, of course. But...I never in my wildest dreams would have thought I would see myself in someone who, a year ago, I would have thought was born with everything I ever wanted. It used to feel like I was the only person in the world who could understand me, but I see now that’s not true. And I don’t like that, in a way. I don’t like how there are other people who probably feel that way. I want to do my best to make sure there’s no one else that has to go through what I did. Even if it’s only in certain ways. So I want to help him use his fire, show him he doesn’t have to deny who he is just to not be like his father. He’s his own person, his own hero...It’s his power, not anyone else’s. Especially not Endeavor’s.”

Kyouka took in everything Izuku said, nodding her head as he finished. “...Do you remember what we talked about on our first date? We were talking about why we started wanting to be heroes, but how our reasonings change or we gain new ones. You didn’t really have any back then, besides just being drawn to being a hero and saving lives...I think you have another one now.”

Izuku thought about it for a second, remembering that night in the jazz club. “Huh...I guess I do.” He hadn’t really considered it, but it was true. He had another true reason to be a hero, another responsibility he wanted to take on. He wondered how many more he would find in the future. 

“...I still think you’re absolutely crazy.”

“...But?”

“... *But* , that’s one of things I like about you. And, of course, your endless drive to help people. Even if they’ve been complete assholes to you this entire time. I won’t stop you. Not sure I could even if I wanted to.”

“Y-You kinda have me wrapped around your finger. You probably could’ve convinced me.”

Kyouka smirked, “That’s true. But, it might be pretty fun for you to basically tell that abusive prick Endeavor where to shove iiiiiiiiiiiii-....”

Izuku grew concerned at Kyouka’s sudden malfunction, following her eyes behind him to come face to face with Endeav-”

“Oooooh no.”

The pro sneered down at the teens, “There you are. I’ve been looking for you.”

“O-Oh, uh…”

Kyouka quickly saw Izuku’s brain shut down, stepping up for him. “How much of that conversation did you hear?”

“I couldn’t care less about what you two were talking about.”

“Oh, thank Go-”

“Your powers…” Endeavor interrupted, turning to Izuku, “Body enhancement, correct? Along with an array of some other abilities. I haven’t seen anything on the level of All Might, but it seems you’re the closest thing I’ll be getting.”

Kyouka couldn’t help but notice that Izuku was compared to All Might *again* . *‘Well, I guess like father, like son...But, still just a little suspicious.’* 

Izuku was still struck silent, words not coming out. Kyouka once again stepped in, knowing Izuku already had trouble talking with his peers, much less his superiors. “L-Look, we don’t r-really know what you’re talking about. We were jus-”

“I’m not speaking to you.” His stare switched to Kyouka, his brows slightly raising in mirth. “I’ll admit, you gave Shoto far more of a fight than I expected. I’ll commend you for that, but you’re not even close to what I need. My son has a duty to surpass All Might,” Endeavor turned back to Izuku, “so his fight against you will be a very valuable test for his future. You’re going to give him a good fight. Give him everything.” The pro turned around and began walking away, talking sternly. “That’s all. I apologize for my intrusion and bluntness.” 

Kyouka sighed to herself, *‘That was the most civil conversation we probably could have gotten out of him, and he’s still a dick.’* 

“I-I…” Izuku spoke up, and both Kyouka and Endeavor switched their gazes to him. “I-I’m not All Might.”

The pro scoffed, “I know, I just sai-”

“And Todoroki isn’t you. He never will be.”

Endeavor’s expression went to confusion, but then a scowl formed, his voice coming out in a low growl. “...And that’s supposed to mean, exactly?”

“C-C’mon, Kyouka.” Izuku quickly grabbed Kyouka’s hand, walking the opposite direction down the hall. Endeavor watched them leave, a grunt escaping his lips as he walked away as well, deciding an interrogation of teenagers wasn’t worth it. 

They made it to the stairwell, with Kyouka covering her face and pressing her forehead against the wall. “Izuku, I’m all for you standing your ground more. But, next time can we not do it to the pro hero who can burn us into ashes in about two seconds, who we also know has seemingly no problem being harmful to minors.”

“I-I couldn’t help myself...But, yeah, not my smartest move.” He put a hand on Kyouka’s shoulder, causing her to turn back and face him. “But, I think we’re done with confrontations for a whi-...”

“What?” It was Kyouka’s turn to be confused by her partner’s sudden falter. She looked over her shoulder, past the corner that joined with the stairs, seeing Katsuki at the landing. The blonde seemed just as surprised to see them there as they were. “You’ve gotta be kidding me.”

“Sup, guys!” Much to all three teens' relief, Kirishima hopped down the steps and stood next to Katsuki, throwing an arm around the blonde’s shoulder. “We’re heading down for our match! I hope yo-...” The redhead suddenly realized how close Izuku and Kyouka were standing, with the former having a hand on her shoulder and the latter being against the wall. It also didn’t help that they were doing that completely alone in a deserted hallway. “...Ooooh, uh...We’ll just get outta your hair.”

Izuku quickly backed up from Kyouka, “I-It’s not what you think!”

“Aw, you don’t have to worry about me. I can keep secrets, unlike Ashido. She told me she suspected you two.”

Kyouka, seeing her golden opportunity to diffuse the situation, quickly chimed in. “And you really believe something gossip related that comes out of Ashido’s mouth without any proof?”

Eijirou opened his mouth to retort, but quickly stopped himself. “Okay, Ashido is a great friend...but, you’re absolutely correct. If you say nothing’s going on, then I’ll trust y-”

Katsuki suddenly growled, pushing Kirishima away and stomping down the steps. “For fuck’s sake, I don’t give a shit who Deku is fucking. Get the hell outta my way!” He turned to take the other flight of steps down, but pointed angrily up at Kirishima. “And you, Stupid Hair! Your entrance is back on the other fucking side of the stadium!”

As the blonde left, Kirishima’s eyes widened. “Holy crap, he’s right. U-Uh, I gotta go! Wish me luck!” The faux redhead quickly jogged down the hall, hoping to make it to his waiting room in time.

Izuku slid down the wall, and Kyouka gave an unenthusiastic "Good luck". She then also yelled down the steps, "Do your worst, *Kacchan* !"

"Fuck off!" echoed from below. 

Kyouka chuckled, "I may hate him, but he gives me so much material." She walked back over to Izuku, reaching down to ruffle his hair. "Well, that was a close one. Funnily enough, we weren't lying. It really wasn't anything bad."

Izuku looked up at Kyouka, exhaustion on his features. "Is it too much to ask for just one day of my life to be either emotionally exhausting, mentally exhausting, or physically exhausting, and not all three at the same time?"

"Yes."

Accepting his fate, Izuku sighed. "I thought so." He stood up, continuing his trek up the steps towards his class’ seats. Recovery Girl’s office was on the other side of the stadium from 1-A, so it was taking a few minutes. 

**“And the battle has begun!”** Mic announced over the intercom.

Reaching their floor, Kyouka turned to Izuku. “So, we already know Legally Blonde is on a warpath. How long do you think Kirishima will last?”

Sighing, Izuku shrugged, “I don’t know. Honestly, not long.” They reached the door to their seats, Izuku’s hand on the doorknob. “He can’t win, not against Kacchan’s quirk. Kirishima’s defense is great, but after too long he’ll be worn down. But, who knows? Maybe he’ll last longer than I thin-”

**\*BOOM\* \*BOOM\* \*BOOM\* \*BOOM\* \*BOOM\***

**“AND WE HAVE A WINNER!!!”**

Izuku’s eyes widened, he immediately ran through the door and looked down at the field. The ring held Katsuki, his arm outstretched with a scorch mark out in front of him. Kirishima laid in the grass, the front of his jacket burned, his quirk only covering about half of his body.

Midnight waved her flail, “Kirishima is out of bounds! Bakugou moves on to the next round!”

Kyouka turned to her friends, “What happened?”

Ochako looked at Kyouka solemnly, “Kirishima got a few hits in, even took one of Bakugou’s explosions without flinching. But, uh…” She stopped, trying not to imagine being in the redhead’s situation. 

“Bakugou didn’t take exception to that,” Momo finished for her. “Once he saw Kirishima tank an explosion, he went ballistic, throwing out blasts at full power. He seemed to figure out that Kirishima's power couldn’t outlast him forever.” 

Iida crossed his arms, leaning back in his chair. “This means I’ll have to face off against Bakugou. As rude and arrogant as he is, it truly seems like he has the power to back up his claims.”

Kyouka looked towards Izuku, gauging his reaction. He was still staring down at Kirishima, rubbing his chest slightly. Seeing someone else on the ground, burnt, surrounded by scorch marks just like the ones at the playground, it definitely wasn’t a good sight for him. “Hey, you alright?”

Izuku jumped out of his stupor, turning to Kyouka. “O-Oh, yeah. Just thinking.”

Nodding, the musician looked back to Iida, trying to think of something Izuku would say as battle advice. “He’s trying to take everyone down as fast as he can, making sure they don’t have even the slightest chance of beating him. You need to be faster.”

Iida smirked, “I can do that.”

“And skill.”

He pushed up his glasses, “I do believe I can supply that as well.”

“And you’ll need a whole lot of luck.”

“That, I’m not sure about.”

**“Alright, everyone!”** Mic yelled over the speakers, **“We’ll have a short break as our next fighters prepare themselves for the coming battles! See you in ten minutes!”** 

Izuku took a deep breath, turning back around, despite just arriving. “Looks like I’m up.” As he stood, so did Shoto...And for some reason Kaminari.

Kyouka turned around in her seat, looking up at the electric-quirk user. “What are you doing?”

He saluted Izuku, “Honoring another one of the fallen.”

“You just really want me to punch you, don’t you?”

“I’m just being honest! We all saw what happened to you and Sero! I’d be doing the same for everyone else, even Bakugou...but, don’t tell him I said that.”

“I’m 100% going to tell him.”

Izuku decided to ignore Kaminari and take his leave, exiting the seating area just after Todoroki. They parted ways, Izuku heading towards the other side of the stadium. Once he did, he began walking down the steps, coming face to face with Katsuki.

For some reason, the universe was having a field day with making them come face-to-face before their fight.

Izuku tried to pass him, walking down the stairs without a word, but Katsuki suddenly grabbed his arm and looked him dead in the eye. Izuku’s heart began pounding in his chest, his flight or fight senses shutting down, fear taking its place to freeze him to the spot. “Beat him.”

Izuku didn’t know what to do, so he turned to someone who would. So, what would Kyouka do?

...Sarcasm.

“Thanks for the words of encouragement.”

Katsuki furrowed his brow in confusion, which was mostly due to Izuku’s tone not coming off as sarcastic and instead legitimately genuine. 

Izuku decided to take it as disarming Katsuki with the unexpected. 

**“Is there a problem here, boys?”**

Both teens looked up the stairs to see All Might,  arms crossed and a brow raised. Katsuki took his hand off Izuku’s arm. “No. Just needed to say something.”

Toshinori walked down the steps, placing a hand on Katsuki’s shoulder, **“Young Bakugou, I understand you’ve been a bit troubled as of late. Need I remind you of your behavior and the warning I gave you during Battle Training. As heroes, we must not just strive to stand and work along with the people we protect, but our fellow heroes and peers. Perhaps yo-”** 

Katsuki shrugged off All Might’s hand, walking up the steps. “Get your damn hand off me. I don’t need any advice, and I don’t need to get along with that nerd, or any of the other idiots around here. I’m fine on my own.” 

**“Friends make us strong, Young Bakugou.”** All Might called up.  
  

“You work alone. Even gave up your sidekick. I don’t need anyone draggin’ me down.”

With Katsuki now out of sight, Toshinori sighed, **“He’s far more difficult than I imagined.”**

Izuku nodded, “You have no idea.”

**“Well, no matter. People like him always say things like that, yet are proven wrong in the end...Usually...Hopefully...Maybe...”** Izuku opted out of saying just how far from a normal lone wolf Katsuki was. **“Now, Young MIdoriya, let’s head down to your waiting room. I’ve been trying to find time to talk to you for a while now, but a certain lady friend of yours has been attached to your hip.”**

“A-Ah, well…”

**“Not that I blame you, of course. I encouraged this young love, and still do. Besides, I must admit, it is very cute.”** 

“All Might!”

**“Haha! C’mon, let’s go.”** Walking down the steps, neither of them noticed a certain blonde still listening from up the steps, curious as to why and how Izuku and All Might were on such friendly terms. At least, friendlier terms than any of the other students seemed to be.

...

**(Fighter’s Waiting Room)**

All Might groaned as he popped out of his buff form, slumping down in one of the chairs. “Alright, finally. Now, I wanted to talk with you about your fight with Shinsou.” All Might breathed in deeply, his hands pressed together, then pointed them out at Izuku. “...What?”

“I-It’s a little hard to explain,” Izuku said, sitting down across from his mentor. “Well, first I was brainwashed.”

“Uh huh.”

“And then he made me walk out of the ring.”

“Uh huh.”

“And then I saw what I think might’ve been the previous users of One For All.”

“Uh huh.”

“And then I heard this voi-”

“Woah! Wait a minute! Back it up! You saw what?!”

Izuku leaned forward in his seat, trying to focus on the memory. “There were seven or eight shadows, I think. I didn’t get an exact number, but I do know one of them kind of looked like you.”

Toshinori leaned back, rubbing his chin in thought. “Hmm...Well, I saw something like that only once before when I was young, but it wasn’t like this. I have to assume it wasn’t One For All that broke you out of the brainwash. Your own strong will is the likely answer.”

“U-Uh...I don’t think so, because that’s not all.”

“What do you mean?”

Izuku ran his hand through his hair as he reminisced, “I sort of...called out to them. A-And they answered. And, I mean literally. There was a voice.”  

Toshinori’s eyes widened, his brow furrowing in confusion. “You...You called out to them, and...it answered back?”

“Yeah. A woman’s voice.”

*‘...It couldn’t have been…”* Toshinori thought.

Izuku continued, “I screamed in my head for anything to stop me, and that’s when it happened. She laughed and said, “Whatever you say, kiddo”.” 

*‘Yep, it’s definitely her.’*  Toshinori sighed, nodding his head. “That had to have been my predecessor.” 

“Your predecessor? You mean that was your mentor?”

“Yes, I believe so. But...this is...she *talked* to you. I’ve had strange visions before, but…” Toshinori frowned, a hint of sadness in his eyes. “...In the thirty years she’s been gone, I’ve never had any sort of communication with her. Or, her echo, I mean.”

“What do you think it means?”

“To be perfectly honest with you, I don’t know. This and your ability to manipulate One For All’s external power are completely foreign to me. For now the best guess I can give is One For All is truly merging with you properly, fully becoming yours. I’m sorry, but that’s the only answer I can give for now.”

Izuku nodded, looking down at his hands as he thought about what exactly was happening to him. If All Might had never seen anything like that before, he had to assume his predecessor had never done anything like that either. And, unless she didn’t tell Toshinori about it, no one before her had that ability either. 

Were the predecessors watching him? Was One For All alive in some way, or did it stockpile more than just strength. As if it was a storage drive for souls. All Might called it “echoes”, so maybe they were copies. Kyouka’s voice might not have been what broke him out of the brainwash, but her voice seemed to be the beginning of the chain of events.

**“Alright fighters! It’s time to begin the next match!”**

Questions for another time, apparently.

Toshinori stood up, “Okay, it’s time. Now, Young Midoriya, I know Young Todoroki is a very daunting opponent. But, I have no doubt you have every intention to take him down quickly with your new speed.”

“Y-Yeah...Of course.”

Toshinori furrowed his brow, “...You hesitated there for a second.”

“...”

“...What are you about to do?”  
  

“A-Ah, well wish me luck!” Izuku quickly made his exit, speed-walking down the hall. He already had Kyouka worried. The last thing he needed was to worry All Might as well. He made promises to both of them, and he intended on keeping them.

Correction: He intended on *trying* to keep them.

The cheers of the crowd grew louder as he approached the blinding sunlight. Stepping out onto the field, Izuku made his way up the steps, Shoto standing across from him. 

**“On one side we have the other half of our dynamic duo, carrying on for both of them, Izuku Midoriya! And on the other side, we have the solution to the melting polar ice caps, Shoto Todoroki!”**

Breathing in deep, Izuku locked eyes with Shoto. This was where their declarations of war against one another came to fruition. Izuku knew Todoroki would send his ice out immediately, but he was ready. He gathered everything he could about Shoto throughout the day, and it was time to put it to use.

Lightning flared up around Izuku as he got into his stance. He hadn’t lost a battle yet.

And he certainly wouldn’t lose the war.

**“BEGIN!”**

As expected, ice immediately fired at Izuku at breakneck speeds. *‘Full Cowl: 7%!!!’*  

No matter how sore he would be after the battle, keeping One For All above five percent was his only option. He could endure the pain. His plan was simple…

Okay, it was absolutely crazy. But, still simple.

First Step: Stay on Todoroki’s right side.

If Kyouka heard that she would kick his ass, but it was crucial to making Todoroki use his fire. Shoto’s track record in all his fights proved that he generally kept his ice attacks large, making it basically impossible for most opponents to dodge. Kyouka managed for a little bit, but only because she kept to Shoto’s left. 

But, Izuku had the speed to maneuver around it, and the strength to break out quickly if need be. If he kept to Shoto’s right, escaping all of the ice attacks, the right side of the ring would be completely blocked out. His left side would be the most readily available to use. Now, Izuku knew that wouldn’t be enough to make Shoto use his fire, and he could simply pivot and use his ice on the left. Not to mention Izuku’s space was now limited as well.

But, Izuku’s solution to that was in the next step.

Sprinting to his left, or Shoto’s right, Izuku dodged the glacier just as it shot out over the edge of the ring. He burst forward, awaiting the next attack. Spike after spike of ice continued to shoot out at Izuku, and each one he dodged to the best of his ability. The attacks were smaller than the first one, most likely just to slow him down. But, Izuku’s speed was proving too much for Shoto. Soon, there was very little room to run, causing Shoto to see his opening. With Izuku surrounded by ice, nowhere to run, Shoto released another large wave of ice. 

Izuku quickly clambered up the wall of ice next to him, but the ice was slowing him down with how slick it was. *‘I can’t run, so I need to…’* The ice reached his feet, the cold spreading up his ankles. *‘JUMP!’* 

Raising his power just a bit more, Izuku broke free of his ensnarement and flew over the glacier. The raise in power cramped his leg, making him have to roll on his landing. He stood up quickly, limping back and raising his hand up, ready to use all of his power as he was expecting another attack.

But, Shoto didn’t attack. He was standing at the other end in confusion. He looked to Izuku, “Wha-...What are you doing?”

With pain still in his leg, Izuku decided to keep him talking until it subsided. “What do you mean?”  
  

Shoto squinted at the ice he had made, all of it covering one side. It wouldn’t be much of a surprise, except for the fact that Izuku stayed there. He never once tried to maneuver anywhere else. And it was all...on his right.

Shoto’s glare swerved towards Izuku, “He...You spoke to him, didn’t you?”

Izuku shook his head, “I-It’s not what you think.”

“You’re trying to make me use my left side.”

“...Okay, it’s exactly what you think, just not for the reason you think.” He could practically hear Kyouka facepalming. Izuku's cramp finally subsided as he allowed One For All to flow through him once more. “Just trust me.” Izuku burst at Shoto, entering his half of the ring with electricity trailing behind him. 

Second Step: Apply Pressure.

Shoto pivoted to his left, his right foot sending out more ice. But, he wasn’t fast enough. Being so early into formation, the ice he created was smaller and weaker. Izuku smashed right through it, slamming a right hook into Shoto’s jaw. Before tumbling backwards, the son of Endeavor grabbed Izuku’s arm, ice forming on his skin. 

Izuku yanked his arm free of Todoroki’s grasp, slamming his arm into his opponent's stomach, shattering the ice on it. Seven percent of his power proved to be more than he expected, as Shoto was lifted off his feet and was seconds away from falling out of the ring. 

He could’ve just let him fall, take the victory. And, as much as Izuku knew how crazy it would seem, he wouldn’t be able to move past that win. Because to him, it would be no victory at all.

So, much to the crowd's shock, Izuku grabbed Shoto’s leg and spun him around, throwing him back into the ring.

**“...Uh…” Present Mic came in through the speakers, “He...He does know what he just did, right? He knows knocking his opponent off the ring is his goal?”**

Up in the 1-A seats, they all were just as confused as the rest of the crowd. Momo shook her head in disbelief, “What on Earth is Midoriya doing? He was going to win.”

“I dunno,” Ochako responded. “They seem to be arguing about something down there, so maybe it has something to do with that. They’ve kinda been at each other’s throats all day. Jirou, can you hear anything?” 

Kyouka perked up at the sound of her name, “Uh, n-no. I can’t focus in with the crowd talking like this.” It wasn’t exactly a lie, as it was far more difficult to hear with all the people around. But, she could hear snippets, and it seemed like Izuku was enacting his plan. She didn’t know the fine details of it, so Kyouka had no clue as to if it was actually going accordingly. As insane as it was, she still couldn’t help but admire Izuku.

He always had this self appointed responsibility to help everyone. Kyouka knew that’s what she was trying to be a hero for, but Izuku was on a different level. Kyouka held grudges, she was impatient with others, quick to judge at times. And she knew those were traits likely to never go away. Hell, Izuku seemed to like it, so why get rid of them even if she could. But, to have the heart and need to still help those people you thought that way about was something she thought she could learn from. 

For example, she could tell Kaminari there was a spider crawling up his leg.

...Buuut it would still be funny if she didn’t.

*‘One step at a time, Kyouka.’*

*...*

  
  

Murmurs emanated through the crowd, and Izuku inwardly cringed. He must’ve seemed like an absolute psychopath who wanted the fight to last as long as he could make it. That definitely wouldn’t look good for his internship requests. But, he couldn’t worry about that. Not at the moment. Shoto slid across the concrete, growling as he slammed his hand into the ground to send more ice Izuku’s way. Dodging to the right, Izuku halted once he was back in the center of the remaining side of the ring. 

Shoto got up, frost covering his body and cracking with every move he made. “What the hell is wrong with you! You could have won! Why are you going so far! What did my old man offer you to do this!” 

“Nothing! I’m not doing this for him! I’m doing this for *you* ! I-I...I know...I know understand how yo-”

“No! You don’t!” Shoto slammed his hand into the ground once more, a glacier with the potential to be the size of the one he used to freeze Sero began to form. Izuku couldn’t dodge that one. Seven percent wouldn’t be enough to break it, and ten probably wouldn’t either. He had two options, and he decided to opt for the one that didn’t leave his arms completely shattered. 

He remembered back to the USJ, his fight with Shinso, and his fight with Shiozaki. That same tug in his gut, his desire to win for everyone who believed in him. zuku charged up the power flowing through his muscles, feeling it claw at his skin to be released. 

“URRAAAAAAAHHHH!” 

Energy burst from his body as he felt his feet lift off the ground, exploding the oncoming ice and the glaciers in his immediate vicinity. It rammed through Shoto’s ice and hit him directly, sending him flying back and tumbling once more. Izuku fell back to the concrete, his legs buckling beneath him. He hit the ground, his body vibrating and his muscles weak. Whatever this new power was, it wasn’t meant to be used so often. At least, not yet. 

Izuku struggled to push himself, gazing at his now clear strip of the arena between him and Shoto. Remnants of the ice were scattered everywhere, even outside of the ring. “I...I do understand!” Shoto grit his teeth at Midoriya’s words, doing his best to push past the electric current still stinging his muscles. “I know what it’s like to hate a piece of yourself! To have important parts of your life stripped from you, and given nothing but pain in return! I’m fighting so I can live up to the expectations of the people who saved me from that! I have to give my everything, so that all they’ve done for me won’t go to waste. But...But, I’m doing it for myself, too. I realized that doing something for my own well-being, my own future, was okay. You need to see that, too!” These were words he never would have admitted to anyone, except for Kyouka. But, if it meant saving someone from themself, saving them from turning out like himself, then he had to. Besides, with all the fights he’s watched, he knew most people couldn’t hear a word he was saying. Kyouka was likely one of the few who could actually listen in. “But you can’t do this! You can’t just throw something so valuable to you away! You have to stop denying who you are!

Shoto grunted as he stood back up, his body still vibrating from electricity. “I am *NOT* my father’s weapon!”

“You’re your own hero! This is *your* life! You’re trying to rebel against who you are, but you’re just letting him control you in a different way!”

Shoto faltered, looking down at his hands as he thought about what Izuku had just said. “No...No, that’s…”

“You still can’t be who you want to be because of what he’s made you think you are! But, who would your mother want you to be!? Who do *YOU* want to be!?”

*~“Shoto, you want to be a hero, right?”~*

Shoto’s eyes closed, his face clenching as lost memories flooded his mind. Izuku didn’t stop, continuing to drive his point home. “Stop being held back by what you think is a curse! It’s not a curse!”

*~”That’s okay...just...just promise me…”~*

“IT’S YOUR POWER! NOT HIS!”

*~”Promise me that you won’t be bound by your father’s blood...his wishes…”~*

The flood gates were open, Shoto’s vision was overtaken by the memory. Watching All Might talk about quirks on the TV, his mother holding him as he gazed in awe at his hero. 

*~”You decide who you want to be, Shoto* .”~

A blazing heat began to rise in the arena, the gleaming ice already beginning to sweat.

 ~” *This life, your quirk…”~*

Once the warmth hit Izuku, it was clear to him what was happening. He smiled, knowing what awaited him was...

*~”...it belongs to you.”~*

Fire.

The fiery inferno engulfed Shoto’s left side, the flames giving off a heat so strong it was felt in the crowd. 

Kyouka’s eyes widened as she shot out of her seat, “Oh holy crap, why did I let him do this?”

“YES, SHOTOOOO!!!” All eyes shifted down to the bottom half of the stadium, Endeavor walking up to the front row. “You’ve finally accepted what you truly are! What you were born to be! With my blood pumping through your veins, you’ll fulfill your destiny! Yo-...” Endeavor faltered once he saw the smile on Todoroki’s face, one of the reactions he least expected from his son. The other boy was smiling as well...He had a feeling there was more going on than he thought.

Izuku sighed in relief, his efforts rewarded. “Amazing.”

“I don’t know what the hell you hope to gain out of this.” Shoto said, looking up at Izuku. “I still think you’re completely crazy, but...for what you did, and why...I’m sorry for what’s about to happen.” Fire and ice working in tandem grew from Shoto’s body at an alarming rate, so Izuku needed to respond.

“So am I.”

Final Step: Win.

...Yeah, he didn’t exactly put too much thought into that last part.

*‘Full Cowl: 10%!!!’* All of his muscles were consumed in pain, but that didn’t matter to him. *‘Come at me with everything you’ve got, Todoroki!’*  He rushed forward, curving around or charging through ice as it formed. Punching through one final formation, he was in the final stretch towards his opponent, bursting towards Shoto with everything his limited percentage could give him. He was nearing Shoto, his flames bursting from him like a funneling inferno as the ice around him melted and evaporated into nothing. He clearly was faster than Shoto was expecting, as he saw his eyes widen and quickly shoot out his hand. *‘Now!’*

Izuku quickly tugged on the feeling in his chest, electricity shooting from his skin. As it pulsed through his veins, Izuku released the power. The blast hit Shoto dead on, sending the teen sliding back and stunned for a moment. Izuku’s window was small, but it was hopefully enough. Ducking to his left to stay on Shoto’s right, Izuku raised his arm up as Shoto did his.

 “Thank you, Midoriya” A blinding light flashed from Shoto’s hand, nearly consuming Izuku’s vision. 

“SMAAASH!!!” Izuku leaped forward, his fist rocketing into Shoto’s nose, driving them both towards the edge of the ring as a searing heat consumed the air around them.

**\*BOOOOM\***

The extreme heat on Izuku’s body soon turned into a slam of force. The rising heat against the chilled air caused a blast, shooting the teens away from each other. Ice and debris flew from the ring and into the air, the entire stadium yelling in panic and ducking for cover. 

Up in the stands, Mina shouted, “Every woman for herself!” She picked up Mineta from his seat and used him as a human shield, ice chunks pelting him. 

“Woah, wait! What are you doi-Ah! OW! OUCH! HELP!”

Back in the ring, Izuku scraped against the ground, shooting One For All into his left hand and slamming his fingers into the concrete to stop his speeding skid across the ring.

He immediately regretted it, as in his panic he put too much power in his fingers, causing them to burst with blood. It didn’t fully stop him either, his fingers dragging through the solid material until he came to a stop a few meters afterwards. He was simply glad he used his left arm, as he could already feel his right was covered in extreme burns. Half of his body was dangling over the edge, his foot only a few centimeters from the grass below. Hoisting himself up with a grunt of pain, Izuku rolled onto his back completely exhausted. He needed to get up before Shoto, or he would lose for su-”

“Todoroki is out of bounds! Izuku Midoriya advances to the final round!”

...What?

Izuku quickly shot up, looking at the other side of the ring as the crowd cheered. Shoto was against the wall, half of his jacket completely gone. Looking up at the giant screen, the replay showed the final clash in slow motion. Both teens were blown away from one another due to Shoto’s blast on Izuku’s body. But, Izuku’s punch knocking Shoto off his feet, along with the dual-quirk user being far closer and pushed to the edge, he was knocked out of the ring. 

Izuku laid back down in shock as he heard the paramedics coming to take him to Recovery Girl. 

...He actually did it.

*‘I...I did it!’* And now, he could face Katsuki. *‘...Oh no, I did it.’*

With exhaustion finally taking over, Izuku felt Recovery Girl place a kiss on his cheek before succumbing to sleep. 

…

  
  

**(45 Minutes Later: Recovery Girl’s Stadium Office)**

Izuku could feel his consciousness coming back, muffled voices reaching his ears. 

“What the hell am I going to do with you?/”What the hell am I going to do with you?”

...Yeah, those were probably the words he should have expected when waking up. And from the two people he should have expected.

“Jinx.”

Kyouka scoffed as she turned to All Might, or more appropriately Toshinori from her limited knowledge. “And you’re the adult here?”

Recovery Girl chuckled, “Tell me about it.”

All Might looked over his shoulder at the nurse, “I heard that.”

“You were supposed to.”

Izuku groaned, moving to sit up, “You guys couldn’t even give me ten second to wake up before starting all this.”

The trio all jumped, realizing Izuku was awake. Kyouka chuckled, “Jokes on you, we’ve been at this for a while.”

“Yeah, I figured. How long have I been out?”

“Nearing an hour.”

“So I’m assuming I missed Iida’s fight against Kacchan. And?”

Kyouka sighed, “Yeah, same as usual. Blondie made it quick and painful. Iida landed a solid kick, using that burst move of his. But, it didn’t knock Bakugou out of the ring, used his explosions to keep his distance. The match was basically over by then. Iida’s engines stalled, so he couldn’t exactly do much. I’m not sure how he’s taking it, though. We haven’t seen him since.”

“Damn. So when am I up?” 

Toshinori stepped in, “Woah, hold on there. You’re not going anywhere until we’re sure you’re feeling alright. After Iida’s match, they said once you woke up you would have an hour to rest before you have to forfeit. I mean, people have to go home eventually.”

“I-I think I’m okay. Still tired, but I’ll be fine in a bit.  And I didn’t break my arms, so that’s a plus.”

Recovery Girl shook her head, “Tell that to your fingers. Thankfully they weren’t completely fractured through the bone, but you definitely damaged them. What do you expect when you jam them into concrete, too? But, in the grand scheme of your previous injuries, this is nothing too serious. Some burns here and there, but my quirk handled most of it and the rest should heal fairly quickly given you don’t bother them for a week or so. Maybe some minor scarring.” Izuku nodded his head, bringing his hands up to look at them. Both arms had red wrappings around them, reaching just past his forearms.

“Red bandages?”

Chiyo nodded towards Kyouka and All MIght, who both shrugged and said simultaneously, “Thought it would look cool.”

...Well, at least Kyouka and All Might were getting along.

Izuku sat back against the pillows again, turning to All Might. “I have to fight Kacchan next, for real this time. Any words of encouragement?”

“Beat his ass, Young Midoriya.”

“Wh-...Seriously?”

“Yep.”

While Izuku was confused, Kyouka was absolutely dying next to them. “Pfft, hahahahahahahahaha! Oh, heheheh! I couldn’t have said it better myself.”

Izuku shrugged, “I guess I’ll take it.”

Kyouka sat on the edge of the bed, “Do you need anything?”

“To be honest with you, not eating earlier is coming back to bite me.”

“Uuuugh, the cafeteria is on the other side of the stadium...You’re lucky I like you so much. I’ll be back.” She leaned in, but looked back at Toshinori and Chiyo. “Turn around.”

Toshinori chuckled, “We both already know, so ther-”

“Turn around!” 

“Okay, okay.” The two adults turned their backs to the couple, prompting Kyouka to give Izuku a couple quick pecks on the lips before taking her leave.

As she closed the door behind her, she raised a brow. *‘Young Midoriya, huh? All Might does that, too. I guess it’s more common to say than I thought.’*  

With Kyouka out of the room, Izuku turned to All Might, “I, uh...I guess I have some explaining to do, don’t I?”

“Yep.” Recovery Girl read the room, deciding to leave the duo alone for the time being. Once she was gone, Toshinori continued. “So, what was that down there? You actively made sure Young Todoroki went all out against you.”

“I-It’s a little complicated. Todoroki told me that he refused to use his left side, because of Endeavor. I’m not sure I can go into the specifics, bu-”

“Because of the quirk marriage.”

Izuku’s eyes went wide, “You know?”

“When you’ve been in the industry for as long as I have, you learn things most don’t. I’ve always been polite to Endeavor, but my opinion of him is...less than stellar. He did a good job keeping his family life under lock and key, but no matter who you are, there will always be whispers. So, I’m assuming Young Todoroki wasn’t using his fire to rebel against his father, especially after what happened to his poor mother.”

“Y-Yeah, that’s about it. He didn’t want to be a weapon, or a tool. But...I thought it was the wrong way to go about it. So, in true Izuku Midoriya fashion, I stuck my nose where it didn’t belong.”

“And I’m proud of you for it.” 

“Really?”  
  

“Young Midoriya, giving help to others, even when they don’t ask for it, is one of the main priorities of being a hero.” Toshinori hummed to himself, “Hmm, and I understand how Young Todoroki feels. He shouldn’t have to live with that.”

Izuku quickly sat up, his eyes furrowing in confusion. “You do?”

Toshinori faltered a bit, indicating to Izuku that he didn’t actually intend to reveal that information. “Well…” Toshinori then sighed, “You know, I guess if there’s anyone who deserves to know, it’s you. I trust you with One For All, and I’d trust you with my life. So I trust you with this, too. I know I don’t have to say this, but please don’t share this anywhere. I guess since you plan to tell Young Jirou about One For All, making her your most trusted confidant, I can trust her with this information as well. I know how much you don’t like lying, especially to her. But, please, only her. This isn’t even something I want in your notebooks. My personal information isn’t something I share commonly.”

Izuku nodded attentively, “Of course! I swear on my life.”

“Alright then.” Toshinori took a deep breath, clasping his hands as he thought back on his life. “Young Midoriya...I, too, am a product of a quirk marriage.”

“Wh-What? Really?”

Nodding, Toshinori continued. “Yes, sadly. They were far more common back then, just as I’m sure it was when Endeavor got married. But, I wasn’t what my parents wanted. I came out quirkless.”

Izuku’s heart almost stopped right there, “...You...You were quirkless?”

“It wasn’t as rare as it is now, but still uncommon. But, yes, I was.”

“...Why didn’t you tell me?”

Toshinori sighed again, “Two reasons. One, you didn’t ask. If you did, I would have answered that honestly. Two...I was ashamed. I saw myself in you, a quirkless kid wanting nothing more than to be a hero, but...I crushed your dreams.”

“N-No, yo-”

“Don’t lie to me, Young Midoriya. I know what I did.” Izuku closed his mouth, letting All Might continue. Besides, he couldn’t deny it would have been a lie if he did say his dreams weren’t destroyed before his very eyes for the millionth time in his life. Although, that time was far worse than most. Except for... *that* night.

“But, you didn’t lie. I couldn’t have been a hero without a quirk.”

“You don’t know tha-”

“Yes, I do.” Izuku said sternly, making All Might stutter for a moment. 

  
“...Listen, we don’t truly know what would have happened. Not really. But, I still destroyed your dreams when mine came true, even though we were both quirkless. Whether I was lying or not, it still has some level of hypocrisy from a certain point of view.”

Izuku looked away, his eyes towards his lap. “Did...Did you choose me becaus-”

“Because I felt guilty? No. Never think that, you understand me? I chose you because I saw the heart of a hero, a heart better than anyone’s, even mine. You are the best choice. Okay?”

“Oka-”

“No, repeat it back to me.”

“...I was chosen for my heart, and because I was the best choice.”

Toshinori nodded, moving back to the original topic. “Anyway, my quirklessness...displeased them. They were never after parenthood. Like Endeavor, they wanted a powerful child. The difference being Endeavor did it for pride and legacy. My parents did it for profit, as back in the day a powerful child eventually sent into the hero industry was essentially guaranteed wealth. Of course, another reason as to why quirk marriages are outlawed now. So, when my tests came back negative, I was given up.”

“Given up? Like…”

“Given to Child Services and put up for adoption at the age of four, yes.” Izuku felt sick. As questionable as his relationship to how own parents were, they *never* would have done that.

“...I’m sorry.”

“It’s fine, really. It’s not like I was close with them.”

“W-Well, they were trying for powerful children, so does that mean you have siblings somewhere?”

Toshinori shook his head, “No. My father died in a villain attack 7 months later. I learned in my highschool days that my mother died of a heart attack some years later. She never remarried, no recorded children. It doesn’t matter to me. It put me on the path I am today. I met you, and...and I eventually did have a mother.”

“Someone adopted you?”

“No, I never met with any of the families that came in. Didn’t want to. My mentors paid for my admission into UA, so it all turned out fine. Like I said, it’s really nothing to worry about. I just know how Young Todoroki feels. It feels like you were born a tool, not a human.” Toshinori stood up, ruffling Izuku’s hair. “But, that’s part of why we’re here. To make something of ourselves. To be more. Anyway, that's enough strolling down memory lane for one day. Rest up, my boy. And good luck.” He began to walk out of the room, but stopped when Izuku called out to him, his hand on the doorknob.

“Is that one of your reasons for being a hero? To make something of yourself?”

“...Well, the lives of the innocent and bringing hope to all was the main priority above all, but...yes.” 

“One more thing, All Might.” Toshinori turned back around, raising a brow to signal Izuku to continue. “Um...After the Sports Festival...That’s when I want to tell Kyouka. I-I know it’s a little sudden, bu-”

“Are you certain?”

“Huh?”

“Are you certain she’s the one for you? The person you can trust for the rest of your life, and with your life?”

Izuku, without hesitation, nodded, “Yes.”

Toshinori smiled with a chuckle, “Well, then who am I to stop you?” With that, he left Izuku alone, walking out the door and coming face-to-face with Kyouka, a tray of food in her hands. He opened the door for her, moving out of the way so she could enter.

“Oh, thanks.”

“No problem. By the way, welcome to the Circle of Trust,” Toshinori said with a small laugh, walking down the hall with his hands in his pockets.

“Hm? What’s that mean?”

Without turning back, Toshinori waved behind him. “You’ll figure it out.”

Kyouka squinted in confusion, walking into the nurse’s office. “Oookay, what’s the “Circle of Trust”?”

Izuku perked up, “He said that?”

“Uh, yeah. Just as he was leaving he said I was in it.”

“Okay, um...Don’t punch me, but...it kinda involves the stuff I’m going to tell you after the Sports Fe-”

*\*Jab\**

“Ow!” Izuku yelped, rubbing the spot on his shoulder where Kyouka’s jack hit him. “I said don’t punch me!” 

“Wasn’t a punch.”

“Semantics! Ah,whatever. Just please wait a little longer. Tonight, I promise. No later.” 

Kyouka chuckled, setting the tray down on the table next to the bed. “You act like I wasn’t going to go along with it. There’s no pressure. Now, eat and digest this before you throw it up when you have to fight Bakugou.” 

“That’s...actually a good point.” He began digging in, thanking Kyouka for making the trip. She sat down next to him, crossing her legs as she leaned back.

“You know my parents are going to freak out if you win this, right?”

“I’m just surprised your dad didn’t say I had to win to prove I was worthy of you.”

“Oh, did you miss that email?” Kyouka replied sarcastically.

Izuku laughed, “Email? He would more likely stab a letter to my door.”

Laughing at the image, Kyouka crossed her arms over her stomach as she checked the time. Izuku’s rest period was rapidly approaching its end. “I would say I’m getting nervous for you, but I know you’re probably worse.”

“Oh, I’m definitely worse, but...But I don’t have a choice. If I lost against Todoroki, it would have to happen at some point. In fact…” Izuku got out of bed, stretching his muscles. “...I might as well get this over with. I’ll go find Recovery Girl, tell her I’m ready.”

“She’ll disagree.”

“Yeah, I know. But, it’s my choice.”

Hopping off the bed, Kyouka walked around to Izuku. “Do you want me to come with you?”

“I’ll be fine. Just...watch me, okay? I doubt I would’ve gotten this far without you.”

“Ah, you would’ve found a way.”

“I find that highly unlikely.” 

Kyouka rolled her eyes, reaching up and cupping both of Izuku’s cheeks. “Well the same goes for me.” They kissed, Izuku’s arms wrapping around her back. “I-I, Uh...I...I care about you.”

Izuku thought he was about to tear the muscles in his cheeks with the smile that broke out on his face. It wasn’t the “L Word”, and it’s not like he was expecting that. It was too soon. But, this...this he could work with.

“I care about you, too.” 

…

**(15 Minutes Later: Northern Exit Tunnel Waiting Room)**

It didn’t take long for the match to start once it was announced Izuku was ready. Katsuki had been so eager he was already in his waiting room the second he heard. But, now it was time. He could hear Present Mic pumping up the crowd from outside.

Izuku tightened his bandages, picking up his phone and putting it in one of the cabinets nearby so it wouldn’t be damaged in battle. But, just as he was about to set it down, it vibrated. Izuku checked it, surprised by who sent the message.

*Unknown Number: “Midoriya, it’s Mika. Kyouka gave us your number. We should’ve gotten it anyway. You’re dating our daughter after all. But I just wanted to say Kyoutoku and I are rooting for you! We believe in you!”*

It took everything in Izuku’s power to not start crying. The last thing he needed was to walk out there and Katsuki saw him in tears. But...he couldn’t help but feel blessed. Sending a quick thank you in response, Izuku put his phone down and headed for the door.

He was ready.

Izuku walked out into the light, the cheers of the crowd overwhelming him. **“We’re in for the final fight folks! Both fighters from Class 1-A have shown their prowess throughout the day, but now it’s time to see who’s the best! Izuku Midoriya,  And Katsuki Bakugou, the bellowing, bombastic blonde!”**

Izuku stepped up onto the ring for the final time, releasing a shaky breath as he saw Katsuku smile wickedly across from him.

“Back at Battle Training, you said you weren’t afraid of me. I saw it then, and I can see it now. You lied.” Katsuki sneered, bending his knees and getting himself ready. “And I’m gonna prove it. Prove all of it. Prove that quirk or not, you’re still just a fucking useless waste of space. No capture tape, no teachers to stop it.”

Izuku took in a deep, shaky breath, “Maybe you’re right. Maybe I did lie.” Izuku got ready, too, One For All sparking off of his skin. “...But that all changes today.”

**“BEGIN!”**
