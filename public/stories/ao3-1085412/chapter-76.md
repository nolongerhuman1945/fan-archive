"I SURRENDER!" Caro yelled, breathless with laughter from the strong tickling spell Harry had thrown at her.

It was all Bill could do to avoid Harry's rope spell as he tried not to laugh himself silly at the sight of her writhing on the floor of the Room of Requirement.

He skidded behind a nearby sofa and sent a stunner in Harry's direction. Harry dived over a chair to safety and the stunner impacted the furniture sending it flying.

Harry cast another stunner towards Bill who managed to duck and land a summoning spell on Caro who slid across the floor to him. He immediately cast a 'finite' and she stopped laughing, swiping at her wet face as she gasped for breath.

Bill shot up some sparks. "End! That's enough for today!"

Harry didn't move from his position but he stopped casting. "What's the white flag phrase?"

Bill grinned. In one of their first duels Bill had hit Harry with a hex after he called time. He'd pointed out the Death Eaters weren't going to play fair and Harry was going to need to be cautious if anyone called time or surrendered in a duel.

"Red is my colour." Bill yelled.

Harry stepped out and Bill stood up, offering a hand to Caro.

Caro took it gratefully. She shot Harry a disgruntled look. "You overpowered that tickling spell."

Harry shook his head and grinned at her. "Took you down and out."

"Damn it." Caro swore, brushing down her black pants.

"It was a good tactic." Bill allowed. "You alright, Caro?"

"Just my pride." Caro admitted ruefully. She brushed a lock of hair out of her eyes.

Bill was suddenly very aware that Caro was wearing very tight black leggings, a cropped top and nothing else but trainers. She was sweaty and damp and very appealing…

Harry cleared his throat.

Bill flushed and turned back to the now smirking teen. "Alright, Harry, what could you have done diff…"

A loud bang echoed through the school and for a second it seemed as though Hogwarts trembled.

"What the hell was that?" demanded Caro.

Bill caught Harry as he charged for the door. "Stay behind me!" He knew it was useless to argue for the teen to stay in the room. "Sirius will have my head if you just go running out."

Harry nodded briskly.

They opened the door and peeked into the corridor. It all looked normal but the portrait across the corridor was empty.

Bill gripped his wand and marched forward to the window. He gazed out and caught sight of smoke. It was the infirmary!

"All students to their common rooms! All students to their House common rooms!" Dumbledore's voice sounded through the school, concern and worry evident in the amplified tone.

"The infirmary's on fire." Bill informed Harry and Caro in a clipped voice. "We'd better get you back to your rooms, Harry!"

"You go help," Harry said quickly, "Caro can walk me back."

Caro nodded and pushed Bill a touch. "Go!"

Bill gave her a quick glance of gratitude and ran for the infirmary. He made his way down stairs and down corridors until he came to the infirmary doors. Minerva and Filius were already there casting. He swore at the smoke seeping out from under them. He joined them, recognising the wand movements as a charm to hold back fire and one to transfigure the door to glass so they could see inside.

"Where's everyone else?" Bill demanded as he added a charm to dispel the smoke shooting it under the door.

"The Headmaster is outside dealing with the structural damage and holding the wards." Minerva said sharply.

"Helen, Poppy and four students are inside." Filius fretted.

Running feet caused Bill to spin around, wand drawn to deal with the threat. He was pleased to see Sirius and Snape.

"Moody's gone to assist the Headmaster." Snape told the others.

Suddenly the wood became glass and they all peered through and froze.

The left outer wall of the infirmary was just cracked down the centre, light seeping in from the sun outside, and the crack travelled all the way across the floor to the inner sanctum of the infirmary. The inner wall was ablaze; smoke and flames creating a wall of fire.

"There!" Sirius pointed with his wand.

Underneath a bed as far from the blaze as possible were the huddled forms of Poppy and two students.

Bill and Sirius looked at each other and raised their wands in unison. Bill cast Bubbleheads on them both as Sirius vanished the doors in a rush of powerful magic that thrummed through the air.

They dived in, peripherally aware of Snape, Minerva and Filius shifting to cast spells that would hold the heat and smoke back from them.

Sirius banished anything in their path and they soon skidded to a halt, kneeling down to get under the bed.

It was damp to the touch and Bill realised Poppy must have drenched it in water trying to keep it from going up in flames.

"Take the children!" Poppy ordered, pushing the two Second Years at them.

Sirius took the girl who was crying hysterically, and Bill grabbed hold of the lad.

"We'll be back for you in a moment, Poppy." Sirius informed her sternly.

Bill cast a Bubblehead over her and her expression eased with relief. She nodded.

They hurried back across the room and deposited the students with Minerva, who ushered the youngsters away along the corridor.

"Hurry!" Filius shouted. "We can't hold this!"

"Get Poppy!" Sirius ordered immediately, hurrying to Snape's side and helping with the suppression magic.

Bill charged back into the infirmary, running full tilt to reach the end of the ward. Poppy saw him and started inching out from under the bed. He grabbed hold of her and shushed her as he picked her up.

As he made his way back, the crack groaned and the windows shattered in a storm of deadly glass particles.

Bill knew he wouldn't get a shield up in time; knew Sirius, Filius and Snape could not come to his aid…

He moved, placing his back to the windows, covering Poppy as much as he could while she protested weakly…

And nothing hit him.

He looked up astonished.

"GET MOVING, YOU GREAT PILLOCK!" Caro yelled from the doorway. Her wand was out and he knew immediately it had been her who had shielded him.

Bill stood, adjusted his hold on Poppy and hurried through. The three other wizards followed him with alacrity.

"You must go back!" Poppy said urgently, pushing Minerva away when she tried to start a diagnostic charm. "Helen was in the private examination room with two Hufflepuff students!"

Bill set her down on a nearby bench and went back to Sirius who was at the doorway examining the lay of the land. He shook his head. "There's no way through here!"

Poppy gave a cry.

Suddenly, a blue wave of magical energy, singing with the signature of Albus Dumbledore, swept over them and into the infirmary. It smothered the flames and destroyed the smoke leaving only silence and the devastation of the fire behind.

"Thank Merlin!" Minerva muttered, pushing the hair that had escaped her do back. Her hand squeezed Poppy's shoulder comfortingly. "Sirius, Helen…"

Bill checked with Sirius in a silent look and they both headed back in. Bill was aware Snape was following them.

The charred and melted contents were grim to look at with the crumbling inner walls shocking in their destruction. They moved carefully through the half-collapsed doorway into the small corridor with the private rooms.

It was suddenly clear where the fire had originated; a room at the end of the crack was black at the door. A quick peek inside and Bill gagged.

The room had been blown to bits and burned. The shape of something on what had been the bed was a small piled of ash. Cracks spider-webbed across ceiling and floor; one of the inner walls was half-gone.

Sirius gripped his wand tighter. "This was the elf's room." He performed a spell that Bill recognised from the Auror handbook; forensic detection. "The explosive device was in here but there's only elf magic present."

"Crouch." Snape snarled and Bill was reminded how Crouch had used his elf to terrorise Harry the Summer before.

Sirius nodded grimly. "He must have secured another elf and decided he didn't need her anymore."

Snape pointed his wand down the corridor. "Down here."

The first private examination room was empty; the second the same; the third had evidence of being used but was also empty.

Sirius pursed his lips and cast an Auror detection spell. "Portkey was used."

Bill nodded, and wiped his brow. "That means they're safe, right?"

Snape nodded slowly. "I am uncertain how they circumvented the portkey ward though."

Bill sighed in relief.

Two elves popped in and started setting the examination room to rights. They carefully made their way out and found the bedraggled group of Professors in the corridor was bereft of Poppy, Minerva and the students, and had been joined by the Headmaster and Moody.

"We think Doctor Jordan portkeyed out?" asked Sirius quickly.

"The ward was momentarily disrupted around the infirmary due to the explosion. Doctor Jordan carries a portkey to the Valley clinic for emergencies and thus will have arrived there with her two charges." Dumbledore confirmed gravely. "They will return in a week."

"That's something." Sirius said not hiding his relief. "Poppy?"

"Minor injuries." Dumbledore replied. "Along with her two charges. Minerva has taken them to the secondary infirmary by the Great Hall. She was going to summon a healer from Saint Mungo's to attend them." He gave a heavy sigh. "The explosion damaged the fire ward but it is now re-established. All the other wards have held and the damage is mostly superficial. The elves will have everything fixed by tomorrow. We will need the potions supply replenished but we can apply to Saint Mungo's for an emergency source."

"I assume the DMLE is on its way." Sirius turned to Moody who nodded. "You'll want to tell them that there was an explosive device left in the elf's room by another elf. I know damned well it wasn't Dobby so…"

"So Crouch has procured another to his dirty work." Moody growled.

"And hide his identity." Snape said smoothly.

Dumbledore cleared his throat. "Posey?"

An elf appeared immediately.

"I believed the wards have restricted all elves but Hogwart elves. Are you aware of any others that have been within the school?" Dumbledore asked gently.

"Many student elvsies come and go. Elvsies of students are considered Hogwarty elvsies, Master Dumbleydore." Posey answered immediately, her ears waggling.

"Merlin's bloody balls!" Moody exploded.

"Alastor!" Dumbledore began remonstratively, "there is a lady…"

"You've got that right, Moody." Caro agreed.

"Is there a chance that this isn't just about getting rid of the elf?" Moody asked Snape.

Snape's shoulders moved in an elegant shrug. "He's insane. Anything is possible."

Moody's expression turned even grimmer. "We need to check all the classrooms and common areas. He may have had his elf plant more explosives."

Dumbledore nodded gravely. "Posey, have the elves check for anything that may explode and report it to Professor Moody at once, and restrict access to Hogwarts to elves of the school and the Black elves only."

Her large head bobbed and she disappeared.

"I'd better go collect my son before he wears the carpet out with his pacing." Sirius said.

"Thank you, Sirius, and you, William." Dumbledore's eyes twinkled at them. "Your help was most appreciated."

Bill fell into step beside Sirius and smiled when Caro moved to Sirius's other side. She winked at him and he grinned appreciatively at her. He'd have to think about buying her a thank you for the shield – maybe a night out at that cinema thing she'd introduced him to? The big screen with its enormous photo detailing a story. It was tremendous. Sounded like a plan to him.

"All students will gather in the Great Hall for lunch! There will be announcements! All students…" Dumbledore's voice sounded again.

Bill tuned out Sirius's complaints that the Headmaster had done that on purpose knowing Sirius was on his way to Harry, and turned his mind back to his future plans.

o-O-o

Barty found it hard to cackle wildly as he followed the rest of the Ravenclaws to their table. He settled himself down between the Sixth form and a place from Natalie Warren, certain that no-one would notice him in the shade of the captivating Head Girl.

He ignored the heated whisperings as the table debated what had happened and what it meant. He watched instead as the Gryffindors filed in, Potter among them with his hand clasped to an elf's. Barty controlled his features. It was the elf that had seen to Winky and clearly it was Potter's own elf. Shame his explosion hadn't caught the little vermin.

Black hurried in along with the Weasley Heir and a blonde shapely woman who garnered more than one stare for her skimpy attire. Potter sprang up to greet them and they joined him on the Gryffindor table.

The staff swept in but remained standing in front of their seats; Moody and McGonagall were missing along with the infirmary staff.

Dumbledore waited for quiet before he spoke. "Thank you. It's my grave duty to inform you that the infirmary was attacked today. We believe the perpetrator to be Bartemius Crouch Junior. The DMLE is on site and searching the grounds but we believe Mister Crouch used an elf and thus will not be found easily."

Barty preened. He had done such a good job.

Mutterings broke out across the hall.

"Doctor Jordan and Madame Pomfrey are both safe as are the four students who were in their care. Unfortunately, an elf in the care of the school was killed." Dumbledore announced.

Silence settled again except for a pitiful wail from the elf by Potter.

"The secondary infirmary is located by the Hall through the chamber door behind me." Dumbledore waved and a set of doors identical to the ones that opened up to the infirmary appeared. "It will be used for at least a few days until we can verify the main infirmary has been repaired and properly outfitted."

Barty grimaced. He had once read about the secondary infirmary in *Hogwarts: A History* but had thought it would have fallen out of use. No matter. His explosion had caused damage and it had served its purpose.

"Lunch will now be served and classes will resume this afternoon." Dumbledore intoned before leaving, the food appearing on the tables in his wake.

Barty ducked his head as the rest of the table erupted in a storm of debate. He reached instead for the shepherd's pie by his elbow. The afternoon would be busy and he would need a good meal.

o-O-o

Harry took his place in the Potions lab with a sigh. He actually enjoyed the brewing of potions but he hated Snape's tutelage. Hermione gave him a smile when he turned around to look at her and Harry smiled back. He'd just returned his face to the front when Snape stormed in with his usual swirling robes.

"You may be assured this classroom has been examined and no explosive device found." Snape sneered. He snapped his wand at the board and the ingredients for a simple Calming Draught appeared. "Our infirmary is in need of potions and I expect perfection." He sneered. "Two hours; you may begin."

Harry immediately doubled checked the instructions with the book he had opened up and confirmed they were the same. He reviewed his potion ingredients and was pleased to find everything at hand. He set out his cauldron, checked its cleanliness and manually wiped it, the stirrer and the knife he would use down with a cloth. Beside him, Neville was following the same steps.

Snape stalked past, his dark eyes glared at them briefly.

Harry and Neville exchanged a rueful look and turned their attention back to the potion.

The act of chopping and measuring was almost soothing. Cooking was something he had almost enjoyed at the Dursleys although he'd hated doing it only for his own portion to be meagre. He carefully peeled his Bay root and added it to his cauldron with enough water to cover.

He was glad the classrooms had been searched because he didn't believe in his gut that Crouch would stop at killing Winky. It seemed all too coincidental that the very day the potion was going to be ready to wake the Summers lady that Crouch would choose to strike at the elf.

He had asked Sirius if the potion was safe at lunch and Sirius had promised to check with Snape. Presumably that accounted for why the Professor had been late, in a grumpy mood, and made it a point to say the classroom was safe.

Dobby was devastated at the death of Winky.

He'd been crying and wailing and it had taken a good few minutes for Harry to settle him down so he could make any sense of the elf's words. Harry had reassured Dobby he hadn't failed in his task to look after Winky. Thankfully Dobby had agreed to join the other elves in the search for more explosives and seemed grateful to be doing something useful.

Harry was actually thankful that Snape had given them something useful to do too; brewing potions to replace those lost was a good idea.

Suddenly Peeves appeared in the classroom just underneath the high ceiling. "Balloons!" The poltergeist cackled and dropped the armful of brightly coloured spheres he held. He disappeared again hooting madly.

"SHEILD YOUR CAULDRONS!" Snape ordered.

While his classmates all responded, hurrying to throw shields around their equipment, Harry instead pointed his wand at the floor and erected the duelling shield.

It travelled up and up…

The balloons drifted down and down…

The ward was almost there…

And the first balloon hit the invisible shield with a squelch.

Lavender screamed; Parvati following as balloon after balloon hit the duelling ward and liquid exploded over the top of the dome.

"POTTER MAKE A HOLE! OUT!" Snape yelled. "EVERYONE OUT!"

Harry concentrated and formed a small hole in the shield at the door. He took a deep breath, maintaining the ward but keeping an opening was hard work even for someone with his power.

Snape hurried people through, including an anxious Hermione, until there was only Snape and Harry left in the classroom. Snape waved his wand and the door slammed shut sealing them inside.

"Get under the lab table and don't let any of the potion touch you." Snape ordered briskly, following his own instructions by gathering his robes around him and beginning to lower himself to the floor. "On the count of three let go of the shield and erect a Bubblehead."

Harry nodded his acquiescence, straining to maintain the shield against the liquid potion.

"One…"

Harry dropped to the floor and crawled under the table.

"Two…"

He focused on his wand on maintaining the shield until…

"Three!"

Harry dropped the shield and attempted the Bubblehead charm only for it to immediately wobble and collapse. He frowned.

The potion fell, splattering over the classroom haphazardly. Where it hit the open cauldrons, it sizzled ominously.

But where it simply landed was worse. It hit the ground and turned into a white vapour.

Harry's eyes widened and he tried to cast another Bubblehead before it reached him. As the second failed, he realised that he didn't have enough room under the table to get his wand movements right, but before he could try a third time, the vapour hit him.

He gave a cry as his body started to change…

"Potter! We need to get moving! The alarm has triggered on my private laboratory and…" Snape stood up and walked towards him.

Harry's writhing threw him clear of the table into the aisle. Snape stopped and Harry squinted up at him.

Snape looked at him aghast, his head sealed into a Bubblehead. "You're…you're…"

Harry looked at his fur covered hands and snarled. "Animagus. Potion…making me!" He managed to get out. "Can't control it…leave!" And suddenly he couldn't stop the transformation any longer.

His body arched and his clothing tore…

He landed on four huge tawny paws, threw back his head and roared.

Snape turned heel and ran; he slammed the door shut behind him and locked it.

Harry hit the door with a thud.

A small part of Harry knew he was a lion; that he'd changed but was still a human underneath the fur, claws and teeth. A larger part of him still under the potions' thrall was simply a huge predatory animal incensed at being trapped. He threw himself at the door again.

What was he doing?

His human brain demanded the answer from the animal.

The animal snarled and went to launch itself for a third time at the door.

Stupid.

Mindless.

Why just throw himself at the door?

What was *that* going to do?

Apart from hurt because throwing himself at the door *hurt*.

And just like that Harry's mind shook off the thrall just as it had shaken away the compulsion on the ring.

The lion sat back on his haunches and huffed.

Alright, Harry mused, he should have a go at transforming back to a human. He closed his eyes and reached…

Nothing.

He pondered the situation. He remembered that the werewolves had been in their forms for another twenty-four hours after inhaling the potion. Maybe this was a variant? He could only hope. He gave an unhappy huff and sank down to the ground.

He was fairly certain that the potion vapour was no longer potent. The vents in the potion lab were spelled to counter anything harmful within a few minutes; sucking it into a magical space where it would be neutralised before shunting whatever was left into the air outside. There was nothing to do until someone came to let him out.

The lion in him didn't like to wait as his wildly lashing tail gave away.

Harry roared and dropped his head to his paws.

o-O-o

Severus slammed shut the lab door behind him and spelled it locked. A heavy thud against the door proved his intelligence and instinct was sound. He whirled around and found himself facing a horde of worried students.

"You've *left* Harry in there?!" Granger demanded hotly.

"He's been exposed to a potion to turn him into a mindless beast." Severus snapped out. "Get Black down here to deal with him! I have something to check elsewhere!"

He left them agape at his terseness and seeming lack of care for a student but it couldn't be helped. The alarm on his private ward meant someone was in his quarters; in his private lab.

It was Crouch.

It had to be.

He was after the antidote potion. It was the only explanation. The mad wizard had already removed one threat in the elf, it made sense that he'd use the chaos of the day to attempt to remove the second.

Severus hurried down the short cut through the dungeons, a curl of guilt wrapping itself around his spine about Potter. Black was best placed to deal with Potter, he assured himself. At least they'd gotten the rest of the students out before they'd turned into animals. He shuddered at the thought of being trapped in a locked lab filled with feral beasts.

He charged down another corridor and saw the door to his quarters was ajar. He was about to take a step toward it when the Headmaster appeared beside him in a rush of flames. Fawkes arrowed up to perch on a rafter leaving Albus behind. The old wizard gestured toward the room.

"Shall we?" Albus asked quietly, low enough that his voice would not carry.

Severus nodded, relieved beyond words that Albus would be with him. He took a deep breath and walked forward.

o-O-o

Sirius stormed down the dungeon corridor. He thanked Merlin Hermione had enough common sense for a dozen teenagers. She had called for Dobby and the elf had immediately informed Sirius of the situation.

He banked the worry he had for Harry behind the anger that was percolating about Snape. The greasy bat just couldn't help himself, Sirius thought angrily. What was Snivellus doing leaving Sirius's potioned son alone in a lab?

He turned the corner and saw the huddle of students in front of the lab. Hermione was trying to unlock the door and Sirius did grudgingly give Snape credit for ensuring the kids were protected from their own curiosity; Hermione definitely lived up to her animagus form at times.

Sirius cleared his throat loudly.

It was almost amusing how their heads snapped up and around to look at him in unison.

"Cousin," Draco greeted him formally, "Professor Snape said he had something to check…"

"He just left Harry in there!" Ron interrupted heatedly.

"That's not important right now," Hermione remonstrated with the boys, "we have to get Harry out!"

"The Professor said he was a mindless beast!" Draco retorted. "He wouldn't lie about that!"

Sirius took a deep breath. Snape probably did have a good reason for leaving and his description of Harry was a tad worrying. What a day! He held up his hand, commanding immediate silence.

"Everyone away from the door." He pointed down the corridor. "I want you all to wait at the end of the corridor."

Hermione looked mutinous but she moved away and the others followed her. Sirius turned back to the door and performed a scan that allowed him to assess what was beyond. It was a very useful Auror spell.

The results almost made him smile.

Harry was in an animal form but he seemed to have settled down, lying on the floor some distance away from the door. There was no sign of any active potion. Sirius figured that there was no harm in being cautious and ran another scan. The ventilation system had activated a few minutes before, drawing out a toxic potion vapour. He frowned but unlocked the door.

Sirius entered carefully. Harry might seem docile but the words 'mindless beast' echoed in his head. He peeked into the lab.

The young lion lying by the desk looked incredibly sorry for itself. Its head was resting on its paws, ears flat, black mane a wild mess, and there was a sorrowful look in its bright green eyes.

Sirius shuffled inside the room and closed the door. "Harry?"

Harry growled, glanced down at his paws and back up at Sirius.

"Yes, you're a lion." Sirius confirmed. He did his best to hide his amusement. "I'm assuming since you're not attacking me you're completely in control of your form?"

Harry huffed.

Sirius gave a sigh of relief. His eyes landed on a shredded balloon, a sticky yellow potion still clinging to the rubbery inner surface. He waved his wand and an evidence box appeared; a moment later, the remnants of all the balloons were safely secured.

"Well, we'll have that analysed later." Sirius said. "Come on. We should get you somewhere safer than a compromised lab."

Harry got to his feet and stretched, his sizeable claws scratching the stone flooring. Sirius winced at the sound. He was pleased that Harry just padded over to him. The urge to reach out and pat his head was strong but Sirius resisted. The lion wasn't a form Harry had chosen; it was a form he had been forced into and even if he had his faculties, there was no point tempting fate.

o-O-o

Severus looked carefully around the room from his place just inside the doorway.

The living space looked undisturbed. The same book on potions rested on the side table where he had left it the night before; the wards on his book shelves were intact. The small kitchen area was clean and tidy. His bedroom door was closed.

The door to the lab was open.

Albus waved him back and strode ahead, marching into the space like the Gryffindor he was. Severus rolled his eyes and followed him.

They both came to a halt in the doorway, watching as a Ravenclaw student poured acid into the potion that Severus had readied for the Summers woman.

"Hello, Severus! And the Headmaster! How delightful!" The boy cooed without taking his eyes off the ruined potion. He set the acid down.

"Hello Mister Pinner," Albus responded, "or should I say Mister Crouch?"

Barty giggled. "Ah, I'm afraid you've caught me red-handed." He pouted and looked at Severus. "You will forgive me, Severus, but I just cannot allow you to complete this potion!"

Severus glowered at him. In the presence of Albus, he could free his hatred for the snivelling little wretch, rather than have to pretend a camaraderie because they both served the Dark Lord. "You foolish cretin!" He sneered. "You think the Dark Lord will be happy with you? You're wrong; you're caught!"

"Where is Mister Pinner?" Albus asked, drawing Crouch's attention.

Barty pouted. "Oh he's safe enough." His eyes gleamed with smug triumph. "I'd be willing to tell you where he is if you'd give me the location of the lovely Ms Summers!"

"I'm afraid I won't trade one life for another." Albus said firmly, his blue eyes flinty.

"Perhaps he'll be more cooperative once the Aurors have him back in Azkaban." Severus sneered, his fingers gripped his wand tightly.

"I'll come quietly!" Barty proclaimed, batting his eyes innocently.

"I rather think that's a lie, Mister Crouch." Albus said conversationally.

Barty twirled Pinner's wand. "Of course it's a lie."

And the room behind them exploded.

o-O-o

"Oh isn't he cute!" Lavender cooed.

Harry's ears slapped back on his head, revealing just how pleased he was at *that* comment.

Sirius coughed, and Harry's superb feline hearing caught the laugh that underscored the sound. He glared at his father.

"I don't think Harry likes being called cute." Ron commented stiffly to his ex-girlfriend.

"He's a lion." Draco commented flatly. "He's about as cute and cuddly as a…"

"He's adorable." Lavender insisted.

"He's an apex predator capable of taking down an entire elephant." Hermione corrected her sharply.

"I hardly think that's possible." Draco argued.

Harry roared his displeasure, effectively silencing them all.

Sirius grinned. "Right, I think that's Harry Lion Speak for 'I'd like to vacate this corridor and I'm not cute.'" He ignored Harry's green glare. "I'm taking Harry back to our quarters and he'll stay there until the potion wears off…"

"But he's supposed to be spending the night in the dorm!" Ron protested.

"He can do the next weekend when he's not a lion instead." Sirius countered. "You lot should head to your common rooms."

"Shouldn't someone inform the Headmaster?" asked Hermione, folding her arms and looking mutinous once again.

Sirius waved his hand dismissively. "Snape's probably already got it covered but I'll send word once I get Harry back to…"

BOOM!

The corridor rocked with the explosion.

"Common rooms NOW!" Harry heard Sirius ordering the others, urgency spilling into every word, but Harry was already running. "HARRY!"

Harry gave into the primal urge flooding him; his prey was close and he needed to find him even if that meant running towards the explosion rather than away. He was aware the moment Sirius shifted into Padfoot, the following footsteps turning into bounding, scrabbling paws.

"ALL STUDENTS REMAIN IN YOUR CLASSROOMS!" The harried voice of his Aunt Minerva echoed through the school.

Harry skidded round one corner, then another, running, running…

Flames brought him to a furious halt and he lurched to a stop, only millimetres from getting his fur singed.

Harry snarled and paced, glowering through the flames. Just as Sirius bounded up, Harry caught a flash of a black cloak flashing through the flames. He roared and…

Sirius became a wizard in a blink…

Harry leaped as the flames were doused hurriedly with magic from his father's wand. Harry was barely aware; he charged after the Ravenclaw who was escaping on a broomstick, flying ahead pf him.

The boy glanced behind and saw Harry chasing after him. He gave an insane laugh and pushed the broom harder.

Harry redoubled his efforts, heart pounding as he ran hard to keep up. The broom was a good quality one but it was hampered by the tight corners and narrow corridors in the dungeons. It wasn't a surprise to Harry that the student was heading for the main staircase. He just hoped that the students were staying in the classrooms out of harm's way.

The Ravenclaw suddenly took a left, darting into a side corridor and up a short staircase towards an entrance Harry recognised…it led to the Astronomy tower.

He pushed himself harder to catch up, up the stairs…

…round another corner…

…the broomstick just ahead, a flash of black cloak again…

…stairs…

…corner…

…the broomstick's twigs were almost there in front of him…

…stairs…

…corner…

…light ahead!

And Harry launched himself forward, paw stretching…

The twigs of the broomstick snapped under his furious swipe, sending the broomstick spiralling wildly, dumping its rider onto the tower…

Harry landed awkwardly but he was on his feet in a trice.

The student scrambled upright and blurred for a moment as the Polyjuice faded away…leaving a gleeful looking Bartemius Crouch Junior in its wake.

Harry's chest heaved as he fought for breath, his head lowered itself automatically, ears back and tail flicking madly as he stared at his prey…

Crouch twirled his wand. "Well, well, well. Look at the pretty kitty-cat! Here's me with a wand and you without!"

Harry bared his teeth to hide his alarm as he realised Crouch was right. Apart from the teeth and claws, he had no real defences as a lion.

Crouch took a step back toward the edge of the parapet. "I could hogtie you and take you to Father but…" he appeared to ponder the matter for a moment, "…but no. If you're who I think you are – and really that mess of hair is a give-away - you really do have to stick around here for the third task." He grinned madly. "Can't have an ingredient spoiling at this late stage!"

Harry growled low in his throat; a warning.

"I guess I'll just have to settle for some minor maiming." Crouch lifted his wand and snapped off a bright purple spell.

Harry leaped out of the way of it…ending up by the right wall, trapped…

"Crucio!" Crouch yelled.

The spell slammed into a suddenly conjured slab of rock.

Crouch's head snapped around to the door to the tower's roof; his face contorted into hatred. "Black!"

Sirius stalked onto the roof and Crouch took another step back…

"Get away from my son!" Sirius snarled.

"You can't keep him safe, Black!" Crouch smiled nastily. "You never could! The Dark Lord will get him in the end!"

"Your Dark Lord is a craven coward who attacked a baby." Sirius snapped, inching closer to Harry, his wand never wavering from Crouch. "Give up, Crouch! Put your wand down slowly and your hands behind your head!"

Crouch giggled, high and loudly. "You think I'm going to give myself up to *you*? You'll pay for what you did to Rab! I'm going to destroy you, Black!"

"On the ground, Crouch!" Sirius had reached Harry, and Harry pressed against his legs, reassuring his father, he was fine.

"NEVER!" Crouch shouted. "Reparo! Accio!" He took a step back and jumped from the tower…

The broomstick cracked into pristine condition and zoomed over the edge.

Sirius shot out a red stunner but it missed Crouch who had managed to snag the broom and was flying away.

Harry lifted his head and roared.

"Bugger!" Sirius swore roundly. He sighed and looked down at Harry.

Harry cringed, his ears flattening again, as he waited for the inevitable blistering lecture.

"You're not exactly *you* right now and you're mostly working off animal instincts," Sirius allowed, "so I'm going to give you a pass on running after a crazed madman alone, the same crazed madman for that matter, for the second time in a year…but so help you if you try it for a third time! You understand me, Harry!"

Harry gave as much of a sheepish nod as he could in his lion form.

"Come on." Sirius said with another sigh. "You need to get safe inside our rooms and I need to go find out what's happened to Snape. His quarters looked like a bomb had hit them."

Harry followed his father down from the tower, glancing behind him one last time at the empty sky – Crouch was long gone.

o-O-o

It took longer than Sirius liked before he'd ushered a rather dejected lion into their quarters and hurried back to the dungeons.

A gaggle of Professors and Aurors stood around the door to Snape's quarters. They were all fiercely arguing about what was to be done.

Sirius was ignored as he edged his way around the group and into the room.

It was bad.

The bookshelves were intact at least; the wards had held. The rest of the furniture was pretty much kindling; side tables consigned to splinters; the sofa was a ruined wreck that had clearly been alight. The blast had originated from a door to the back of the rooms; Snape's bedroom, Sirius surmised.

The bedraggled Potions Professor stood in front of the scorched entry gazing into the ruin of his private room.

"Snape?" Sirius called softly walking up to stand a touch behind. The glimpse of the blackened and gutted room beyond his old childhood foe had him wincing.

Snape turned to him. He was dripping wet and looked devastated. "He ruined the antidote in the lab."

"And demolished your quarters by the looks of things." Sirius said crisply, careful to keep any hint of pity out of his voice and his expression.

"My books survived." Snape said almost absently, his attention returning to the bedroom.

"Have you been seen by a healer, Snape?" asked Sirius, concerned at Snape's demeanour.

"They had to check the Headmaster first. He saved us." Snape said in an almost confused tone. "They took him away."

Sirius carefully reached out and rested a hand on Snape's shoulder. "Come along then. We need to get you to the infirmary."

Snape let himself be led out almost docilely. It was unnerving.

Dawlish stopped them as Sirius guided Snape into the corridor. "Hey, where are you taking him?"

"Dawlish!" Shacklebolt remonstrated swiftly. "Apologies, Lord Black, but…"

"I asked the Aurors to investigate as they were already on site for the infirmary bombing." Minerva cut in, glaring at them both.

"A wise decision, and I'll be happy to provide a statement regarding Bartemius Crouch Junior's escape." Sirius said formally. "However, Professor Snape is in some shock. I'm taking him to the infirmary."

Alastor gave Sirius an approving nod. "Hogwarts is on lockdown, lad."

Sirius gave an answering nod. That was good. At least they could be certain as they could be that Voldemort's main agent was gone from the castle and couldn't return. They'd start a concerted search for the cabinet. It had to be hidden somewhere.

He led Snape through to the Great Hall and the secondary infirmary. It felt strange for Pomfrey not to be the one bustling in and ordering them into a bed; the young male Healer who approached seemed far too junior.

"Oh good!" The healer said chirpily. "I was going to return to see to the Professor but it's good you've brought him."

"He's in shock." Sirius informed him briskly.

"Of course he is."

Snape and Sirius exchanged an incredulous look which was quickly dropped as they realised they had just looked to each other in silent conversation.

"Drink this!" The healer bundled a blue potion into Snape's hand and Snape drank it down.

Sirius recognised it as a calming potion; it would alleviate the physical symptoms of shock and provide a mild cheering charm.

"Some bruising and scrapes but otherwise fine." The healer tutted, wand weaving in charms that would reduce swelling and heal the surface damage to the skin. "And we need to get you out of these wet clothes!"

In a flash Snape was stripped and redressed in infirmary pyjamas. He was cleaned and dried with another spell before he was ushered into a bed like a recalcitrant student and the healer left through a side door.

"Well, this is mortifying." Snape muttered, plucking at the coverlet.

"Severus! Sirius! Is that you?" Albus called from behind a portable screen.

Sirius moved the screen revealing the Headmaster in striped pyjamas also tucked into bed although he was sitting, propped up by a mountain of fluffy pillows.

Snape shifted, sitting up and putting his own meagre one pillow behind his back. Sirius resisted the urge to find him more.

"How are you, Albus?" asked Sirius, concerned.

"Just some bumps and bruises." Albus replied cheerfully, the drugged glaze of his blue eyes giving away that he was probably under a dose of the same potion as Snape. "Young Mister Crouch should get detention, I think."

Sirius exchanged another fleeting glance of worry with Snape. "I think prison would be a better idea."

"Or death." Snape suggested bitterness dripping from his tone.

Sirius couldn't argue with that. "Did you find out who he was impersonating? When I got to him he was back to his own ugly mug; all I could tell was that he was a Ravenclaw."

"Pinner." Snape said tersely. "Minerva informed Moody. An Auror was dispatched to check on his residence."

"Good." Sirius said and wondered if they'd be too late to save the boy. "What a day." He rubbed his forehead tiredly.

"I assume Potter is still an overgrown feline?" asked Snape briskly.

"Yep, still a lion when I dropped him off at our rooms." Sirius admitted, refusing to get riled at the way Snape had phrased his question. "But he was in control of himself more." He motioned backward. "I have the remnants of the potion secured. You can take a look, uh, when you're up and about and the elves have fixed your lab."

"The lab is intact." Snape said. "He destroyed the potion thoroughly but his aim was petty destruction of my property not wholesale destruction of my work." He folded his arms. "I'm certain he only left it alone in case I had other work for the Dark Lord in motion of which he was unaware."

"Well, I guess that's…good?" Sirius fumbled a reply.

Snape snorted and Sirius couldn't blame him.

"We will replace anything of value." Albus said brightly. "We do have an emergency fund for these situations."

And Sirius could see that it received an additional donation to help.

"I keep everything of real value at my home. There was nothing of particular value here except the books and…" Snape caught himself and stopped, a hint of blush streaking across his sallow face.

"And?" prompted Sirius.

Snape glowered at him. "Nothing you would understand."

Sirius turned away and rolled his eyes. "We need to find the vanishing cabinet he left behind."

"Yes, but the wards will alert me now to anyone entering without due notice. Alastor has assured me of that." Albus said cheerily.

Just how much of that potion had Albus been given, wondered Sirius.

"I'm afraid though between the loss of the house-elf and the ruined potion that Mister Crouch has achieved his objective in keeping us from finding out what Tom does not want us to know." Albus continued in the same bright tone. "It is most vexing."

"Vexing." Sirius agreed, refusing to share another commiserating look with Snape.

"I don't see the issue." Snape argued, pulling Sirius's attention back to him anyway.

"You don't see the issue with what's happened today?" Sirius said disbelievingly. Maybe Snape was more traumatised than the healer had realised.

"I also find myself perplexed by your statement, Severus." Albus said. "The house-elf was admittedly a long shot and we know Tom never gave any explicit instruction to keep her silent. But he has worried about Mary Summers and we now have no way of waking her."

"Yes, we do." Snape argued.

"No," Albus said enunciating slowly and clearly, "we do not. The potion was lost, Severus. Have you forgotten?"

"I have not forgotten but the potion is not lost." Snape shot back.

"An acid was poured into it." Albus pointed out. "It rendered it useless."

"Yes but it is not *lost*." Snape replied with a sneer.

"Of course!" Albus crowed, brightening as the answer came to him. "You can remake it!"

"Too late for us to learn anything before the Third Task though." Sirius pointed out. But it would revive the woman and it would save her from a living death.

"I don't need to remake it." Snape countered huffily. "There is a portion of it in stasis at my home. I will have a house-elf fetch it. We can still revive the woman."

Sirius and Albus stared at him.

Snape squirmed under their regard. "I did say anything of value was at my home."

"Snape," Sirius said slowly, "don't take this the wrong way but I think I may have to kiss you."

Snape's eyes widened fantastically fast.

o-O-o

Remus paused, his nose wrinkling at the smell of charred wood. The door in front of him looked pristine. He sighed and knocked briefly before entering on the sneered command.

Whatever damage had been done to Severus's quarters had clearly been fixed. Remus couldn't see any of the damage that Sirius had told him about. The sofa was a sumptuous silver and green Paisley upholstery; the small wooden side tables gleamed with polished varnish. Remus followed his nose to the entry of the private lab.

Severus reluctantly rose from the armchair he inhabited, placing his book down and setting aside the fine china cup he held filled with fragrant tea. "Lupin."

"Severus." Remus said evenly, not reacting to the edge of distaste in Severus's voice. "It's good to see you well after yesterday's events."

"The Headmaster shielded me from the worst." Severus allowed almost grudgingly.

Remus nodded. Albus was still in Hogwarts' infirmary after the Healers had diagnosed him with magical exhaustion. It was a reminder that the Headmaster wasn't a young man and wouldn't live for ever.

"I didn't realise you were back in the country." Severus said, folding his arms huffily across his chest.

"I was coming back tomorrow." Remus explained. "When I heard what happened, I brought my travel plans forward."

"I was expecting Black." Severus stated bluntly.

Remus shrugged lightly. "He doesn't want to leave Harry when he's still in lion form."

Severus sniffed. "The potion will wear off before the end of the weekend."

"Sirius thought it might have been something similar to the werewolf potion?" Remus questioned, aiming for a casual tone.

Severus gave a huff and shook his head. "The werewolf potion is completely different." He lectured sternly. "*That* is a masterful example of how dangerous a potion may be." He paused. "I have started a counter but it will be some months before completion."

Remus gave a sigh of relief. "It's good to know there will be some way to stop or reverse it." He said. "Most of us hate changing; to have someone force us to do that with a potion when we can't even stop ourselves…" he shuddered. "I know my pack and I will happily test the antidotes for you, Severus."

"I will keep you in mind." Severus said.

"So if yesterday's potion wasn't related to the werewolf potion…" Remus let the end of the question trail away.

Severus grimaced. "A prank potion." He glared at Remus. "It was very similar to the one you used on Regulus in our sixth year."

"Ah." Remus remembered that. It had been a retaliatory pranking for Regulus trying to beat up his brother. They'd spiked his drink and turned him into a chicken for an hour.

"I believe the potion was designed to turn all the Gryffindor students into lions." Severus continued. "It would have left the Slytherin untouched to defend themselves."

It would have been a massacre either way, Remus thought. Either the Slytherins would have hurt and killed their Gryffindor year mates or vice versa.

"Potter did well to get the shield up." Severus said, looking grumpy at having to give Harry credit for anything.

"He's very talented." Remus said mildly.

Severus gave a snort and gestured for Remus to follow him through to the inner lab. "I assume you are here for the antidote potion?"

"Yes," Remus agreed, "I'm surprised you're not coming to the safe house though."

"It would be far too dangerous for me to attend if I am to retain deniability with the Dark Lord." Severus pointed out as he made his way across the lab.

Remus looked around with interest at the well-organised space. He was impressed and he had expected no less from a Potions Master of Severus's skills and reputation. "Sirius said Crouch left your lab intact."

"Just." Severus snapped. He pointed his wand at a cupboard and levitated a vial filled with a vibrant pink potion.

Remus took hold of it and made a face at the colour. It was very lurid. "How do we administer it?"

"Five drops on her tongue should be sufficient. If you find she has not roused, try one more drop every fifteen minutes up to a total of ten drops. If it hasn't worked at that point I will need to reassess my work." Severus instructed. "Do not administer it to Mister Pinner. I will have to do a full review of his blood work before I can verify that the same potion was used to keep him alive but unconscious."

"I understand." Remus had been surprised that the Aurors had managed to find Pinner alive, but he guessed that Crouch had been delayed in his exit by Sirius and Harry enough to reconsider returning to the Pinner house and killing the boy.

"If that is all, I am expected elsewhere." Severus said pointedly.

Remus nodded hurriedly. "Thank you, Severus."

He made his way out of Severus's quarters and through Hogwarts' maze of corridors to Moody's office.

Moody barely looked up from his marking when Remus entered. "How's your new missus?"

"In good spirits." Remus said, fondness at the mention of Dora stealing over him so swiftly he didn't even realise it. "She'll be arriving home tomorrow."

"And the sprog?" Moody asked as though uninterested.

"Doing well." Remus shook his head, thinking of just how much Dora was showing; the rounded curve of her belly filled with their child. "I can't believe how much time's gone by already."

Moody snorted. "Rather you than me." He waved a hand at the sheaf of papers. "This lots a bloody nightmare."

"You don't think you'll be signing on for another year then?" asked Remus curious. Harry raved about Moody's classes; all the kids did.

"Not bloody likely." Moody muttered. "I retired for peace and quiet! What do I get?"

Remus nodded. "I guess with the Tournament and Crouch's recent escapades it hasn't exactly been a quiet time."

Moody harrumphed. "Oh I can handle the Tournament and the hex bombs! It's the bloody kids asking questions and whining about essays I can't stand! 'But, Professor,'" he mimicked in a high voice, "'I accidentally turned my parchment into a dog!'"

Remus laughed.

Moody nodded toward the floo. "You'd best be off. Amelia's waiting for you."

"Thank you." Remus said, giving him a quick salute. He flooed through to the office of the Director of the DMLE and waved the soot away with a flash of his wand.

Amelia rose from her seat and Remus greeted her warmly even as his smile widened at the sight of her companion; Brian.

"I wasn't expecting to see you here!" Remus shook hands with the Black solicitor.

"The firm was appointed to protect Ms Summers' legal rights when she was taken into protective custody." Brian explained.

"Sensible." Remus said approvingly to Amelia.

"I rather thought so." Amelia said. A knock on the door had her breaking into a tense smile. "That will be the other members of our party."

The door swished open to reveal the head of the DOM and a plump old woman with grey hair.

"Bertie, Glenda." Amelia waved them inside and closed the door. She locked it and placed a privacy ward up. "Glenda Croaker, this is Remus Lupin. Remus, this is Glenda Croaker; a DOM Healer and Bertie's sister-in-law."

Remus was pleased when the Healer immediately offered her hand. He shook it warmly.

"Pleased to meet you." She said. "I take it you have the potion?"

Remus withdrew the pink vial from his robes. "This is it."

Amelia picked up a sock on her desk. "Hold onto it carefully. We're going to portkey to the safe house."

A moment later they all laid a finger on the sock and were pulled into the transportation's portal. They landed in a small back garden. It looked overgrown and weedy. Remus smelt salt in the air and a brief turn of his head brought the edge of a cliff and the sea beyond into view.

The cottage Amelia led them into was small. It was all one living space; a small kitchen area with an old fashioned low porcelain sink, a blackened Aga providing the heat, and a tiny seating area.

A young man thundered down the narrow stairs on the far wall and stopped in the centre of the space.

"Glenda! Brian! Directors!" His eyes landed suspiciously on Remus.

Amelia smiled. "Colin, this is Remus Lupin. He's here to represent Lord Black and Lord Potter. Remus, Colin Summers; Mary's brother."

"Nice to meet you." Remus said politely. "I have the potion that will wake your sister."

Colin's shoulders dropped and he pushed a hand through his sandy hair. "Thank you. Uh, what…"

"Mister Lupin and I will head up to your sister's room and administer the potion." Glenda stepped forward. "Once she is awake, I will thoroughly examine her. Only if I believe she is ready will she face questions."

"For which I will be present." Brian confirmed as Colin glanced over at him.

Remus let Glenda show him the way. The stairs were steep and narrow, and he had to duck his head at one point to avoid the ceiling beam. He was able to make out a tiny bathroom with old fixtures, an open door to a bedroom that looked half-lived in, before he entered a small room with a single bed occupied by Mary Summers.

The rounded swell of her belly, the covers not hiding her pregnant condition, brought to mind Dora and Remus shuddered thinking of how close she had come to ending up in Voldemort's hands the same way Summers had done.

He handed the potion to Glenda and gave her Snape's instructions. Five drops on the tongue later, and the comatose patient began to rouse. Remus left, heading back down the stairs. An elf bustled about the kitchen and soon pressed a cup of tea into Remus's hands. He conjured a chair in the absence of a spare one and sat down.

"It's worked." Remus confirmed to the anxious looking group. "She's coming round."

Her brother slumped back in his chair, relief written all over him.

"I meant to ask; how is Albus?" Bertie broke the silence, subtly changing the subject.

"Still confined to a hospital bed." Remus said.

"It's easy to forget how old he is." Brian commented. "Shielding himself and Snape at ground zero couldn't have been easy."

"I doubt many would have managed it." Amelia agreed. "Especially since he'd already expended a great deal of energy earlier that day bringing the infirmary incident under control."

"Do you think you could speak of something else?" blurted out Colin.

They all looked over at the nervous brother and silently acquiesced, turning the conversation to Quidditch and the latest gossip.

A creak on the stair drew their attention.

"She's awake." Glenda said.

Colin was on his feet and running up the stairs in a heartbeat. Amelia cleaned up the spilt tea with a wave of her wand. She followed more sedately and Remus motioned for Bertie and Brian to head up before him.

When he entered the bedroom for the second time he was pleased to find it had been expanded. A wan looking Mary Summers, blonde hair pulled back into a messy ponytail, sat upright, cushioned by a mound of pillows. Her brother sat beside her, and their hands were tightly clasped together on top of the covers.

"I will state this only once," Glenda said firmly, "should Ms Summers become distressed, I will call this to an end and evict you all. Does everyone understand?"

There was a chorus of agreement.

Amelia took a seat next to the bed and Brian stood behind her. "I'm Director Amelia Bones from the DMLE and this is Brian Cutter who is representing your interests as a solicitor. If you need to confer with him at any point, please request a stop and for the rest of us will leave."

Mary nodded slowly, casting a quick look at Brian.

The rest of the introductions were done swiftly and Amelia brought out the quill and parchment to automatically record Mary's testimony.

"Just begin at the beginning." Amelia encouraged.

Mary nodded uncertainly and looked at her brother who nodded.

"I was at the Market Place." Mary began. "It was…I had a craving for fresh apples; green ones. Colin…" another look to her brother, "he'd taken me in after my Dad threw me out. The baby…" she blushed furiously. "I'd…it was one night at a muggle club and there were drinks and…"

"We are not here to judge you." Amelia assured her.

"Well," Mary sighed, her colour receding, "they'd given us the leaflets in the clinic warning us to be on the look-out but I kind of thought they were just being paranoid. Colin had told me not to go out without him but…I really wanted the apples. I left Colin a note and headed out. There's a lovely fruit stall about half way in…"

"'Bountiful Bounty,'" Amelia nodded, "the stall owner recognised your picture. She said you were approached?"

"A small boy. He asked about the apples; said his Mum had sent him to get some since she was pregnant and tired." Mary shook her head. "He…dropped enough hints that made me worry that she was…I don't know ill or injured. I asked him to take me to her once he'd bought the apples." Her eyes dropped to the coverlet. "I followed him like a sheep."

"Where did he take you?" Amelia asked.

"A flat just off the Market Place but it was empty." Mary sighed and rubbed her nose. "I turned around to demand an explanation and…there was a red light."

"Stunning spell, most likely." Amelia supplied.

Mary nodded jerkily. "I woke up…" her voice broke.

Colin put an arm around her and Mary leaned into his comfort.

"I woke up chained up in the basement of a house." Mary managed to say before her eyes filled with tears. She swiped them away almost angrily and motioned Glenda away. "I'm fine."

Amelia glanced at the Healer and Remus could almost hear the internal debate of whether to continue or not. She turned back to Mary. "What happened in the house?"

"There were two of us chained up. Janice?" Mary turned hopefully to Amelia who shook her head. Her face filled with sadness. "Janice was…she was much braver than me. There was an unconscious man on the cot opposite. I didn't recognise him but Janice said he was Barty Crouch."

"It was." Amelia confirmed.

"Janice had been…they'd tortured her, killed her baby." Mary said bluntly in a rush. "I was so scared they'd do the same to me."

"Who is they, Ms Summers?" Amelia pressed her gently. "Can you tell us?"

Mary shifted awkwardly under the intense scrutiny as they waited for her to speak. "There were four of them. There was that dirty werewolf, Greyback. I recognised him from the wanted posters; a pudgy man they called Pettigrew; a younger man who…" she flushed lightly, "he was attractive, I mean, physically, but he was mad. He'd come down and just stare at the bloke on the cot."

"And the fourth?" prompted Amelia.

"It was…it was a baby." Mary shuddered. "But not. An abomination. Something possessing a child." She grimaced. "They bowed to him and called him Lord. I think they thought it was, well, You-Know-Who."

"We believe it is a wraith of Voldemort." Amelia said gently.

Remus watched as Mary gave a low moan and clutched at her brother. Colin tucked her into his side protectively.

"Did you hear anything that may give us an idea of their whereabouts or their plans?" Amelia said after a long pause.

"Any detail, child, no matter how much you think it irrelevant could be useful." Bertie interjected.

Mary looked at him for a long moment before she gave a nod. "You have to understand that they left us alone for the most part. We were given food once a day and there was water within reach. Otherwise…" she sighed, "it was dark and grim and awful but they left us alone."

"Except?" prompted Bertie, ignoring the glare from his sister-in-law.

"Except one night." Mary allowed reluctantly. Her free fingers plucked uneasily at her coverlet. "They left the door open and their voices drifted down."

They all waited; nobody wanted to rush her despite their need.

"The…the thing was talking about regaining a body. He mentioned Harry…Harry Potter. He said they were going to…going to kidnap him at the end of the Tournament." Mary shook her head and wet her lips.

Glenda reached over and handed her a glass of water.

Mary sipped gratefully for a long moment before she handed the water back and rearranged her covers a little self-consciously. "They said…they said they needed the blood of an enemy and the…*he* wouldn't accept anyone else."

Remus was a little disappointed. He could see why Voldemort hadn't wanted them to talk to the woman since they'd given away the ritual in what she'd overheard, but ultimately it wasn't anything they didn't already know.

"Thank you, Mary." Amelia said softly. "Now…"

Mary shook her head quickly. "That wasn't everything!" She said, leaning forward. "They were talking about *how* they were going to kidnap him. They said they'd be able to portkey him to the cemetery."

Remus perked up and so did Bertie.

"A cemetery?" Bertie asked before Remus could speak. "Did they say which cemetery?"

Mary shook her head. "Not…not exactly. They said something about the ritual having to be within a magical circle including where the bone of the father had been taken?" She sighed heavily. "I don't know more than that." She bit her lip and looked directly at Remus. "Please…tell Harry I'm sorry I couldn't be more help."

"You've been a wonderful help, and I know both Lord Black and Harry will be appreciative." Remus said truthfully. "You should rest and focus on the baby now."

Glenda stayed behind to do one last final check on her patient, and Brian demurred, wanting to discuss the options the brother and sister had now she was awake once more.

Amelia gave them a spare portkey and led the rest of them back into the garden. They portkeyed directly back to her office. She erected a privacy ward and turned to them with a triumphant smile.

"No wonder the bastard didn't want us talking to her." Amelia commented bluntly.

"Indeed," Bertie said, "but we should verify. Possibly the book Bill and Caro are examining will confirm it."

Remus nodded at his caution. "We'll verify," he said, "but if it holds true, Harry won't have to be alone." His eyes flashed amber. "He won't have to be alone because we'll know exactly where Voldemort is going to be do the ritual: in the cemetery at Little Hangleton."

And if they knew where the ritual was going to be, they could plan and take him down for good.
