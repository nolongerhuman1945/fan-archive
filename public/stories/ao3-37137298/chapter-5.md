“Alright, I’ll get work started on the silo first thing tomorrow, and the coop after that.”

The summer heat came in quickly to the valley, practically overnight. It was still somewhat jarring to the two farmers how quickly the seasons shifted, but they were quick to adjust. Izuku had the foresight to prepare for the coming summer, and with the help of Maru, installed an irrigation system to their farmland. The added sprinklers didn’t totally remove the need to water the crops, but it did help take a load off of the two, allowing for more effort to be focused elsewhere. Such as animal husbandry.

Kyoka was currently busy at Marnie’s Ranch, the woman offering to teach how to build all manner of items, from kegs to cheese presses. While the purple-haired girl was taught in the ways of the rancher, her boyfriend went to Robin’s to commission the buildings necessary for raising animals.

As well as a few… new additions to the house.

“I also have some furniture already made, so I can have the new double bed brought to your house by tonight.” The carpenter said with a knowing smirk.

Izuku quickly made himself scarce, not willing to be subjected to such teasing. He already got enough from his new friends, the last thing he needed was their *parents* getting in on it as well. *‘At least none of them are as bad as Ashido…’*

The thought of his classmate stopped the boy in his tracks. The time had flown by, but it had been over a month since the incident at the mall. As much as Izuku liked Pelican Town, he still had a home in Japan, another life and a mission waiting for him to return. What was Shigaraki doing during the Heroes’ absence, what plans were being created to see the downfall of society?

* * *

“God damn it! Twice, where did you put my fucking controllers!”

“I haven’t even touched them, ask Dabi. *I hope he melted them!*”

* * *

After taking a minute to shake the thought from his head, Izuku continued his walk to the Town library. Worrying about things out of his control wouldn’t do any good, and he had faith that even without himself and Kyoka, his friends were strong enough to handle whatever comes their way until they returned. And they would. He just had to keep thinking that.

As he entered the library, Izuku took a spare moment to look over the collection of gems and artifacts. Where once stood empty display cases as the previous collection had been entirely lost, but now the glass contained a small trove of precious stones, gems, geodes, and old artifacts. It was far from a complete restoration, but it was a solid start.

Penny entered the building while Izuku admired the growing showcase and began to organize and prepare for another day of tutoring. Pelican Town was without a proper school, and the nearest town was too far of a commute to be practical in the long term, even before the failure of the local bus. Penny decided to take it upon herself to provide an education to the two children of the village, Vincent and Jas. Laws concerning education seemed much more lax compared to Japan, as long as the children were able to pass examinations to show they understood the information, the Ferngill Republic did not bother with enforcing attendance to a licensed school.

“Hello there Izuku.”

“Oh, Hello. Sorry I didn’t notice you come in.” The green-haired boy responded.

“It’s alright. I was actually wondering, are you busy today?” A quick shake of his head confirmed he was not. “In that case, would you be willing to help tutor again? Vincent seemed to pickup the last math lesson quicker with your help.”

“Of course, I don’t mind, how long until they get here? I can go home and grab some supplies.” Penny was quick to stop him, “That’s alright, I brought more than enough. We’ll start with math today, I know you offered to help, but I won’t keep you long.”

It wasn’t long before Jas, Marnie’s niece, entered. She was initially shy of the two new residents, but after mustering the courage to ask Kyoka about her ‘cool ear dangles’ the two hit it off. Some time with Izuku during her tutoring helped warm her up to the young farmer as well. Vincent arrived a few minutes after Jas, and his solemn face lit up at seeing Izuku would be helping again today.

The lesson went by quickly, even if the history was entirely new and the reading unfamiliar, math would always be math, and Izuku considered it to be among best subjects. Right below Hero Law. As Izuku made to leave, Penny stopped him before the door, “Are you going to be busy tomorrow?”

“Not beyond the usual, but I thought you didn’t tutor tomorrow?” He asked with a hint of confusion.

“I’m not, but I planned a small educational fieldtrip to the forest tomorrow. It’s really just going to be a picnic while I quiz them on natural science, and I wanted to know if you or Kyoka would like to join us.”

“Well, I don’t know about Kyoka, but I’d love too!” Izuku said with a large grin on his face. As Penny told him the planned time and left to get back to her lesson, Izuku let his mind wander to tomorrow. A nice relaxing lunch with friends sounded like a perfect break for the two farmers.

“Hey there Kyoka, Izuku!” Gus’ friendly greeting was loud enough to cut through the commotion of the small crowd in the saloon. While she preferred to cook her own meals, today Kyoka and Izuku decided to have their dinner at the Stardrop Saloon, both from not wanting to put forth the effort of preparing their own food, but also a desire to interact with the community. The last few days were dominated by a rainstorm, and while it mean the two farmers did not have to spend the effort of watering their fields, with most of the town not wanting to brave the weather, Izuku and Kyoka had little interaction with people beyond each other. With the rain finally letting up, the two decided it would be a good idea to spend some time at the small Saloon.

A very popular sentiment it seemed, as what felt like half the town had the same idea. After battling their way to the counter, the two placed an order, a large salad with a side of grilled salmon each. Fish was actually a large part of most people’s diets in the valley, as most farms in the area only raised animals for products such as wool and milk, not for slaughter. That wasn’t to say the entire area was pescatarian, but with the local farm practices meaning meat products had to be imported in, most people only had meat for special occasions and town events. Luckily the famers had little trouble adjusting, but Izuku would admit it was hard going without his favorite meal of katsudon on a regular basis.

The only seats not taken were two bar seats near the register Gus used to do business, and with some reluctance, the famers sat down. There wasn’t anything wrong with the spots themselves, no localized drafts, annoying glares, or wobbly stools. The problem was with how close they were to Gus. The owner of the Saloon was all in all a great guy, generous to his neighbors and always ready to offer a hand to those in need, but well…

“Are you two excited for the luau? Out of all the festivals it’s one of my favorites and not just for the communal soup pot. While everyone pitches in to the potluck and the soup, every year I make this special glazed ham that’s a hit with the town. I’ll have to make sure to save some for you two, my treat. I get the meat from a friend in Zuzu city who runs a butcher shop, even with a discount the ham cost a pretty penny, but I can assure you, it’s worth it. As for the glaze, I use spices from Ginger Island…”

He was passionate about his craft. A little *too* passionate. Izuku didn’t mind so much, as he knew the feeling of being so absorbed in a passion that you can’t help but talk on and on for hours, but by the second sentence Kyoka had tuned out. As she pretended to pay full attention, a skill the girl had picked up in middle school and mastered at U.A., Kyoka let her mind wander.

She knew her boyfriend was worried about returning to Japan, or more accurately, the possibility of not returning at all. To be honest, the idea of just ‘waiting for the effect to wear off’ had always seemed a bit flimsy to her, and if whatever Quirk that warped the two worked like that, then surely it would have worn off by now. The only reason Kyoka allowed herself to believe that someday soon the two would be returned to Japan was because, well… she was scared. Scared about never seeing her friends again. Scared of the thought of her parents mourning for her without even a body to bury. Scared that the League of Villains would make another move to hurt the people close to her, and she wouldn’t even know.

But as the days passed, it started to solidify the idea that there was no return. Izuku did a good job of hiding it, but Kyoka had been around him long enough to see past the thin façade he put up. He had started throwing himself into working the farm and training, barley giving himself a moment to rest and dwell on the bigger picture. But with the last few days of rain, there wasn’t enough for Izuku to do to totally occupy his mind, and it showed. Kyoka didn’t know how to approach the topic, as she didn’t even want to admit the possibility of never returning to herself, much less out loud. So she didn’t.

After that depressing train of thought, Kyoka finished her meal shortly after Izuku did, and mingled a bit to take her mind off of things. Even if she was stuck here, at least she wasn’t alone. She had new friends, a stable source of income, and a boyfriend that had the personality of a cinnamon roll and the strength to shatter glaciers with a flick of a finger. All things considered she could be worse off.

The farmers paid for their meals and said goodbye to their friends before making their way back home. Spending some time curled up together on the sofa while watching whatever was on TV would do them both some good, help put the thoughts of not coming back on hold, even if only for a night. It had become something of a ritual to end the day by simply enjoying each other’s presence, with a movie or radio to provide background noise. A daily tradition Kyoka wasn’t keen on changing.

If Izuku had a single g for every time his right arm was engulfed in sheer agony after being brought to Pelican Town, he’d have 2g. Which was surprisingly little considering his track record of breaking limbs in the past.

But unlike the shattered limbs of the past or even the Wizards potion, where he at least knew what had caused such pain, right now he had no clue what was happening. The day had started out like any other, wake up, eat breakfast, tend the farm, until the two farmers decided to go spelunking in the mines. A couple days ago they had reached a new section of the caverns, with the frigid cold and ice giving way to an uncomfortable heat.

The two tried to be carful with this new area, while the monsters still posted little threat, they were getting noticeably tougher, and going in overconfident could be disastrous. Izuku was occupied by what looked like a vaguely humanoid mass of shadow wearing a wooden tribal mask when he heard Kyoka cry out. He turned to see his girlfriend knocked to the floor by a larger shadow person that had snuck up on her, and quickly moved to her side. In reality Kyoka wasn’t severely injured and would only suffer a large bruise where the creature struck, but in the rush of the situation all Izuku could see was the woman he loved suffering. Until his vision went red, and a wave of anger overtook him.

Izuku had been angry before, but this was different from the anger he felt from being mocked most of his life for being Quirkless or learning the abuse Overhaul put Eri through, which helped fuel his drive to change things for the better. This anger was all consuming, flooding every part of his body until it felt like it would burst. And then, it did.

From his right hand, shadowy tendrils erupted and started writhing, thrashing, and destroying. The two shadow creatures barely had time to realize what was happening before being bisected and dissipating. Even with the threat gone, Izuku couldn’t control whatever was happening to him, much less stop it. The only thought that cut through the pain was the fact that he was still near Kyoka, and put everything he had into making the black, shadowy mass avoid her.

Kyoka, who hadn’t had time to pick herself off the ground before… whatever the hell this was, was left in shock. The black tendrils seemed to be avoiding her, but the same could not be said of the surrounding stone. As chucks of wall and ceiling were torn away with surprising ease, Izuku’s waring about triggering a cave in seemed prophetic in hindsight. If Kyoka didn’t do something soon, they would both be buried alive under a mountain of stone, but what could she do? Even if the black mass hadn’t hit her yet, the way they cleaved through stone made approaching a very risky prospect.

It was shameful to admit, but the situation had Kyoka frozen in her spot, unable to bring herself closer to help, and unwilling to leave Izuku. Until she saw his face. In her mind, Izuku’s face was always a bright smile that lit up the room, or a look of absolute confidence, but now his face was twisted in a horrifying mix of pain and fear. And Kyoka’s legs moved on their own.

Either by exceptional skill or dumb luck, Kyoka closed the distance and wrapped her arms around the boy. “Izuku. It’s alright, I’m here. I’m fine.” The sudden contact and her words seemed to help ground Izuku somewhat, as the thrashing became a little less intense. “I know you’re probably scared and hurting a lot, but we’re going to be fine, just focus on my voice and what I’m saying.” It was a bluff. For all she knew the cave ceiling could come down at any moment, but if the choices were to save herself and abandon Izuku or stay and risk her life with every second, then there really wasn’t a choice.

By some miracle, the worst never came to pass. Despite the large amounts of damage, the cavern held strong as Kyoka tried everything she could think of to break Izuku out of whatever had taken hold of him. After a few minutes of calm assurances, breathing patterns, and grounding techniques, the odd shadowy mass no longer risked collapsing the cavern. It took half an hour before the tendrils had totally receded into the boy’s arm. The moment they did, almost all the tension in the verdanettes body left, and with the panic and adrenaline no longer flowing through his body, Izuku passed out.

When Izuku awoke he wasn’t in the mines, or even anywhere in town, but an empty expanse. In front of him was a bald man who seemed vaguely familiar.

“Hey there Nine. Hell of a way to get a new quirk huh?” New quirk? Izuku’s mind was racing trying to figure out who this man was and what he meant when he realized he couldn’t speak. “Yeah, it’s probably going to be like that for a while, but don’t worry about it.”

*‘Wait, can he read my thoughts?’*

“Yeah, not hard to do when I’m in your head after all. Name’s Banjo Daigoro, the fifth user of One for All.”

* * *

 Kyoka left the small entrance to the mines straining to carry Izuku over her shoulder, while trying to gather her thoughts. While she may not have even completed her first year of Hero schooling, the repeated villain attacks on class 1-A meant that Kyoka had become accustomed to life-or-death situations. After overcoming the initial shock that had her rooted to the ground, it was easy to push back her worries to the back of her mind for later.

But it was later, and right now it felt like no amount of experience would help her get used to what came after a crisis like this. After the boy in her arms had passed out, she initially feared the worst, but a quick check of his pulse proved he was still alive. After slowly dragging her surprisingly heavy boyfriend to the elevator, then and only then did she allow herself the time to panic.

She felt worse than she did after the USJ attack. While Shigaraki may have brought a Nomu, a bioengineered weapon designed to kill All Might, she never actually saw the fight between the monstrosity and her classmates. Kyoka knew some of her friends nearly died but being told about an event and being there to see the people close to you almost die was quite a difference. And being there, in person, watching the person closest to her in terrible pain and practically begging for help, Kyoka had hesitated.

 *‘I’m such a failure. None of the class would hesitate to help him. Izuku wouldn’t hesitate to help anyone. I’m trying to be a Hero, but I couldn’t even move to help!’* The self-deprecating thoughts were cut off as Kyoka heard Izuku stir and begin to wake. She quickly moved to sit him up against a tree by the large mountain top lake.

Izuku woke slowly at first, trying to adjust his eyes to the light and work the stiffness from his muscles, before the memories of what happened before he had passed out caused him to snap wide awake while calling out, “Kyoka! A-are you…”

His girlfriend grabbed him by the hand, putting a halt to his panic while trying her best to stay positive and confident. “I’m not hurt, b-but you did scare me there for a minute mop top.” While Kyoka hoped being casual about the encounter would help alleviate any remaining tension, all her comment did was make Izuku even more concerned. “K-Kyoka… I’m so sorry, I almost hurt you and I couldn’t stop it from…”

“Hey, calm down. You don’t have to apologize to me.” Kyoka knew that trying to stop Izuku from apologizing for something was like trying to hold back the concept of gravity, but she still tried every time. Izuku’s eyes moved to look at the ground and his voice fell, “B-but I could have hurt you… o-or worse…”

“But you didn’t, and I know you Izuku. You wouldn’t hurt a fly unless it was robbing a bank, and I know for sure you wouldn’t hurt me. Besides, I’m the one that should be apologizing.” Izuku was confused by her statement. He almost killed them both via a Quirk accident and she was the one saying sorry? “I-I don’t understand, why are you apologizing? I almost…”

“But it wasn’t your fault, I know you tried your best to stop whatever the hell that was!” The Earphone Jack user shouted out, “And I couldn’t move! I saw how much you were hurting, and I hesitated! You throw yourself into anything to save people you don’t even know and I just… couldn’t.”

“But you did.” Izuku moved closer to his distressed girlfriend. “I… I was so scared, and I didn’t even have an idea of what was happening or how to stop it. And then you ran in to help me. When you were there, I just felt like everything was going to be all right. You where a real Hero. My Hero.”

While his speech made Kyoka feel a little better about the situation, Izuku could tell she was still beating herself up for panicking. The two sat in silence for a moment, while he considered his next words, before the boy decided to speak up again. “You know, I’m always scared when doing hero work.”

“W-what?” Kyoka wiped away tears that were forming to look back towards Izuku. “Pretty much every time I have to fight someone, I always think of the worst possible outcomes, and it terrifies me.” A large grin spread over the boy’s face as he continued his pep talk. “But then I think about how I can help stop that from happening… well technically that’s not true. Before I even know if I can help, the idea of helping just… pops through my head and before I know it, I’m already moving to help. But before that moment… I’m hesitating, thinking ‘what’s going to go wrong.’”

As his words sank in, Kyoka moved to sit next to her boyfriend and take a moment to process. After a small, comfortable silence, she spoke up. “Hey, Izuku?”

As he turned his head to look at her, Kyoka gave the boy a small kiss “Thank you.”

Not one to be outdone or waste a romantic moment, Izuku startled Kyoka by pulling her onto his lap before hugging her from behind. “Anytime.”

The couple shared the evening resting under the tree, while watching the setting sun’s light cascade across the surface of the lake, casting the world in a comfortable warm hue. By the time Izuku felt it was time to leave, a couple of hours had passed and the two had barley moved. He was about to suggest returning to the house when a realization hit the young farmer. She had never actually asked him about what had happened.

“Hey Kyo?” He said before receiving a small hum of acknowledgement. “Aren’t you going to ask about what that whole thing was?”

“Well, I am curious, and mostly I just want to know how to stop something like this from happening again. But I felt like if you were comfortable with talking about it, you would bring it up. So… are you?” The purple-haired girl responded while trying to crane her head to look at Izuku’s face. Before giving up and returning to the comfortable position she was in.

“Well, I am, but it kind of involves brining up some secrets, and before you say anything, know I don’t have to tell you and I *do* want to tell you. It’s just… a really long and weird story.” Kyoka let out a low chuckle. “Well, we have time and I’m currently cuddling with my boyfriend I started dating after we were both warped across dimensions. So, talk away.”

Izuku started at the beginning, not from the day he was diagnosed Quirkless, but with the dawn of Quirks themselves. Two brothers, One born with a Quirk above all others, the ability to steal Quirks, and the other sickly and powerless. How out of love, pity, a desire for control, or any other unfathomable reason the elder brother gave a Quirk to the younger, a simple Quirk that stockpiles power. But his brother wasn’t Quirkless. Unlike the elder, he couldn’t take Quirks, but he could still give his own away. Seemingly useless, but with the addition of another Quirk, the two fused into something greater. A Quirk that could store energy and pass it one to another, to carry the torch and build it brighter and brighter. The dual-Quirk was named One for All, the antithesis of the it’s creator Quirk, All for One.

Eventually the younger brother opposed cruel actions of the elder and fought against him and his criminal empire. He was killed for his efforts. But not before passing One for All on. His successor fought the elder brother and met a similar fate. It wasn’t until the 8th holder, the Symbol of Peace, All Might fought and won, but not without great cost.

“The older brother is only known by the name of his Quirk, All for One. He was the villain that All Might fought at Kamino.” Kyoka let that information sink in for a moment. “So, I’m guessing since you know this whole secret story… you weren’t really a late bloomer?” A soft “No” left Izuku’s lips. Kyoka responded after a short moment. “Thank you for trusting me with this. For what my opinions worth, I think All Might made the best choice of his life when he chose you.”

The words were worth a lot to Izuku, as he held her opinion in high regard. While he never thought Kyoka would look down on him for being Quirkless, hearing her words out loud made his heart feel lighter.

“What happened back in the mine’s though, well…” Even though Izuku had just been told his next words were true, even he had a hard time believing the situation would get stranger. “As it turns out, One for All was still ‘growing’ in a way. It’s hit some sort of critical mass recently. The Quirk doesn’t just store and pass on power, but a lot of the previous holders. Their strength, their memories, and even their Quirks.”

This stunned Kyoka silent for a second. “So that whole inky-black-shadow-tendrils thing was…”

“One of the previous holder’s Quirks. The fifth one to be specific, Black Whip. I only met Banjo Daigoro, bit he says soon I’ll meet all of the other holders and get their Quirks.” Kyoka felt it was a bit ironic, the Quirkless boy now in possession of multiple Quirk, but she didn’t point it out, instead opting to question further. “So, how many will you get? And do you know what they will be?”

“Well, Including the super strength, I’ll have seven. All Might told me his mentor had a floating Quirk powered up to allow full flight, but as for the rest, no idea. Daigoro only said that I’ll ‘be seeing Nana soon’”

Kyoka wanted to find out more, and ask more and more, to the point she began to think Izuku was rubbing off on her. She pushed those questions to the side, however. Both farmers were feeling worn out and emotionally exhausted after such a day. “I’ve got nearly a hundred different things to ask you right now, but I think I’ll save it for latter. I just want to enjoy the rest of the evening.”

“Do you want to head back to the house now?”

“Nah,” Kyoka felt too comfortable in her current position to try and leave it. “Not right now.”
