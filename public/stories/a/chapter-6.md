# Chapter 6

The light from the single bulb cast harsh shadows across Dr. Marcus Webb's face, turning wrinkles into canyons. He looked tired—the bone-deep exhaustion of someone who'd carried guilt for seven decades and was finally setting the burden down.

Aris didn't move from his position near the support beam. "Seven more. Where are they?"

"Scattered. Hiding, mostly. Some don't even know what they are." Webb pulled a flask from his jacket and took a drink. Whiskey, based on the smell. "We created twelve subjects total across six facilities between 1949 and 1953. Project Genesis was supposed to be humanity's leap forward—stable quantum beings who could manipulate fundamental forces. Super soldiers without the serum, powers without the mutations."

"How many survived the process?"

"Nine. You, Sarah Chen, and seven others." Webb's hand trembled slightly as he recapped the flask. "Three died during the initial treatments. Their bodies rejected the quantum restructuring. Tore themselves apart at the molecular level."

Aris felt sick. "Children. You experimented on children."

"Orphans. Runaways. Kids nobody would miss." Webb met his gaze without flinching. "I can't claim ignorance or noble intentions. We knew what we were doing. Justified it as necessary for national security, for human advancement. All the usual lies people tell themselves when they're doing monstrous things."

"Why tell me this now?"

"Because someone's killing the Subjects. Started six months ago—Subject Zero-Five found dead in Prague, drained of all bioelectric energy. Then Zero-Eight in Singapore, same method. Now they're accelerating. The attacks on SHIELD facilities, Sarah's breakdown—it's all connected to whoever's hunting you."

The warehouse felt colder suddenly. Aris pushed away from the beam, moving into the light. "What do they want?"

"Your power. Your stability." Webb stood, joints creaking. "See, Project Genesis had a flaw. The quantum restructuring worked, but it was unstable in most subjects. They developed the hunger—that need to absorb more and more energy to maintain coherence. Sarah's a perfect example. But you..." He gestured at Aris. "You're different. You achieved stability naturally. Whatever mutation or quirk in your baseline genetics, you became what we'd hoped all the Subjects would be."

"And someone wants to know why."

"Someone wants to harvest it. Extract whatever makes you stable and use it to fix the others. Or create more like you." Webb pulled a worn folder from inside his jacket and held it out. "These are the remaining seven. Names, last known locations, photographs. Some are old—I lost track of most of them after the facilities closed."

Aris took the folder but didn't open it yet. "Who's hunting them?"

"I don't know. Could be remnants of the original Genesis team trying to finish the project. Could be HYDRA, SHIELD, AIM—any organization that's heard rumors about quantum manipulation and wants it for themselves." Webb's voice dropped. "Or it could be one of the Subjects themselves. Someone who's found a way to stabilize by consuming the others."

That possibility made Aris's blood run cold. The idea of another Subject Zero hunting their siblings for power—it fit. Fit too well.

"Why come to me?" he asked. "Why not go to SHIELD with this information?"

"Because SHIELD will try to round up all the Subjects, lock them away for study. They'll call it protective custody but it'll be a cage." Webb's expression hardened. "I made you what you are. That's my sin to carry. But I'll be damned if I let anyone else turn you into weapons."

Aris opened the folder. Seven faces stared up at him from old photographs, most in black and white. Children frozen in time, eyes too old for their faces.

Subject Zero-Two: Michael Torres. Hispanic boy, maybe twelve in the photo. Last known location: Mexico City, 1987.

Subject Zero-Four: Elena Volkov. The name made Aris pause. "Volkov? Related to—"

"Yuri Volkov's grandmother. The Red Room got interested in Genesis research through family connections." Webb's jaw tightened. "Elena disappeared in 1956. Probably taken by the Soviets for their own programs."

Subject Zero-Six: James Park. Korean-American, ten years old in the photo. Last seen: San Francisco, 2001.

Subject Zero-Seven: Alexei Kozlov. Aris already knew that story—Subject Seven was back to being human, recovering in SHIELD custody.

Subject Zero-Nine: Maria Santos. Dark-skinned girl with defiant eyes. Last known: São Paulo, 1979.

Subject Zero-Ten: David Kim. Another Korean name. Twin to Zero-Six, maybe? Last seen: Tokyo, 2008.

Subject Zero-Eleven: Rachel Goldman. Blonde hair, blue eyes, maybe eight years old. Last known: Berlin, 1973.

Aris stopped breathing.

Berlin, 1973. The blackout he'd caused. The hospital with four dead.

"Rachel was there," he said quietly. "When I lost control."

Webb nodded. "I know. I tracked the incident. She survived, went deeper underground after that. She'd been living as a street kid, using her abilities to survive. Your power surge knocked her unconscious—probably saved her life, actually. The police would've found her otherwise."

"Where is she now?"

"No idea. That was the last confirmed sighting." Webb pulled out a second folder, thinner. "But I have this. Intercepted communications suggesting someone made contact with her in 2010. Tried to recruit her for something. She refused, disappeared again."

Aris took the second folder and skimmed the contents. Fragments of emails, partial phone transcripts, surveillance photos too blurry to be useful. But one phrase appeared repeatedly: *resonance cascade*.

"What's resonance cascade?" he asked.

"Theoretical instability in quantum-restructured beings. If two or more Subjects use their powers in close proximity, their energy frequencies can synchronize. Amplify each other." Webb's voice took on the clinical detachment of a scientist discussing data. "In small doses, it might enhance abilities. But at scale? It could tear apart local spacetime. Make what Sarah Chen did in Manhattan look like a candle next to a forest fire."

"You're saying if we get too many Subjects together, we could accidentally destroy reality."

"Not accidentally. It would require deliberate synchronization, specific frequency matching. But yes, theoretically possible."

Wonderful. As if being hunted wasn't bad enough.

Aris closed both folders and met Webb's gaze. "Why should I trust you? You created this nightmare. For all I know, you're the one hunting the Subjects."

"You shouldn't trust me. I don't deserve it." Webb pulled up his sleeve, revealing a medical bracelet. "Stage four cancer. Pancreatic. I've got maybe six months left, probably less. I'm not hunting anyone—I'm trying to make peace with what I did before I die."

The bioelectric signature Webb radiated confirmed it. Aris could sense the cellular degradation, the way cancer spread through the old man's body like wildfire. Dying, definitely. No threat.

"What do you want from me?" Aris asked.

"Find the others before whoever's hunting them does. Warn them. Help them if you can." Webb handed over a phone—old flip model, practically antique. "This has my number. If you need information, resources, anything I can provide, call. I owe you that much."

Aris pocketed the phone and folders. "SHIELD's going to want to know about this conversation."

"Then tell them. But give yourself a head start first." Webb turned toward the warehouse's rear exit. "One more thing—Subject Zero-Two, Michael Torres. He's in New York. Brooklyn, specifically. I tracked him six months ago but lost him in the Red Hook area. He's worth finding first."

"Why?"

"Because he's been stable as long as you have. If there's a pattern to who achieves control and who doesn't, it starts with the two of you."

Webb disappeared into the darkness, footsteps fading. Aris stood alone under the single bulb, holding folders full of ghosts and the growing certainty that his life was about to get significantly more complicated.

His phone—his real phone—buzzed. Text from Natasha: *Where are you?*

Aris looked at the message, at the folders in his hand, at the exit where Webb had vanished. Every instinct said run. Disappear back into the grey market, let SHIELD handle the Subject Zero situation. It wasn't his responsibility.

Except it absolutely was.

He typed back: *Queens. Warehouse district. Need pickup and a conversation with Fury. Found something important.*

*On my way. Don't move.*

Seventeen minutes later, Natasha arrived in a black SUV with two additional agents. She approached Aris with the controlled wariness of someone who'd read his medical chart and knew he'd left against doctor's orders.

"You look terrible," she said.

"Becoming a theme." He handed her the folders. "Read these in the car. We have a problem."

She opened the first folder, expression neutral as she scanned the contents. But Aris saw her pupils dilate slightly, heartbeat accelerate. "Where did you get this?"

"Dr. Marcus Webb. Lead researcher on Project Genesis. He contacted me, said someone's hunting the remaining Subjects."

"Webb's dead. SHIELD closed his file in 1987 after confirmed termination."

"Then he got better." Aris climbed into the SUV's back seat. "Or SHIELD's records are wrong. Either way, he's dying for real this time. Cancer. Looked pretty far gone."

Natasha slid in beside him, already pulling out her tablet and cross-referencing the folder's contents with SHIELD databases. "Seven more enhanced individuals with abilities like yours and Sarah Chen's. Jesus. Fury's going to have an aneurysm."

"He'll have to get in line. I already called dibs."

The drive back to the Triskelion passed in relative silence, Natasha absorbed in research while Aris stared out the window at pre-dawn Manhattan. The city looked peaceful from here—no alien invasions, no quantum anomalies, just millions of people sleeping before another day.

How many of them knew the world teetered constantly on the edge of catastrophe? That there were people walking around with abilities that could accidentally tear holes in reality?

Not enough. Probably better that way.

Fury was waiting when they arrived, standing in his office with arms crossed and the particular expression that meant someone was about to get yelled at. Based on the way his gaze fixed on Aris, the target was obvious.

"You left a medical facility without being cleared," Fury said. No preamble, just straight to business. "Against doctor's orders, without notifying anyone, to meet with a contact who's supposedly been dead for twenty-five years."

"In my defense, he seemed pretty alive when we talked."

"That's not funny."

"Wasn't trying to be." Aris handed over the folders. "Dr. Marcus Webb. He created Project Genesis and the twelve Subject Zeros. Says someone's hunting the remaining seven and we need to find them first."

Fury opened the folders, single eye scanning the contents with practiced speed. His expression didn't change but Aris felt the tension ratchet up several notches.

"These photographs," Fury said carefully. "Some of them are classified above your clearance level. Documents that should only exist in one extremely secure location."

"Webb was lead researcher. He'd have access."

"Not anymore. Not for decades." Fury set the folders on his desk with deliberate precision. "Which means either he broke into one of our most secure archives, or someone inside SHIELD gave him this information."

The implications hung heavy. A mole. Someone feeding intelligence to Webb, or using Webb as a cutout to deliver information.

"Could be HYDRA," Natasha suggested. "After the Chitauri invasion, we know they've been more active. Infiltration, resource acquisition, enhanced individual recruitment."

"Could be," Fury agreed. "Or it could be someone in our own organization who thinks Project Genesis research is too important to leave buried." He turned to Aris. "You believe Webb's story? That he's dying and trying to make amends?"

Aris thought about the old man's bioelectric signature, the cellular degradation, the weight of guilt carried in every word. "I believe he's dying. Whether he's trying to make amends or manipulate me toward some other goal? Harder to say."

"Honest answer." Fury tapped the folder labeled Subject Zero-Two. "He said Michael Torres is in Brooklyn?"

"Red Hook area. Lost track six months ago but thinks he's still there."

"Then that's where you're going. With backup this time." Fury's tone suggested this wasn't negotiable. "Romanoff will coordinate. You find Torres, assess whether he's stable or a threat, and bring him in for protection if he's willing."

"And if he's not willing?"

"Then you convince him. Because if Webb's right about someone hunting the Subjects, Torres is already a target."

Red Hook at noon looked like urban decay pretending to be artistic. Converted warehouses advertised loft spaces for artists who'd been priced out of Manhattan. Small businesses clung to existence between empty storefronts. The waterfront stretched gray and industrial, cargo ships visible in the distance.

Aris and Natasha moved through the neighborhood separately, communicating via encrypted earbuds, trying not to look like federal agents hunting for enhanced individuals. They'd changed into civilian clothes—Aris in worn jeans and a jacket that hid his tactical vest, Natasha in dark pants and a leather jacket that somehow looked both casual and ready for combat.

"Anything?" Natasha's voice crackled in his ear.

"No quantum signatures." Aris reached out with his abilities, scanning for the distinctive energy pattern another Subject Zero would radiate. Normal bioelectric fields everywhere—people going about their lives, completely unaware they were being surveilled. "Either Torres isn't here or he's learned to suppress his signature."

"Could he do that?"

"I can. With concentration. Makes me harder to detect but also limits my abilities." Aris turned down a side street, following an instinct more than any concrete lead. "If Torres has been hiding for decades, he'd develop similar techniques."

"We should split up. Cover more ground."

"Bad idea if someone's actually hunting him. They could be watching for people searching."

"Then we're already compromised."

Fair point. Aris adjusted his trajectory toward the waterfront, where older buildings clustered near abandoned piers. Good place to hide—not enough foot traffic to draw attention, enough exits to run if necessary.

His electromagnetic sense tickled. Something off about one of the warehouses ahead. Not a human signature—too diffuse, too controlled. Like someone was deliberately masking their presence.

"Natasha. Warehouse at the end of Van Brunt Street. Something's there."

"On my way. Don't engage without backup."

But Aris was already moving closer, curiosity overriding caution. The warehouse's windows were boarded over, door marked with a condemned notice that looked official but felt wrong. He touched the lock and felt the electromagnetic signature of a security system—recent installation, sophisticated.

Someone was living here. Someone who didn't want visitors.

He picked the lock through simple electromagnetic manipulation, feeling tumblers shift into position. The door swung open silently.

Inside, darkness. Aris let his eyes adjust, using thermal imaging to map the space. Empty crates, tarps covering equipment, and in the far corner—

A figure stood up from behind a makeshift desk, hands raised, not aggressive but clearly ready to defend.

"You're SHIELD," the man said. Hispanic accent, probably Mexican based on the regional inflections. "I can smell it on you."

"Not SHIELD. Freelance." Aris kept his hands visible. "Are you Michael Torres?"

"Depends who's asking."

"Someone who shares your particular problem." Aris let a flicker of energy dance across his knuckles—blue-white light that illuminated both their faces. "Subject Zero. Like you."

Torres's expression shifted from wariness to shock. "No. You're—that's not possible. We're all supposed to be dead or captured."

"Seven of us aren't. And someone's hunting the survivors." Aris extinguished the light. "Dr. Webb sent me. Said you were stable, worth finding first."

"Webb." The name came out bitter. "That bastard's still alive?"

"Dying of cancer. Has maybe six months. Apparently feeling guilty enough to warn the people he experimented on."

Torres laughed, sharp and humorless. "Too little, too late. You know what my childhood was like? Being torn apart and put back together at the quantum level while scientists took notes? Watching other kids die screaming because their bodies rejected the process?"

"Yeah." Aris took a careful step closer. "Subject Zero. Manhattan facility, 1949. I remember."

"Bullshit. Zero was—" Torres stopped, really looking at Aris for the first time. "Oh my God. You don't age either."

"Slowly. Very slowly." Aris pulled out the folder Webb had given him and tossed it to Torres. "Seven others are still out there. Someone's killing them, draining their energy. Sarah Chen—Subject Three—almost destroyed Manhattan trying to fight back. We need to find the others before the hunter does."

Torres caught the folder but didn't open it. "Why should I care? I've spent sixty years hiding from everyone who wants to use me as a weapon. Government agencies, terrorist organizations, you name it. Why would I expose myself now?"

"Because the alternative is dying alone when someone finds you." Natasha's voice came from the doorway, weapon drawn but pointed down. She'd entered silently, moved into position while Torres was focused on Aris. Professional. "Or watching other people like you get killed because you refused to help."

Torres looked between them, calculating odds. Aris felt his energy signature spike—preparing to fight or flee.

"Easy," Aris said. "We're not here to capture you. Just offering protection and information. You can walk away right now if you want."

"And you'll just let me go?"

"I'll recommend SHIELD keeps tabs on you for everyone's safety. But yeah, we're not going to drag you in chains." Aris met his gaze. "We're not like the Genesis researchers. Choice matters."

Long pause. Torres's energy signature stabilized, fight-or-flight response ebbing.

"Fine," he said finally. "I'll listen. But I'm not making any promises."

They talked for two hours in that warehouse, Natasha sitting on a crate taking notes while Aris and Torres compared experiences. Turned out Torres had achieved stability through meditation and strict control—he'd trained with Tibetan monks for fifteen years, learned to quiet the hunger through mental discipline.

"The power wants to grow," Torres explained. "Wants to consume more and more energy until you're basically a walking black hole. But it's not separate from us—it's part of our consciousness. You can negotiate with it, establish boundaries."

"That what you did?"

"More or less. Took decades to get it right." Torres pulled out a worn journal, pages filled with handwritten notes. "I've been documenting everything. Triggers that cause loss of control, techniques for suppression, theories about why some Subjects stabilize while others don't."

Natasha leaned forward. "Would you be willing to share that research? It could help Sarah Chen. Maybe save her life."

Torres considered. "On one condition—I stay anonymous. No official records, no SHIELD database entries, nothing that makes me a target."

"Deal," Natasha said immediately, probably overstepping her authority but knowing Fury would approve anyway. "We'll set you up with a secure channel to Dr. Cross—she's treating Sarah. You can consult remotely."

"Who's Dr. Cross?"

"SHIELD psychologist specializing in enhanced individuals. She's good—actually gives a damn about patients instead of just studying them."

That seemed to satisfy Torres. He handed over the journal and a USB drive. "Everything I've learned. Use it well."

They left the warehouse as afternoon faded toward evening, Aris and Natasha walking back toward the extraction point while Torres packed up to relocate—standard protocol after contact with SHIELD agents, just in case anyone had been watching.

"One down," Natasha said. "Six to go."

"Assuming they're all still alive."

"Optimism. I like it."

Aris smiled despite the weight of what they'd learned. "Torres was good at hiding. If he can do it, maybe the others can too."

"Maybe. But Sarah Chen was good at hiding for sixty years and she still broke." Natasha's expression turned serious. "We need to move fast. Find the others before whoever's hunting them gets there first."

"Agreed. Webb said Subject Six and Ten might be twins—both Korean, last seen in San Francisco and Tokyo. That's where SHIELD hasn't been hit yet."

"Tokyo facility. Fury was already planning to send you there." She pulled out her phone, checking messages. "Looks like the op got moved up. You leave tomorrow morning."

"Romantic getaway?"

"Business trip. With guns." But she was smiling slightly. "Try not to almost die this time. Gets repetitive."

"I'll do my best."

They reached the SUV where two agents waited, engines running. Aris climbed in, exhausted and wired simultaneously. His phone buzzed—the one Webb had given him.

Text from unknown number: *Good work finding Torres. But you're too slow. The hunter's already in Tokyo. You have 48 hours before Subject Ten dies.*

Aris showed the message to Natasha. Her jaw tightened.

"Son of a bitch. Webb's monitoring us."

"Or someone else is." Aris deleted the message but knew it wouldn't matter. Whoever sent it had resources, had information, had been watching their every move.

The hunter wasn't some distant threat. They were already three steps ahead.

And in Tokyo, David Kim—Subject Zero-Ten—was running out of time.
