***...~AIV~...***

"Bye, Mom!" Izuku opened the door to start his second official day of UA. The first day had been...strange.

Not bad. Just strange.

He had actually made friends. Granted, it was only two people, but that was a major improvement by his standards. He was just glad they liked Kyouka. If either Uraraka or Iida took some sort of dislike to her, then Izuku wouldn't have been particularly interested in their friendship. He would've done his best to make sure everyone got along, but if it somehow came down to the group splitting, it was obvious which direction Izuku would've gone.

It was actually a little odd, because Izuku almost felt it was Kyouka who didn't like the other two. Well, more like the other one. It wasn't Iida that he noticed she acted a little differently around. It was Uraraka. Whenever the brunette came around, which admittedly was very little since they had only known her for a single day, Kyouka seemed to get just the slightest bit tenser. It was really noticeable on the group's walk to the train station after school. Instead of hanging limply on her shoulders, her jacks were always moving around. Izuku had no real evidence to support him. He was just going to have to ask Kyouka about it himself. 

If Uraraka had said something, then Izuku wanted to know what it was and why it made Kyouka so on edge. If it was actually a problem, Izuku would do everything in his power to make peace.

How hard could it be to fix the relationship of two people who barely know one another?

"Oh, Izuku!" Inko called from the living room. "Before you go, a letter from your father came in the mail!"

...Oh yeah, pretty damn hard.

Izuku sighed and rolled his shoulders back, "I'll read it when I get back." 

From her seat on the couch, Inko didn't need to see her son to know he had a disinterested expression. Her heart hurt at the thought of it, but she knew she wouldn't be able to get anything out of him. Being overly emotional at times ran in her bloodline, but at the same time Izuku could be sealed up tighter than Tartarus. There were just some things that Izuku didn't want out, and they were going to stay that way unless he said otherwise.

However, Izuku wasn't one to change his mind often. 

"Alright. I'll leave it on your bed. Be safe! Love you!"

"Love you, too." Izuku walked out the door and closed it behind him. He leaned back against the door and dragged his hand down his face. He didn't need to read the letter. It was just generic cookie-cutter questions with money paperclipped to the paper, just like every time. 

Izuku had passion for a lot of things. It was just a shame that he felt so empty whenever he got a letter from his father abroad. He appreciated everything the man did for them, but Izuku was no liar. So, he couldn't lie to himself and say he felt the same level of love for the man like he did for his mother. Not that he would ever admit that to her.

He made his way down the steps of his apartment building, making his daily trek to Kyouka's house. It was odd. He had barely known Kyouka for two months, and yet he felt like he knew her better and had a stronger connection to her than his own dad. 

True, he had latched onto Kyouka like a koala to a tree near instantly out of social starvation (and attraction), but his friendship with her was so strong that it was impossible to not draw some sort of comparison. Although, his relationship with Kyouka was entirely different from the relationship he should’ve had with his father. He didn't have a father figure. Well, besides All Mi-...

Izuku paused his train of thought and shook his head. That was an entirely different can of worms that he didn't feel like opening just then. Izuku cleared his mind and made his way to the train station. He didn’t have the time to focus on his father. He wasn’t there, and Izuku needed to focus on the things right in front of him. Like, relationships he *could* actually improve.

Like his newfound friendship with Uraraka and Iida. Or finally getting Kyoutoku to calm down his “Overprotective Father” act. Or maybe actually grow a pair and get together with Kyouka.

...Damn his low self-esteem.

***...~AIV~...***

**(Jirou Household: Kyouka's Bathroom)**

Kyouka closed her eyes as the hot water ran over her body for the last time before she turned off the water. Showers were a very mixed bag to her. On one hand, she absolutely loved how they felt. The only thing more relaxing to her was listening to music. One could only imagine how long she spent there whenever she played songs from her speaker on the sink counter. 

However, she hated when they ended. Of course, it meant she could no longer experience the euphoria of hot water and steam. But, it also meant she would have to look at her worst enemy. Kyouka slid the glass door over and looked across the bathroom to see her one true nemesis.

*The mirror.*

“Ugh.” Luckily she took hot showers with the door closed, so fog completely covered the reflective material. Kyouka quickly grabbed her towel and began drying herself off. Once she was done, she wrapped the towel around herself and grabbed her moisturizer as she walked into her bedroom. She looked over at her desk and grimaced at the mirror on her make-up table. Averting her eyes, Kyouka walked over to her bed and picked up her uniform. Suddenly, she heard her phone vibrate. Picking it up from her nightstand, she didn’t even try to guess who was texting her.

**\[The One I Have Far Too Many Nicknames For\]:** On my way over.

Well, that certainly brightened her mood. He always seemed to do that somehow. Things between the two of them were at an all-time high. Although, it seemed that every day that passed brought their relationship higher than it was before. But, Izuku was...a temporary boost.

He always made her feel so much better whenever he was around, but whenever Izuku, left her mind just reverted right back to its normal self. Izuku would always build upon a foundation, and every night it would fall. Kyouka really didn't feel like falling back into a pit of heart-clenching, hollow-gut, tightened lung emotions today. It was becoming tiring. Her gaze couldn’t help but look back towards her mirror. She remembered all of the compliments Izuku had thrown her way during their first outing together. She could remember the look in his eyes when he saw her. That day was actually one Kyouka had been thinking about more and more over the last few days. The green-haired dweeb lodged himself into her brain, and weaved his way down to her heart. 

She had already accepted it awhile back, but she really hadn't said it fully to herself.

Damn it, she was crazy about him.

Of course, that knowledge was already known. There was absolutely no way to deny it to herself or anybody else after the previous day.

The real question was: *‘Am I going to do anything about it?’*

Mika had already told her to go for it, but it wasn’t that simple. Kyouka wasn’t dumb. She knew that her relationship with Izuku had already reached the point of beginning to blur the line between friendship and dating. It was more than obvious during lunch the previous day. Kyouka had put her head on his shoulder, the two had simply sat in what was most likely the first long comfortable silence in either of their lives. Kyouka didn’t even know silence *could* be comfortable. She thought it was just a myth. But, lo and behold, they had simply sat against the wall. No jokes. No teasing. Just sitting and being happy in one another’s presence. 

She was closer to Izuku than she had ever been with anyone else. There were even times where she felt like she acted more herself with him than her own parents.

Which for most would be very strange due to the fact that she had only known Izuku for just about two months. It was odd to her as well, but Izuku just felt like someone who you could trust with your life. 

Well, it helped that one actually could trust Izuku with their life since he would rush in to save the day in a heartbeat. They were so attached from the beginning. For a couple of teenagers who weren't exactly social butterflies, one so much so that he thought a good icebreaker was asking if the other liked jazz music out of the blue, she felt that they were more than successful in their relationship.

The fact that he was an adorkable nerd/hunk was simply icing on the cake.

If Izuku could make her use the word "adorkable" twice, that had to mean something.

Izuku was just as trusting to her as she was to him. Kyouka had no problem telling him anything on her mind...for the most part. Her bodily issues were something that she didn’t think she would ever tell anybody. It was just one of those situations where she believed she just had to suck it up and carry on. What exactly was she going to do about it anyway?

She only had two things to hope for. The first thing was that her body wasn’t done developing yet and she still had room to grow. She was only 15, so there was still plenty of time for her body to undergo another big change. The second was only if the first possibility didn’t happen. Her hope was that Izuku was already satisfied with how she looked.

On one hand…

Kyouka sat down at her desk, tightening her towel around her. She looked into the mirror and frowned. *'**I don’t see that happening.’*

And, on the other hand, Izuku had expressed before that he thought she was good-looking. Hell, he had blatantly said multiple times that she was attractive while using many different adjectives to do so. It was just so hard to believe him. Her own mind was making her take every compliment with a grain of salt as to not get her hopes up. Besides, Izuku had only ever seen her dolled up in the best things she had. 

“UuuuuUUUUGH!” Kyouka slammed her head on her desk and rubbed her temples. “What the hell am I doing? I’m sitting here looking into the damn mirror and pondering about if a boy likes me, when it’s so freaking obvious that he does! How far have you fallen, Kyouka?”

Yeah, she knew. 

Izuku wasn't exactly subtle about it, and to be perfectly honest, she wasn't either. 

Did Izuku know, too? Probably not. Izuku may be a very intelligent young man, but he could be ignorant about a lot of things. They literally held hands on their first official hangout. It didn't really matter if he didn't think the feelings were reciprocated. If Kyouka was the one to say something first, he'd realize then. So, Izuku wasn't the problem. Her own self-esteem was the issue. Every time things began to look like it was heading one way, it immediately made her want to turn back. Her insecurity created its own reality most of the time. Kyouka could see one thing or opportunity, and then her brain decided that it was probably nothing.

She lifted her head back up and slid her hands down her face. “You know what? Screw it, I’ll just do it right now.”

She quickly grabbed her phone and opened up her texts. Kyouka pressed her thumbs to the phone to begin typing. Well, she would’ve if her hands hadn’t decided to simply lock up on her.

“C’mon, thumbs. Type!” Her thumbs didn’t budge. Kyouka tossed her phone away and put her head in her hands. In the blink of an eye her daily chest pain came back. Her stomach felt hollow and her mind became cloudy. She couldn’t. Fear and insecurity ambushed her heart once more. Every action that passed through her head was second guessed. She had lost control of her body, making zero shadow of a doubt into a literal veil of darkness. 

She hadn’t felt such discomfort and uncertainty since she tried to tell her parents that she didn’t want to be a musician. In fact, it was somehow worse. It had taken her three years to finally power through to tell her parents she wanted to be a hero. And, if this was somehow worse…

Kyouka shook her head. It wasn’t the right time or method anyway. A random text on the morning of their second day of school, a time where their attention needed to be fully focused on their education? She was actually glad she chickened out. That was *not* the way she wanted to confess, if at all. 

Would she even be able to make the relationship work? Izuku was...well, Izuku. He would do absolutely everything in his power to make sure Kyouka was the happiest girl alive. Kyouka just wasn’t sure if she could bring as much to the table as Izuku would. 

Whether it be emotionally…

She looked down at herself, not even bothering to remove her towel to look.

...or physically.

 Besides, if today was anything like their first, then she needed her wits about her. Oddly enough, Izuku would help. Once he arrived at her doorstep later, he would be able to clear her mind and help her feel better. Her thoughts wouldn’t overcome her with him around. 

She plugged her jack into her phone, turning up her music. Kyouka cracked her knuckles and stood up, making her way towards her uniform. "Suck it up, Kyouka."

***...~AIV~...***

**(Some Time Later: UA High School)**

“So, what crazy bullshit do you think they’ll have us do today, Mop-Top?” The two teens walked through the front doors of UA, making their way towards the classroom. 

“Oh, well I don’t know...”

Kyouka side-eyed Izuku, his expression was a bit strange. “Hey, you alright?”

Izuku ran a hand through his hair, shrugging his shoulders. “I’m fine, it’s just...I got a letter from my dad today.”

Kyouka sucked in her cheeks, instantly changing her demeanor. “What did it say?”

“I never opened it. But, I already know what it says. It’s just the same old stuff with money attached to the paper. How was school? Make any new friends? Et cetera, et cetera.”

Kyouka's jack gently poked his cheek, “It sounds to me like he’s trying to learn more about you.”

“One would think that, but what you don’t realize is that those are the exact same questions I’ve been answering since I was five. I don’t really see the point.” Kyouka sighed, not exactly knowing what to say. Izuku was always so hopeful and persevering. But, when it came to his dad, it was almost like he had given up. Like he was tired of putting any energy towards Hisashi and decided that his efforts were better suited elsewhere. 

Which, from a certain perspective, sounded practical. Why continue to linger on someone who’s never there, when you could be totally focused on the loved ones who are around? On the other hand, Izuku wasn’t the type of person to just excommunicate somebody.

Izuku shook his head, “Can we talk about this later? I would much rather just focus on school right now.”

Kyouka nodded, “Okay. I’m not going to act like I can fully understand it, so all I’ll say is I’m here for you.”

Izuku cracked a genuine smile, “I know. Thank you.”

They finally made it to the class with Izuku holding open the door for Kyouka. As soon as they both entered, Ochako and Tenya saw their friends and waved them over to their desks where they sat.

...Buuut, Mina grabbed onto Kyouka’s arm and dragged her back towards her desk where Tooru stood. 

Izuku chuckled as he waved to her, “I guess I’ll talk to you in a minute.”

“No! Save me now!” It was too late. Mina had already plopped the punk rocker down in the desk next to her own. Kyouka’s bored glared intensified as she gazed at her kidnappers. “You both remember that I’ve only known you for twenty-four hours, right? So, forgive me if I’m not exactly jumping at the chance to talk to you about my love-life.”

Mina nodded in understanding, "I know, I know. I actually just wanted to apologize for yesterday. I love myself some gossip, but I don't wanna force my way through someone's boundaries. However, I'll always offer my help if you ever desire it."

"If you haven’t noticed, I’m not exactly a stereotypical teenage girl trying to act out the sleepover scene from '*Grease' .* I…” Kyouka's eyes traveled past Mina to see Izuku talking to Iida and Uraraka. 

Uraraka was getting *awfully close* while excitedly talking about something. 

Mina followed Kyouka’s line of sight and smirked, “Like I said, I’ll help anytime you need it.”

Kyouka stood up from the chair and began walking over to her friends, but All Might suddenly burst through the door. **“I AM HERE, WALKING THROUGH THE DOOR LIKE A NORMAL PERSON!”**

Everyone immediately quieted down and quickly moved to their seats. Kyouka looked back at Izuku’s desk to see him excited, but not surprised like everyone else was. 

She gave him a knowing look that asked, *‘Did you know he’d be here today?’*

Izuku merely shrugged innocently. How Izuku knew that today was the day that All Might would show, she didn’t know. But, he was the ultimate fanboy. So, she just had to assume he had his sources.

**“Alright, everybody! I hope you’re all ready for your second day of school, because today we’re doing something very special! Today we’ll be doing…”** He paused for dramatic effect. **“BATTLE TRAINING!”** Everyone perked up in their seats, most noticeably Katsuki who suddenly grew an enormous and terrifying smile. **“But, you’re going to need these!”** Shelves of metal cases suddenly popped out of the wall, each one labeled with a number based on their desk number. **“Once changed, head on out to Ground Beta! AWAY I GO!!!”**

The hulking blonde man sprinted out of the classroom, leaving the students to grab their suitcases and change. The first out of the room was Katsuki, grabbing his case and sprinting after All Might with his sadistic still on his face. Everyone else excitedly followed him, Kyouka and Izuku lagging somewhat behind.

Kyouka smiled at him, suitcase in hand. “Let’s hope my help in the redesign didn’t make you look too stupid.”

“I’m just hoping that they were able to actually make your tech. We did send in our forms a little last minute.” 

“I’m sure it’ll be fine...I still can’t believe you kept the ears though.”

“They’re n-not ears!”

Kyouka raised her hands in defense, “Whatever you say. C’mon, let’s go.”

***...~AIV~...***

*‘What on Earth am I looking at?’* Kyouka looked around the locker room to see every one of the other girls in skin-tight outfits. Which wasn’t the weird part since lots of heroes, whether male or female, wore tight outfits. It was the fact that Kyouka was literally the only one whose costume wasn’t like that. 

And they all looked really good.

Ochako and Tsu looked a little embarrassed, but looked great. Mina was clearly proud of how she looked in her jumpsuit. Tooru was literally naked…Or was she even there? And Momo...Kyouka didn’t even know if what she was wearing was legal.

Kyouka looked down at her loose-fitting pants and oversized shirt. It wasn't that she exactly *wanted* to wear that sort of stuff. She liked at least some breathing room instead of being trapped in some sweaty unitard. 

She liked her costume. It was even more special due to the fact that Izuku helped her design it, at least partially. However, as she looked at the other girls in their outfits, it emphasized in her mind how she thought she looked...lacking. Kyouka shook her head, rolling back her shoulders and closing her eyes. She whispered, *"Izuku likes it, so it's fine. I like it, so it's fine. I look fine."* 

She closed her locker and began walking out the door while fastening the last of her gear into place, hardly believing a word of what she said.

***...~AIV~...***

**(Ground Beta Entrance)**

"You look amazing!"

Kyouka turned around to see her friend walk out of the entrance tunnel. She couldn't help but chuckle at his cowl, "And you still look like a rabbit."

Izuku stood before her with the basic original design still mainly present. He still had his green jumpsuit with white lines running down the arms and torso, his red shoes, and the white pads between the neck and shoulders.

 But, the light green was replaced with a forest green— "To go along with your pine tree hair," Kyouka had said— and his kneepads and elbow pads also had a white lines running down their centers. He had black shoulder pauldrons with a black strap across his chest keeping them together. They too had a large white accent line down the center. His utility belt had black material connecting the pouches.

No matter how hard Kyouka tried to persuade Izuku, he was persistent in keeping his cowl, even if he probably was never going to put it on. She was just happy that she convinced him to get rid of the teeth on his mouth guard. 

His white gloves had hard plastic on the knuckles. Kyouka had persisted that it would make his hits harder and prevent bruising. Izuku was afraid of hurting someone more than intended, but Kyouka eventually won in the end with the argument of Izuku already having a power that can obliterate someone with the flick of his finger. And, the only amount of power he could control wouldn't be able to take down the really big bad guys. So, some hardened knuckles weren't exactly going to detriment him.

"But, you do look a lot cooler than originally...Could use more black, though."

"I'll think about it. But, look at you!" Izuku chuckled, gesturing towards her outfit. Kyouka stood in black pants, a peach shirt with tears at the bottom. Her original black jacket was replaced with a midriff black leather jacket with a buckle at the top and bottom, a purple soundwave design running down her left arm. She still had her speaker boots, but along with them were red speaker gauntlets and headphones. "You look so awesome!"

![](https://img.wattpad.com/f541580172306c305830e94bf0e233b596ab22f3/68747470733a2f2f73332e616d617a6f6e6177732e636f6d2f776174747061642d6d656469612d736572766963652f53746f7279496d6167652f6f4a4144636972476238445333673d3d2d38332e313633666435333262633263373764353231353635313136343131352e6a7067?s=fit&w=720&h=720)

Kyouka blushed, "Thanl—"

"Nice costumes, you guys!" The duo turned to see their duo turn into a quartet. Iida looked like a walking engine...which sort of went against him being a speed demon when she thought about it, him wearing heavy armor and all. But, whatever. Ochako marched up to them wearing her costume, and that was where Kyouka began to worry again. She hadn't even thought about the fact that one of the girls wearing a skintight outfit would be near Izuku all of the time. Ochako rubbed the back of her head, a little embarrassed, "I should've been more specific on my forms. This costume is skintight."

*'Thanks for pointing that out,'* Kyouka deadpanned. She looked over to Izuku, her heart beating in slight nervousness. Izuku...didn't even care. In fact, Kyouka was pretty sure Izuku hadn't even looked any other girl's way. She could already fill a swimming pool with the amount of saliva the grape-headed kid and the Pikachu-looking guy had drooled out when Momo walked out of the tunnel. *'Izuku, you're so strange.'*

It was probably only a matter of time. All it took was a quick glance and Izuku would be all over that bubbly brunette in day's time. Kyouka grimaced and mentally slapped herself. *'*

*No. He's not like those guys.'* She glanced at Uraraka and her costume once more, and then down at herself. *'...But, I'm not like her.'*

"You okay, Kyouka?"

Kyouka jumped in surprise, finally noticing Izuku was looking right at her. "Y-Yeah, I'm good. Just a little nervous." 

"I thought that was my schtick," he smiled. She lightly nudged his side, both of them chuckling.

From afar, Toshinori waited for the rest of the class to arrive on the battlefield. He watched as his pupil was socializing with a group of other students, happy that Young Midoriya was breaking out of his comfort zone a little. There was one strange thing, however. 

Who was the girl?

Not Young Uraraka. He remembered the young girl from Izuku’s entrance exam and how she tried to give him her points. But, who was the purple-haired girl? Midoriya had been talking to her during their quirk apprehension tests, too. Normally, Toshinori wouldn’t have really questioned it. In fact, he would’ve been downright elated. Izuku getting over his reluctance for social interaction, and with a girl too? Fantastic! But, this quickly? Did Izuku already know this girl from somewhere? It didn’t seem likely since as far as Toshinori knew, Izuku didn’t have any friends.

...And now that he really thought about it, he realized he probably should have asked about that a long time ago.

If Izuku somehow did know this girl from before starting U.A, why didn’t his pupil tell him? Toshinori knew he had been busy getting ready for UA, and that he and Izuku hadn’t been able to really meet up for a while. Toshinori just thought that Midoriya would be jumping at the chance to tell his mentor that he made a friend. Midoriya’s focus was also *completely* on Kyouka. He did respond to Uraraka and Iida whenever they spoke, but Izuku would always revert right back to focusing on her. The same went for Kyouka. It was like they were in their own little world, just barely communicating with the outside for short intervals. All Might watched as the cycle went on, then seeing Kyouka laugh at something Izuku said, with Izuku blooming a heavy blush on his cheeks as he watched her laugh.

*‘Ooooooh...Young Midoriya, my boy, I’m honestly surprised. I didn’t expect this, especially not so soon in the year.’* The last of the class finally came out, not allowing All Might to think about it any longer. However, he was determined to ask Izuku about it later. 

**“Looking sharp, everyone!”** Everyone turned their attention towards their teacher as he began to explain the training they would be doing. Kyouka sort of zoned out as the rest of the class began asking question after question. She was only brought out of her daydreaming when All Might was suddenly in front of her holding a box. **“Your turn, young lady.”**

She reached inside of the box and grabbed a piece of paper, opening it up to find the English letter “G” on it. 

“Hey, Midoriya! We’re partners!” Kyouka perked up and turned to see Ochako excitedly bounce up to Izuku, both of them holding pieces of paper with the letter “A”. 

Kyouka blew a raspberry and rolled her eyes, *‘Wow. Thanks, Universe. You’re really helping me out here. What next?’* Someone tapped her shoulder, and she turned around to see the Pikachu guy smiling at her while holding up a piece of paper with another “G”. *‘...Fuck you, Universe.’*

Izuku looked back at Kyouka and internally grimaced. It was the guy that was friends with Mineta, perving on the rest of the girls. Well, until they insulted Kyouka.

...Okay, Kaminari wasn’t the one that said those things about her. But, he didn’t particularly know Kaminari all that well, but yesterday was enough for Izuku to know that he didn’t like Kyouka being around him. He was probably a nice guy, but the churning in his stomach was trying to convince him otherwise. At least it was better than her being paired up with Mineta, a fate with Izuku felt really bad that Momo was dealt. *‘Just great. What next?’*

**“Alright! Team A is the heroes and Team D is the villains!”**

...He was facing Katsuki.

While his classmates couldn’t hear it, Izuku was internally screaming.

***...~AIV~...***

“You okay there, Midoriya?”

Izuku looked over to Ochako, who had concern etched onto her face. They were sitting outside of the test building, using their prep time to memorize the building's blueprints. “Y-Yeah, I’m fine. I’m just a little nervous about going up against Kacchan. I’m sure Iida will be formidable, too. We just need to be careful.”

“Kacchan? You mean Bakugou, right? The one that was a jerk to you...Well, basically to everyone, but mostly to you.”

Izuku nodded with a shaky breath, “Kaachan may be a…Okay, he’s a complete asshole. But, no one can deny his skills and tenacity are amazing. He’s stronger and more confident than me.”

Ochako pursed her lips and tilted her head, “I’d say his confidence is actually a bad thing at this point.”

“True, but he still has so much over me. However, it just makes me even more driven to beat him.” 

Ochako put a hand on Izuku’s shoulder, smiling bright. “He can say whatever he wants. We’ll still beat him.”

Izuku smiled back and nodded, putting his cowl on and beginning to walk into the building.

***...~AIV~...***

Back in the observation room, Kyouka squinted at the television screen as she watched the interaction go down between her two friends. She knew it wasn’t actually anything to be worried about. Hell, she knew Ochako wasn’t a threat to begin with. It was just...difficult. It was difficult to not feel like her stomach was twisting around. Kyouka wasn’t someone who got jealous easily. She had a lot of things that others sadly didn’t have, and she was grateful. Izuku was one of those things.

She just didn’t think about the fact that she would have to share.

No one told her just how much she would have to share, though. Maybe she could have 95% percent of him, and everyone else could have the rest. That seemed fair to her. She was exaggerating, of course, but...I mean, still a fair deal, right?

“Hey, so you and Midoriya know each other, right? Like, before UA?”

Kyouka turned her attention to Kaminari, who stood next to her. “Uh, yeah. He’s my best friend. Why?"

"Nothing. Just wondering." Kyouka suddenly noticed that Denki had grown somewhat nervous at her answer. His eyes shifting around, a bead of sweat running down his forehead. "...Sooo, uh, by any chance did Midoriya mention why he left the cafeteria yesterday?"

Kyouka was suddenly suspicious, peering up at the boy, "Actually, he did mention something about not liking the conversation. Something about hormonal boys talking about girls."

"O-Oh. Well, I can't imagine why."

Kyouka smirked, "Did you know that my quirk gives me heightened hearing? For instance, I can hear someone's heartbeat stutter when they lie."

"...I see. U-Uh...Oh! Would you look at that! Bakugou's about to attack Midoriya!" As much as Kyouka knew it was Denki's way of avoiding the conversation, she also realized that he was correct. Katsuki had just tried to sneak attack the duo. Izuku had jumped out of the way, grabbing Ochako as he went.

***...~AIV~...***

"Nice dodging, Deku."

Izuku took down his now half-torn cowl and stood up straight. *'Of course he'd come right for me. Just as planned.'*

Katsuki's sadistic smile became wider as he approached Izuku. "I still don't know how you got a quirk or got into UA, but I guess it doesn't matter right now. You're still Deku. I'll mess you up just enough to not get disqualified!" 

The blonde threw a right hook at Izuku, only for Izuku to power up Full Cowl and slide into his opening. He grabbed Katsuki's arm, putting it over his shoulder and heaving the blonde over him. His powered-up body's new speed and strength allowed for a quicker and harder take down. Katsuki slammed into the ground, the tile cracking underneath him. The blonde gasped as all of the air left his lungs. 

***...~AIV~...***

**(The Observation Room)**

"Hell yeah!" While most were surprised and invested in the fight, a few heads did turn towards Kyouka's outburst. Namely Denki, Mina, and All Might, with the last two smirking a little. Kyouka crossed her arms and looked away with a small blush.

***...~AIV~...***

**(Back at the Fight)**

"Uraraka, go! You know what to do!" The brunette nodded, running away from the two and heading towards her goal. Izuku turned back to Katsuki, who was struggling to stand up as he coughed. "You always lead your fights with a right hook. I've seen it enough to know."

Katsuki's glare intensified as he looked Izuku in the eye, "That supposed to impress me?"

"I've analyzed so many heroes, including you. All of it written down in the notebooks you thought were so worthless. I'm not...I *refuse* to be your worthless punching bag anymore! Someone very important to me told me that no matter what I think of myself, I'm not useless. Not anymore. You're gonna see exactly what I'm made of, and what I can be. You can keep calling me Deku, because that's a compliment. I’m Deku: The Hero that can do anything!”

“You spout all of that stupid crap, yet you’re still scared. It pisses me off!”

Izuku took a deep breath and moved his shoulders back. He thought about Kyouka’s words to him whenever she changed the meaning of Deku. He remembered everything she had ever said about him. He looked Katsuki in the eyes, brought up his fists, and widened his stance. 

"I'm not afraid of you anymore."

Was that a lie? Just a little. But, that was a lot better than before a couple months ago. 

"The fuck did you just say to me?"

"I'm not afraid of you anymore! I've always said I never wanted to compete against you." Izuku crouched down, ready to leap. "I lied!" 

Izuku rushed at Katsuki, his body much faster than normal. Katsuki jumped at Izuku to blast him, but he dived down and avoided him. Katsuki blasted forward, propelling himself back at Izuku. The hero didn't have time to dodge, just barely having time to cross his arms over his chest in an attempt to block. In midair, Katsuki swiveled around and blasted Izuku back. 

Deku fell on his back and slid down the hallway until he slammed into the wall. 

Katsuki sprinted towards Izuku, readying his next attack. Izuku jumped up to meet him, blocking a jumping kick from the blonde. Suddenly, Katsuki felt something wrap tightly around his leg. He suspected it was Izuku trying to grab onto him. So, he blasted him in the chest, sending Izuku sprawling backwards.

***~"*** ***Bakugou has been captured!"~***

Katsuki stopped in his tracks, yelling at the intercom. "The fuck are you talking about!?!"

***~"First, language. Second, check your ankle."~***

Katsuki looked down to see the capture tape tied around his ankle. "Wh-...WHAT!!!"

He thought back to the small fight that had happened. The kick. That freckle-faced bastard had tied the tape around him in that split second.

...No.

...Fuck. That.

Izuku smiled to himself. If it wasn’t for his new speed, he never would have been able to tie the tape around Katsuki.

***~"Young Bakugou, please exit the building and head on back."~*** However, Katsuki didn't move a muscle. **~*****"...Young Bakugou?"~***

"RAAAAH!" Katsuki had suddenly rocketed towards Izuku, explosions propelling him forward. Izuku's eyes widened as Katsuki tackled Izuku through the wall. The two tumbled through the dust and rock, stopping with Izuku on his back and Katsuki above him. 

Izuku struggled in Katsuki's grip, the blonde’s hands burning his chest. "What're you doing, Kaachan?!"

"You...You...You can't win! You never fucking win! You're Deku!"

"Thank you."

Katsuki's words died in his mouth as he did a double-take, "I-...What?"

*\*Crack\**

Izuku slammed his fist into Katsuki's face, sending the blonde away. Izuku slowly got up while clutching his chest, still in pain from the tackle and the burns. "I told you, Deku was a compliment."

"Gggrah! I bet you had so much fun hiding your quirk from me all those years! You’re supposed to be nothing! A pebble! A bug I can crush! You've been mocking me for all those years." 

**~"** ***Young Bakugou, what are you doing! You're captured! You're no longer permitted to fight! STOP THIS AT ONC-"~***

"It's fine!" All Might faltered as Izuku's shout cut him off. "You said this was a simulation. Well, villains escape custody all the time."

***~"This isn't part of the simulation!"~***

Kyouka suddenly shoved All Might out of the way and grabbed the microphone, her jack going up to All Might’s earpiece, "Izuku, you know I believe in you and all, but this isn't exactly the time to suddenly have a burst of confidence."

"It'll be fine. You can't stop him anyway. This needs to happen. And, you're wrong, Kacchan. I was never mocking you. But, I beat you here, fair and square. If you really want to see just how wrong you are about me then...th-then...then come at me!"

"You wanna fight me?" Katsuki shot up, putting his finger in the pin of his gauntlet as his grin widened, "...*Good."*

***~"Young Bakugou, if you pull that pin, then the consequences will be severe! I can almost guarantee you won't be returning to this school tomorrow!"~***

Katsuki paused, his gaze never left Izuku. Everyone was actually surprised that it was taking him so long to actually contemplate the ultimatum he was given. But, soon Katsuki lowered his arm, turning around and walking away in silence. While there was still anger on his face, there was sort of a dead look in his eye. As soon as he was out of sight, Izuku let out a breath of relief and put his hands on his knees. “O-Oh thank goodness. Why did I do that?"

*“Midoriya? What’s going on down there?”*

Izuku pressed a finger to his earpiece, responding to Ochako, “Uh...Something that I’ll likely have to deal with the consequences of at a later date. Where are you? Did you find Iida?”

*“Yeah, but he saw me. Sorry. But, uh...I’m kinda glad. You should come see this. Iida is getting super into it.”*

Izuku nodded, “I’ll be there as soon as possible."

Before Izuku ran off to find Ochako, he looked back at where Katsuki disappeared. He was happy that the fight ended quickly and with little damage done, but losing in such a way just wasn’t a part of Katsuki’s code...Okay, well losing in general wasn’t a part of Katsuki’s coding. But, to not only lose by simple capture tape, but to be caught by Deku of all people…

Izuku had a bad feeling about this.

***...~AIV~...***

**(15 Minutes Later)**

The rest of the battle was fairly straightforward. Iida didn’t last too long with both Izuku and Uraraka going against him. The group made it back to the observation room, and Izuku was met with three things.

1\. No Bakugou in sight.

2\. Everyone began congratulating him.

3\. Kyouka’s hand coming right for his arm.

*\*SLAP\**

“Ow!”

*\*Jab\**

“Ah!” Izuku clutched his shoulder as Kyouka’s jack stabbed into it. “Why?!”

“What is the matter with you?! Really?! Instigating a fight with that psychopath?”

“...W-Well, technically he started i-” Kyouka's glare only intensified. “Shutting up.” 

All Might cleared his throat to get their attention, **“Ahem, if you two wouldn’t mind I think we should start the grading.”**

“Wait,” Izuku said, looking around the room. “Where’s Kaachan?”

**“Well, since this is his first time acting out and it didn’t get too out of hand, I sent him off with a warning. But, he stomped out claiming he needed to go to the bathroom. Either he’s not coming back for the rest of class, or he does come back and the bathroom will be nothing but ash.”**

Kyouka lifted a brow, “Um, this wasn’t his first time acting out.”

**“...What?”**

“Yeah, he attacked Izuku yesterday, too. Or, well he tried, but Aizawa stopped him and gave him a warning.”

All Might looked down in concern, **“Oh...well, technically I don’t have the right to punish him anyway. That’s Aizawa’s job. I’ll have to speak to him later. But, let us move on. Can anyone tell us who the MVP of the match was?”**

As Momo suddenly began to speak out, Kyouka nudged Izuku’s side. He leaned down to hear her as she whispered, *“Look, sorry that I hit you. Well, a little sorry.”*

*“...You’re not sorry at all, are you?”*

*“Nope. But, I just want you to know that I’m also majorly proud of you. Not that I’m condoning instigating the anger of a violent psycho and picking fights, but I’m still really really proud. You showed that dick how awesome you really are. Maybe he’ll finally pull his head out of his own ass and stop being such a jerk.”*

Izuku almost laughed, *“Actually, he’s probably just going to be even angrier than before.”*

*“You just have the worst luck, don’t you?”*

*“Eh, it’s not so bad. My luck let me find you, so you won’t hear me complaining.”*

Kyouka flung her head back, *“Can we never have just one conversation where we don’t suddenly turn it into some heartfelt mushfest.”*

*“That’s like asking me not to breathe. It’s quite literally one of the only three ways I know how to communicate. Which is actually a major improvement from my original one of stuttering through every single word.”* Momo finished her explanation with Iida being MVP, just barely beating Izuku and Ochako purely for his dedication to the simulation. Izuku and Kyouka went to the back of the group, his notebook out and ready to write down everything he saw about the next group. As Todoroki and Shoji were sent out, Kyouka turned to Izuku.

“Hey, I need to ask you something before I get sent out with Pikachu.”

“Hm?” Izuku hummed, still somewhat concentrated on his notebook.

“...What did they say at the lunch table yesterday that made you so pissed off?”
