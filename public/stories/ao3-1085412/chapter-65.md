"Thank you, Remus." Narcissa carefully tucked her personal quill into her handbag and gave thanks that the monthly meeting to review the Malfoy expenditure was over.

It still galled her to have to meet with the werewolf but she was pleased with Lupin's business-like but respectful approach. He never made her feel that she was being interrogated and the questions he did ask were all pertinent. She was also pleased that he provided her with statements and briefs regarding the Malfoy estate, and that he asked for her opinions on investments and business deals. She knew more than she had before when Lucius had handled the finances. Indeed, it could be argued that the werewolf was doing better than Lucius – their investment income had already doubled since putting the werewolf in charge and with their outgoings restricted to a modest level, their savings were accumulating for the first time in years.

"One final item." Lupin pulled a sheet of parchment and a small key from his document pouch. "Sirius has made arrangements for a vault to fund the expenses for the baby such as a nursery, clothes, toys, and so on."

Narcissa barely kept her face expressionless. She had wondered how she was going to manage the baby related shopping on the budget they had agreed for usual expenditure but had decided to raise it at the next meeting. She took the parchment warily. "Did the funds come from the main vault? I don't remember seeing the deduction on the statement."

"Sirius has funded this from the Black vaults." Lupin smiled wolfishly, his pleasure at disconcerting her all too evident. "He tells me it's a Black tradition for the primary House to take care of these things."

It was but she hadn't expected Sirius to comply with the tradition. In hindsight she wasn't sure why – Sirius had proven to support a number of Black and pureblood traditions since he'd taken up the Lordship. He was also teaching them to Harry. It made her wonder whether Sirius really had hated everything to do with the Blacks or whether he had simply hated the madness and blood superiority extremism of his mother and father. If only he hadn't fallen in with James Potter and gone to Gryffindor…

"I will convey my thanks to my cousin personally." Narcissa conveyed to Lupin coolly. She was happy with the vault; it was more than enough for her to substantially redecorate a suite of rooms and to buy enough new items for the baby with galleons left over. She folded the parchment, tucked the key away into her purse and made to leave.

Lupin stood and helped her into her cloak. "I'll see you out."

"There's no need." Narcissa said firmly. While the pretence of Lupin providing steward services to the House of Malfoy was enough to stem gossip, she had no wish to be seen with the werewolf outside of formal family occasions. Additionally, while fervour had calmed down over Lupin's lycanthropy with the Wizengamot session the previous day and the revelations of Wenlock's criminality, she wasn't certain she would be safe in his presence should someone take exception to him.

As though he'd read her thoughts, Lupin winced. "Yes, probably for the best in the circumstances. Sirius would not want me to place you in any danger."

Narcissa waved him back into his seat with a muttered confirmation that she'd see him later at the family dinner at Hogwarts. She exited the Gringotts conference room, gave a nod of farewell to her niece who apparently was on guard duty still, (wondering vaguely why Dora had chosen to remain outside the room), and headed for the main hall.

She entered to hear the shrill tone of a woman protesting by the farthest counter. She ignored it. Whatever drama was happening Narcissa would not lower herself to be interested. She started to draw on her gloves and headed for the exit with a grimace.

The January weather was rainy, cold and miserable. She'd order one of Kreacher's hot chocolates when she got back to the Manor, she mused, but despite the weather she needed to shop for a while. Her figure was changing and it was time to invest in some maternity wear; something fashionable but something that would also enable her to be discreet about her condition.

"Wait!"

Narcissa frowned at the call and turned back slightly, uncertain it was meant for her. The fast approaching Lady Alexandria Wenlock, clearly heading toward her, had her freezing in place and fingering her wand although she knew she couldn't use it within Gringotts. She caught the hastening figures of a matronly woman and a young man hurrying behind Alexandria and quickly identified them as Christopher Wenlock, the Heir and oldest son, and Katherine de Ware, Alexandria's sister. Narcissa contemplated leaving but had no wish to see herself pursued into the alley. She straightened and tilted her chin upwards a touch.

"Alexandria." Narcissa coolly greeted the other woman as she came to an abrupt halt in front of her.

"Don't Alexandria me as though nothing was wrong! What is the meaning of this?!" Alexandria waved a parchment in front of Narcissa's face, obscuring her view of the otherwise attractive and fashionable brunette whose Slavic heritage told in her high cheekbones and graceful lines.

Christopher caught hold of the parchment and yanked it out of his mother's hands. "My apologies, Madame Malfoy. My mother and I have had some distressing news and she is overwrought."

Alexandria huffed and shook off the comforting hand her sister tried to restrain her with. "I am not overwrought! This is all the fault of that blood traitor and his horrid boy! I demand justice! I demand…"

"Madame," the goblin who interrupted her was well-armoured and carried a spear, "you are disturbing the peace of Gringotts. If you have no further business I suggest you take this outside!"

Alexandria bristled. "No further business!" Her voice rose shrilly, "No further business! I'll have you…"

"Mother!" Christopher snapped. "Remember where we are!"

"And who you insult." Narcissa said frostily. She may have held similar views about her cousin and Harry prior to the resurgence of the House of Black but she was content with their leadership and their power. They had certainly trounced Wenlock most comprehensively.

"My apologies, Madame Malfoy." Christopher said, his dark eyes sincere although his cheeks were flushed with embarrassment. "My mother did not mean her remarks."

"Do not…"

"Quiet, Mother." Christopher demanded sharply, and the order of an Heir rang out in his tone as he turned to glare her into submission. She subsided with a glower. Christopher turned back to Narcissa. "Once again, I offer my apologies, Madame Malfoy, and I realise my House owes you no favours but perhaps you could assist us in locating Lord Black? It seems yesterday's events concerning my father had consequences that we could not foresee." He handed her the parchment.

Narcissa stared at him for a long moment, determining whether to even look at the missive. But she could see nothing sly in his expression and so dropped her gaze to read the parchment with well-hidden curiosity.

"*Gringotts has registered the magical surrender of the House of Wenlock to the Houses of Potter and Black. All vaults and property have been seized. Further inquiries should be directed to the Steward for the Houses of Potter and Black."*

Merlin.

She'd heard of magical surrender in the traditional folk lore that her father, mother and tutors had crammed into the heads of the Black sisters but she had never witnessed it. Until now, Narcissa reminded herself. An image of the silver vulture of Wenlock bowing to Harry the day before flitted through her mind. It was monumental and had the potential to give them a political and magical advantage like no other.

She glanced back up at the young man in front of her. "Come with me." She didn't wait for him nor did she pay attention to the hissed protest of Alexandria which was once again overruled by her son. She strode back into the hall, ignoring the wide-eyed stares of nosy on-loookers and the goblins' grumpy disgust at the whole affair. She made her way back to the antechamber Remus occupied.

Dora straightened immediately as they approached and Narcissa could see her training in the easy fighting stance. "What's this about?"

"The Wenlocks need to see the Potter and Black Steward." Narcissa said crisply.

"He's with Madame Tonks." Dora replied a little uncomfortably.

Narcissa arched an eyebrow at the news that her sister was with Lupin. It made her wonder whether her sister and her husband had been subjected to the same financial restrictions as the Malfoys but that seemed unlikely since they had committed no crimes against the House of Black in Sirius's eyes. Perhaps Andromeda was simply taking advantage of the House steward to get some business tips. But why was Dora still outside the room? Some antiquated notion of professionalism no doubt, she surmised.

"Give him this." Narcissa pushed the parchment into Dora's hand. She was almost impressed by the scathing glare her niece aimed at her before she bent her head and read the parchment. The immediate response of knocking swiftly on the door and entering on Lupin's calm command was proof of the missive's explosive content.

The door closed and Narcissa found herself standing in the corridor with the Wenlocks. She briefly considered leaving but a part of her was too curious at the outcome; too tempted into staying to influence events.

"This is unacceptable!" Alexandria hissed at her son.

"Alexandria, please do stop making a scene." Her sister reprimanded her softly. "We are fortunate Narcissa was willing to parley on our behalf especially after the irreprehensible actions of your husband." Her tone gave away that she knew they now owed the Malfoys and the House of Black for such and Narcissa felt a curl of satisfaction. The de Wares were European nobility and had connections throughout a number of countries; it could only be to the benefit of the House of Black.

The door reopened and Dora ushered them inside. Narcissa's eyes widened almost imperceptibly. The room was no longer the small cosy office that she had occupied during her review but a larger space. The small table she and Lupin had shared was extended into a full conference table and Lupin directed the Wenlocks to the far side. Narcissa made her way swiftly to her sister's side, greeting her smoothly and inwardly approving of the neat bronze robes Andromeda was wearing.

Lupin cleared his throat as Dora made to step outside. "You are welcome to remain inside, Auror Tonks?"

"It's best I guard the entry to the room, Steward Lupin." Dora said firmly and stepped out once again.

The formality had Andromeda and Narcissa exchanging sisterly looks of concern. The werewolf and her niece usually had a warm flirtatious relationship. Had they argued?

Lupin motioned at Narcissa. "May I prevail upon you to perform the introductions?"

She inclined her head and smartly announced everyone.

Lupin gestured for them all to sit. "I have requested Auror Tonks sends for Lord Black." He tapped the parchment in front of him. "I believe only he has the authority to make any kind of decision regarding this." He looked chagrined. "I'm afraid the official Potter and Black copy must be in my correspondence folder. Kipbold handed me a stack of parchment this morning but I've been in meetings all morning."

"While we wait for Lord Black, perhaps some refreshments?" Andromeda stepped in smoothly.

A moment later, a house elf arrived with a silver tea tray filled with a matching pot, sugar bowl and milk jug. A stack of delicate china cups stamped with the Potter crest were balanced precariously alongside them.

Narcissa gave thanks that her niece hadn't been required to carry it in. The girl was clumsy on a good day. She sat politely as Andromeda played Mother and poured. The tea occupied Narcissa's hands and gave her a focus other than Alexandria's pinched white face.

She felt a flicker of sympathy for the woman. Sirius and Harry had decimated Wenlock's political career and Wenlock's own criminality had ensured the rest of his downfall. Of course, if he'd done it correctly he would never have been caught. Lucius had at least mostly covered his tracks until pinned down by the House of Black primacy and a Lord Black he'd never anticipated.

But then no-one ever anticipated Sirius, Narcissa thought with a twinge of amusement.

Talk of the Devil…

Sirius swept into the room with an air of implacable authority that Arcturus would have been proud of; dressed head to toe in black, his open robes revealed the leather trouser, black shirt combination that had the witches of the Wizengamot drooling and the wizards remembering they were in the presence of a battle mage.

Lupin immediately handed over the parchment while making a set of introductions that Sirius barely attended to since he was reading.

"Well, this is unexpected." Sirius said as he took his seat at the top of table. "Have any of us heard of this before?"

Narcissa exchanged a quick glance with her sister and gave way at Andromeda's signal that she would answer.

"Father told us of an old tradition which had similar themes of Houses surrendering their magic to the will of another but it was usually a Head of House's explicit consensual and considered actions that led to such a state." Andromeda said crisply, a slight lecturing air to her demeanour which had Narcissa nostalgic for her childhood and feeling a pang of grief that Bella wasn't there to roll her eyes at in shared amusement and indulgence of their sister.

"It could be argued that Lord Wenlock did undertake such an action yesterday." Narcissa cut in before Sirius replied.

Sirius motioned for her to continue, his grey eyes flinty and narrowed.

"Lord Wenlock swore upon his family magic to answer Lord Potter's question truthfully." Narcissa reminded Sirius quickly. "He effectively placed the House of Wenlock under the authority of the House of Potter when he did so – a pseudo-surrender so to speak."

"So when Wenlock attempted to lie and the magic forced him to speak truthfully, the family magic deemed he'd actually surrendered?" Sirius nodded briefly. "It's an explanation." He ignored the bristling indignation of the Wenlocks on his right, and glanced toward Lupin, silently asking for his opinion.

"It's a good theory. It would explain why the vulture bowed to Harry." Lupin commented, his finger tracing the rim of his cup. "I'd forgotten about that."

Narcissa sipped her own tea. It was a working theory.

Christopher squirmed in his chair and raised a hand to catch their attention. "I just want to say, Lord Black, that the rest of the family had no idea of my father's criminal actions. We knew Father wasn't happy about the move to review the laws on Creatures but we never considered he would go further than the usual political manoeuvrings."

Sirius's grey gaze landed on the Heir of Wenlock speculatively. "How old are you, Mister Wenlock?"

"Seventeen." Christopher replied, red darkening his cheeks even as his chin lifted a little in stubborn challenge.

Lupin frowned. "Aren't you part of the Durmstrang delegation for the tournament?"

"Yes," Christopher nodded, "myself, my brother and sister are all at Durmstrang. In fact that's one of the reasons why we were so surprised about Father. He has always been somewhat dismissive of his obligations and duties here in Britain."

"We have determined as a family to return to our home abroad." Alexandria broke in sharply. "We came to organise our finances with the goblins and…" she motioned at the parchment.

Lupin turned again to Christopher. "Have you tried to invoke your family magic since yesterday?"

It looked for a long moment that Christopher would ignore Lupin, or worse insult him, but finally he settled for violently shaking his head.

"Right." Sirius sighed. He gestured at the Heir ring. "You should try."

Christopher took a deep breath and called on his family magic.

Nothing happened.

"You try, Sirius." Lupin suggested.

Sirius pushed back from the table and directed his ring to the floor beside him. "Familius magicus."

Three totems shimmered into being; the snake of the House of Black, the griffin of the House of Potter, and the vulture of the House of Wenlock.

"Well, that's new." Sirius said, staring at the silver vulture.

"So you have stolen the family magic of my children; denied them their legacy." Alexandria said bitterly.

Sirius drew himself up and she shrank back, dropping her gaze as a dull flush coloured her cheeks. Narcissa hid her smile, pleased at Sirius's silent chastisement of the woman.

"Forgive my mother, please." Christopher jumped in hurriedly. "It is a stressful time."

"Very well; I won't take insult this time as I realise you're all under a lot of pressure after Lord Wenlock's behaviour came to light yesterday and this entire experience cannot be easy for you." Sirius said sternly. "But let's be straight here: there is nobody to blame for this state of affairs but him. Clearly your family magic no longer wants to align itself with your line."

"What does that actually mean?" asked Christopher.

Sirius glanced over at Lupin. "Remus?"

"I'm only speculating as there is more unknown about family magic than known in truth but…" Lupin lifted the parchment, "Lord Wenlock had taken a vow to protect all in the Wizengamot but forced under a family magic truth spell he revealed he'd harmed someone present." He explained. "That coupled with the belief we have that family magic originated in an oath to protect the wizarding world, and I believe the magic determined he was an oath-breaker."

Narcissa could not disagree with Lupin's theory; it had merit and not just because it was in line with her own thinking.

"Judgement." Sirius said briskly. "If the family magic decided in that moment to Judge…" he shrugged, "the most common punishment is to strip magic from those found guilty of oath-breaking."

"We should probably check in with Amelia and see whether Lord Wenlock has any magic today." Lupin said quietly.

The Wenlocks sat looking perfectly horrified.

"I can believe that you're right but Judgement is usually limited is it not to the guilty? Why did the family magic surrender to the House of Potter? Why not simply skip to the next generation?" asked Andromeda, waving at Christopher.

"I think my sister and nephew would like to know the answers to those questions too." Katherine spoke up again. She had placed a comforting and restraining hand on her sister's shoulder as Lupin had expounded on his theory.

"That I don't know." Lupin admitted. "It's possibly a combination of Judgement and Lord Wenlock being under oath to Harry at the time he was Judged."

Narcissa understood immediately. "When Lord Wenlock broke faith the family magic determined that the surrender was owed to Harry."

Lupin frowned and nodded. "But it's all conjecture. Either way this is not an outcome any of us could have foreseen."

"The question is what now?" asked Katherine. She waved at the parchment Lupin still held. "That suggests that effectively the House of Wenlock has been placed in service to the House of Potter."

"I'm afraid that's the upshot." Lupin said succinctly. He managed to sound apologetic.

Alexandria maintained her composure but only just; she went white as a sheet. Christopher remained composed though and contemplative.

"I'll need to check but I would assume that the Wizengamot has received a similar notification from magic." Lupin continued. "I suspect the proxy for the House of Wenlock will fall to the House of Potter."

Narcissa sipped her tea, another curl of satisfaction in her belly at just how thoroughly the House of Wenlock had been defeated by Harry.

"This cannot be considered just!" Alexandria exclaimed, slapping the table. "It strips the entire family of everything!"

"I don't disagree with you," Sirius answered sharply, "the sins of one man should not be paid for by his entire family."

Narcissa stopped herself from the eye-roll. Sirius still could be such a Gryffindor.

"However, clearly magic does not agree with either of us." Sirius finished, surprising Narcissa and everyone else in the room. "Even if I had a mind to reverse this, I wouldn't know how to convince magic to do it."

Christopher cleared his throat. "I am not averse to swearing an oath of service in truth to the House of Potter."

Narcissa only just managed to conceal her surprise. Andromeda raised an eyebrow. Sirius looked faintly amused at the turn of the events while Lupin looked suitably shocked.

"Christopher!" Alexandria looked horrified.

"No, Mother." Christopher raised a hand when she would have continued to berate him. "My politics are not Father's. I am not interested in becoming the next political powerhouse in British society." He grimaced. "Why would I? You and Father have never spent time here beyond what is necessary and Alexander, Anne and I are schooled elsewhere."

Alexandria frowned heavily. "But your legacy?" She demanded tightly. "And what of your sister and brother? Are they to be cast out of school and into service too?"

"Alex!" Katherine regarded her nephew carefully. "I believe Christopher is trying to safeguard all of you if you will let him speak."

Christopher nodded in gratitude to his aunt and turned back to Sirius. "Lord Black, as I have stated, I have no political ambition. I had already spoken to my siblings some months ago when Father became enthralled with gaining more power within the Wizengamot. We are agreed; we have no interest in making England our home. We are planning to make our lives in Switzerland where we have spent the majority of our childhood." He paused. "I had determined that upon Father's death I would decline the seat in the Wizengamot and send it to the floor."

"Interesting," commented Lupin, "it's possible that magic knew of your intent and that coupled with your father's oath-breaking decided the fate of your family magic."

Narcissa nodded slowly. She thought Lupin was correct. Why would family magic designed to protect the wizarding population stay loyal to a family who clearly had no intent of following the original oath?

"As you have mentioned I am also part of the Durmstrang contingent at Hogwarts, and I have spent a lot of time with Theodore Nott recently in preparation of our Champions' next task." Christopher continued. "He and I share a number of political views. He speaks highly of the Houses of Potter and Black. I have observed for myself the power of the Head of the House of Potter in the execution of the first task. I will happily swear service on two conditions; one, that my mother is provided with a home and a living allowance which will provide her with the same lifestyle as she is accustomed to living with my father."

Alexandria stared at her son.

"And two?" prompted Lupin.

Christopher raised his chin. "Our education is protected and my sister is provided with a dowry for her future marriage."

Sirius regarded him thoughtfully for a long moment.

Narcissa found herself holding her breath wondering which way Sirius would decide. He could be so unpredictable…

Sirius leaned forward, clasping his hands on the table top and ignoring the cooling cup of tea beside him. "You will swear a lifetime of service to the House of Potter." He said sternly. "Your brother will be in service for a year following his education. Your sister will be considered to be under the protection of the House of Potter until such time as she marries. The House will provide an adequate dowry at that time. You'll all return to Durmstrang to finish your education. Your conditions regarding your mother will be met."

Christopher breathed out audibly. "Thank you, Lord Black."

Narcissa allowed an approving smile to curve her lips. Sirius had guaranteed the young man's loyalty and he would make a good, intelligent addition to the House of Potter.

"We'll take the oath before the end of the day." Sirius said crisply. "But for now, Remus will see about sorting out the practicalities of your money and housing. We'll leave you to it."

A moment later, there was a flurry of hurried goodbyes and Narcissa found herself once again outside the room, pulling on her gloves as she readied herself for the outside world.

Sirius hovered beside her, helping Andromeda into her cloak. "Well, that was fun."

"Sirius." Andromeda said chidingly, pulling on a brightly coloured scarf.

"Why did the bloody vulture have to surrender?" Sirius complained loudly, his voice verging perilously on a whine.

Narcissa exchanged a sisterly look of exasperation at Sirius's antics with Andromeda, which drew a snort of amusement from Dora. Narcissa took a moment to savour that they were reconciled and could have such a moment.

"At least Wenlock's service to the House of Potter will give you a valid excuse for the vulture answering to your call." Narcissa pointed out calmly. "Politically, this is well done. Wenlock serves the House of Potter and you hold the proxy. Its alliances are now all in disarray. The Minor Houses associated and allied with it will be scrambling."

"She's right." Andromeda said briskly when Sirius gave nothing but a disgruntled harrumph. She patted Sirius's arm. "Try not to sulk too much, Sirius." She kissed his cheek before turning to Narcissa.

Andromeda hugged her briefly, did the same to her daughter much to Dora's horror, and hurried out with a murmur about already being late for her next appointment.

"I'll escort you out, Cousin." Sirius offered, winking at Dora in goodbye.

Narcissa accepted his arm.

"How are you, Cissy?" Sirius asked.

"I'm well. Thank you, Cousin." She said. "I was going to thank you for the baby vault when I saw you this evening for the family meal."

"Just don't paint the nursery silver and green." Sirius sniffed with fake imperiousness, taking her back to the Summers at the Black estate and their childhood – when Sirius had been her favourite cousin, funny and witty and protective.

"How is the baby?" Sirius asked tentatively as they made it into the main hall and started to thread a path through the waiting customers to the outside.

Narcissa smiled at him softly, allowing her awe and love to spill over into her expression, knowing Sirius would never use it against her. "Regina is doing well."

Sirius's eyes softened. "Regina, huh? You settled on the name."

"I wanted to honour Regulus." Narcissa confirmed as they stepped out into the sunshine. "This seemed right."

"What does Lucius think?" Sirius asked, as he cast a warming charm at her, along with a number of privacy spells, and drew her to a halt on the bottom step.

It wasn't an idle question despite the casual nature of Sirius's demeanour.

"He is happy to abide my wish in this as he is in all things to do with this pregnancy." Narcissa replied, knowing that her cousin would understand the subtleties of what she wasn't saying as well as what she was. Lucius's only interest in the child she carried was in its ability to keep her biddable within their marriage. She was under no illusion about that. "He'll be pleased about today's news. The House of Malfoy is the obvious choice to act as an intermediary between the Wenlocks' allies and the House of Black."

He snorted but with a resigned tilt of his head. "It seems I might have a bit more politicking to do today than I anticipated. Cornelius will be thrilled."

Narcissa hummed an agreement. The Minister thrived on political machinations and he'd be over the moon with the turn of events. "What is the position on Diggory?"

"They found the evidence they needed of the imperius curse. They also think he's been under the influence of suggestion potions for a while." Sirius straightened, a sober expression on his face. "The Healers said possibly he'd been under them since before Hallowe'en. The Aurors found evidence his alcohol had been spiked."

"They took advantage of his weakness." Narcissa commented, her nose wrinkling with disgust for Diggory's lack of character and feeble mind.

"Appears so." Sirius concurred mildly. "His wife confessed to Amelia that Amos has had an ongoing problem with drink. He sobered up when Cedric was born." He shrugged. "It came back after he didn't get the seat and then with the pressures of the Committee review and Cedric competing against Harry…"

"Do they believe Wenlock was responsible for the potions?" asked Narcissa.

Sirius shook his head. "They've questioned Wenlock with veritaserum. He used an Unforgiveable but he didn't do the potioning." He scowled. "They think Crouch did that and Wenlock just took advantage once Crouch couldn't get back to the Ministry."

"I assume Diggory is at Saint Mungo's receiving treatment?" Narcissa enquired.

Sirius nodded. "They're trying to assess if he's been given a sleeper spell."

An old trick of hiding a compulsion deep in the mind that would be triggered upon a key word. It was an ingenious spell, one that was tricky to do but extremely effective.

"Cornelius has placed him on sick leave and put Dirk in charge of the Department for now." Sirius continued.

Narcissa inclined her head. She didn't approve of the majority of the new Creature laws but she had to admit the man who'd spearheaded the review was probably best placed to lead the Department until Diggory returned – if Diggory returned.

"The publicity in this morning's press was positive to us." Narcissa commented, changing the subject a touch. The publicity had not been kind to the Diggorys or the Wenlocks. The newspapers had gushed over Harry's performance at the Wizengamot and there had been more than one respectful note of admiration for Sirius.

Sirius sighed. "I'm just pleased the worst of it is over."

The furore surrounding Lupin and the werewolf sanctuary was yesterday's news.

"How long will Nymphadora continue to provide him with protection?" Narcissa asked, adjusting the hold on her purse.

"For as long as it takes." Sirius said with a glare which asked her why she was probing that particular angle.

Narcissa inclined her head. "Dora seemed very cool towards him today."

"You noticed that?" Sirius gave a huff. "Of course you noticed that. They're not exactly subtle, are they?" He made a dismissive gesture. "She asked and he turned her down again, *I think*, but they're both being remarkably close-mouthed about the details."

Dora's pursuit of the werewolf was something Narcissa couldn't understand. She could not see why her niece was so enthralled with him. Lupin wasn't unattractive but his lycanthropy was a severe disadvantage and her niece could do better. At least it seemed Lupin knew that.

"Well, I should take my leave and head back to Harry." Sirius sighed. "He's probably wearing the floor out wondering what's going on."

"Is Harry eager to resume his lessons?" Narcissa asked politely. Draco had spent much of the holidays consolidating his alliances with the younger Nott and Zabini. She was pleased.

"Eager to get back to some kind of normality after everything that's happened." Sirius said.

Narcissa nodded slowly. "I am pleased you are not dead, Cousin. You need to take better care. Our Heir needs you." It was a mild chastisement for Sirius putting himself at risk; for putting his son through the trial of thinking he was dead.

Sirius's grey eyes flashed with something akin to amusement but he gave her a brisk nod and kissed her hand. "See you later, Cissy."

Narcissa watched him go with well-hidden fondness. She smoothed a hand over her abdomen and the swell of her body. Sirius's return had granted her a gift she had never thought she would have and she was determined that she would do all she could to help him rebuild the House of Black.

She shivered, the warming charm dissipating with Sirius's departure and abruptly decided against shopping. She made her way to the Leaky Cauldron to floo home.

Kreacher popped in beside her as soon as she exited the floo. "Mistress Cissy's husband returns."

"Thank you, Kreacher." Narcissa watched as Kreacher disappeared taking her outerwear with him. She smoothed a hand over her hair made her way to Lucius's study.

Lucius frowned slightly at the sight of her, even as he discarded his correspondence and rose to greet her. "I thought you intended to spend the day shopping?"

"An unexpected Black family meeting was held at Gringotts because of the Wenlocks." Narcissa commented dryly. She brought him up to speed with efficient brevity. She saw his eyes light up at the revelation of the Wenlock proxy.

"My, my." Lucius said smoothly as he resumed his place behind his desk. "This does open up some possibilities, doesn't it?"

"Perhaps we should invite Benjamin and Norman for breakfast tomorrow?" Narcissa suggested.

"An excellent idea. I'll invite Stewart too." Lucius caught on immediately to her plan to brief and discuss the turn of affairs with their closest allies. He turned back to his correspondence. "See to the arrangements; I'll owl them now."

The order rankled but Narcissa kept her expression calm as she headed back toward her own study where she'd call for the house elves. She'd allow Lucius his small victories. She had what she wanted – her fingers brushed against her child.

Her future was secure.

o-O-o

Harry sat down next to Daphne as Moody directed and shot her a quick grin. She rolled her eyes at him in response but he knew that she had no real objection to him being placed with her as a partner. Harry's good humour died a little as he caught sight of his former girlfriend across the aisle shooting Draco an admonishing look as he sniffed imperiously and sat beside her.

The start of the new term and Hermione still hadn't agreed to resume their dating. Harry had tried flowers which she'd thanked him for but nothing more, and another sincere written apology which she'd accepted gracefully but hadn't made any further comment upon. She was perfectly friendly; happy to discuss their holiday homework and to help him prepare for the second task but…no dates; no holding hands; no kissing.

Harry poked morosely at his parchment with his quill. He was out of ideas on how to win her back – well, there was the one idea but both Ron and Neville had pointed out he'd likely be grounded for a month by his Aunt Minnie if he did it…

"Stop brooding, Potter, and focus on the assignment." Daphne hissed, her wand weaving a modified privacy ward around them to prevent others from copying their work.

"Sorry." Harry muttered, a tinge of heat on his cheeks. He turned his attention to the blackboard again.

With the New Year, Moody had moved on from recognising threats and situational awareness to actual defence. On the board were a list of ten threats and their assignments were to come up with one solid defence against each. It amused Harry to see that in usual Moody style, there were only two acknowledged Dark creatures on it. The rest were thought provoking including 'a friend' which made Harry think of Pettigrew, and 'a man/woman obsessed with you.' Harry wondered if his continuing pursuit of Hermione would be counted by her as a threat.

"Very well," Daphne said with an exasperated sigh, "out with it."

Harry turned to look at her confused.

"You're clearly not going to focus on our assignment until you've gotten the current state of affairs with Granger off your chest; so out with it." Daphne said impatiently, her eyes flashing with annoyance.

Harry didn't try to hide his wince. He sighed heavily and rubbed his cheek. "I just…I don't know how to convince her that I'm sorry about what happened."

Daphne folded her arms over her chest and tapped her fingers restlessly. "What has she said?"

"Said?"

Daphne rolled her eyes. "Yes, Potter; what has she *said* about forgiving you?"

"Um, not much?" Which was true. Harry quailed a little under the disbelieving stare of Daphne and pulled his thoughts together, remembering the first time he and Hermione had met after Sirius's return and his own. "She told me she understood that I thought I was protecting her but that she couldn't be with me again until I could demonstrate that I trusted her to make her own decisions about her security and protection."

"Those were her exact words?" checked Daphne, a considering expression drifting across her face that Harry knew meant she was thinking.

He nodded.

"Well, it's clear why the apologies haven't worked so far," she said crisply, "Granger's not going to believe you until you actually *show her* you trust her. Saying you're sorry isn't doing that."

"Oh." And suddenly Harry realised the fine line Daphne was pointing out for him; all of his apologies had been showing Hermione that he cared for her and still wanted to be with her, but they hadn't showed her that she was trusted. He frowned. How could he show her?

Daphne sighed as he said the final words out loud. "Well, you have two options."

Harry raised an eyebrow waiting for her to expand her statement.

"Either you contrive some kind of circumstance where Granger realises you trust her – "

Harry was already shaking his head. "Hermione will see right through that."

"Probably," Daphne conceded, "and she values honesty so you'd be in worse dragon dung with her than you already are."

"Thank you." Harry said dryly. He could always count on Daphne to tell him how it was in blunt no-nonsense terms.

Daphne shrugged, a small smile on her lips. "So you're stuck then because the only other way to regain her favour is to actually trust her and wait for a moment to demonstrate that to her."

Harry sighed again, unwilling to accept her words but knowing they were the truth. "I guess." He shook himself a touch as though that would shake away the melancholy of the realisation and picked up his quill again. "We should get on with this." He pursed his lips. "How do you deal with a drunk but well-meaning bystander?"

"Sobering charm?" Daphne suggested immediately.

And he was inordinately grateful to her for allowing him to change the subject. The rest of the Defence lesson flew by and before he knew it school was over for the day.

He fell into step with Daphne as they made their way to the Room of Requirement where they were due to meet up with the rest of the Potter alliance and his other friends for his second task preparations. Daphne remained quiet beside him as though she understood he needed the silence to consider what they had discussed.

The Room opened into its usual formation for the task discussions and Harry made his way to the dais where Draco, Neville and Hermione all joined him. Bill, who was ostensibly performing guard duty, entered at the end of the stream of Hogwarts students and closed the door behind him.

Harry's scar itched and he rubbed it before he cleared his throat noisily. The crowd in front of him settled down instantly. He smiled at them all; humbled and honoured at having so many people prepared to help him. "It's January now and the second task will happen in February so we only have a month and a bit to go now. I'd like us to regroup on where we are right from the start."

Hermione levitated the board with the clues to the front to remind everyone.

"*Water, water, everywhere; of your prized possession take great care; for prisoners rarely work together; and time will not last forever."*

"Right," Hermione said briskly, "let's begin from the top: location."

"There's activity around the Lake." Blaise answered promptly. "They're definitely preparing something."

"He's right." Natalie Warren asserted. "Robert and I have both been informed that the patrols are to keep students away from the Lake."

Bill nodded. "They've masked the whole area with an illusion that makes it appear that the Lake is undisturbed but it is."

"Is the illusion restricted to above or below the lake?" Theo asked calmly.

"Both." Bill cocked his head to the side. "Good point."

"So, we know it's the Lake, and we think that it's likely to be have both a below and above component." Hermione made a note, chewing her lips thoughtfully.

"The above component could be nothing more than a landing stage." Daphne pointed out.

"Or it could be integral to the task." Draco countered. "We don't know enough."

"So we find out." Neville responded. "What if we find a way to get around the illusion or break it?"

"I doubt any of us have the magical power to do that except for Harry." Hermione said before Draco could answer sneeringly.

"But Neville has the right idea." Blaise said, shooting the Gryffindor a quick grin. "We need to find out exactly what they're building."

"Bill, I'm guessing that you don't actually know what they're building?" Harry asked, leaning back against the table behind him.

"No. The security here have been told that they're building but not what." Bill said regretfully.

"Who exactly is building?" asked Daphne shrewdly.

"And can they be bought or bribed into giving the information over?" Theo nodded. "It would be a good plan."

"It's a Gringotts' team so I doubt it's feasible." Bill said thoughtfully. "But I do know that the illusion allows animals and mer-people to see through it without incident."

"A spy." Ron proclaimed, pointing a figure at his brother. "We can get Remus to talk one of the mer-people into spying for us!"

"I doubt the mer-people are going to be open to telling us what's going on." Draco drawled.

"He's right." Hermione sent Ron a quick look of apology for siding with Draco. "We have no idea if Remus would agree and even if he does, convincing someone in the mer-people to do it and then relying on them…"

"Fine," Ron threw up his hands, "it was a bad idea!"

"Not a wholly bad idea, Ron." Harry comforted his first friend with a grin. "A spy is a good idea, and we can try. If it doesn't work, we just have to think of some other means except Remus convincing a mer-person."

Ron seemed mollified by that.

Hermione took advantage of the silence and jumped in. "Right, we'll need to ask Remus and if that's not a go, we'll think of something else."

Harry nodded gratefully at her. "Thank you."

She blushed prettily and tapped the blackboard. "In the meantime, we have a list of spells to learn for above the water and below it. We need to step up practicing these." She tapped the blackboard again and it changed to the next topic. "Have we made any progress on what will be taken?"

Theo shifted. "In one of the study sessions, I found a draft letter from a student to a parent saying that Karkaroff apparently has told Krum's lot about the details of the original task before it was altered."

Harry inwardly flinched at the reminder that Voldemort had altered the tasks to make them more dangerous. He absently touched his scar.

"And?" prompted Ron impatiently.

Theo altered his stance. "The original task chose the person in closest proximity to the Champion at the moment that the Champion signed their name on the parchment that they used to enter into the tournament on the assumption they would be the most important person to the Champion. Krum apparently believes his original hostage might have been someone random in the library at the time he signed his name as that's where he was."

"Cedric's original hostage would have been Cho then." Susan broke in. "She was sitting right next to him when he signed the parchment before he went and entered his name."

"You must have been observing him closely to determine that." Blaise teased.

Susan shot him a dirty look but her cheeks had gone bright red.

"Well, that doesn't really tell us which of us would have ended up as Harry's hostage, does it?" Ron muttered. "He didn't enter himself! Who knows when he signed that parchment?!"

"Well, it's probably something I signed officially." Harry murmured. "It's pretty likely either Sirius or Remus would be the hostage." It made his heart ache to think of Sirius being used as a hostage against him after the events at Christmas.

"But we know it's unlikely that Voldemort continued with the same plan." Hermione said briskly. "He may have taken the principle of hostages but turned it into something completely different."

"And we know that Crouch at least knew using the person closest to the Champion when he'd signed the parchment wasn't going to accurately target Harry's hostage enough for whatever they have planned." Daphne added.

"That's it!" Ron proclaimed passionately. "We've got to think about this like Crouch! Who would he want to put in danger?" He started to pace. "I mean, he's a Death Eater so he hates muggleborns and goes with the pureblood crap, and he hates Harry and Sirius that's a given, so…"

"Me." Hermione's chin lifted a touch.

Harry's heart dropped to his feet. No! Hermione couldn't be in danger! She couldn't! "You weren't my girlfriend at the time he gave the parameters to the cup though." He pointed out.

"But she is a likely candidate." Theo noted dispassionately. "She was announced as a Daughter of the House of Black, she's a muggleborn, one of your closest friends, and clearly someone who Lord Black favours. Crouch might have figured that was enough."

Hermione had paled and Harry wanted to reach out and catch hold of her hand to reassure them both that everything was going to be alright; that he wouldn't let her be harmed. The urge to send her away somewhere safe rose through him again but he wrestled it back. Sending her to a different country wouldn't help. The magic of the Goblet would simply return her to the competition and besides…it had been made clear to him that Harry had to trust Hermione could decide for herself.

"I guess I should practice all these spells with you." Hermione commented bravely, her brown eyes meeting his challengingly even though a flicker of fear was still there lurking in their depths.

"You'd do that anyway." Ron said oblivious to the undercurrent between his friends.

Harry nudged his glasses up and tried a smile. "You'll probably get them before me."

"Weasley should practice too." Draco commented.

Ron spun round and glared at the Slytherin. "What?"

Draco scowled at him. "Given the timing of when Crouch had to have put the parameters to choose in the Goblet, you are the other likely candidate, are you not? A blood traitor to the Dark Lord's cause, Potter's best friend, responsible for ensuring Lord Black was exonerated and also favoured by him given the alliance of friendship with your family and Potter?"

Ron went white under his freckles. "Blimey!"

"Malfoy's right, Ron." Bill said. "You are the other most likely candidate."

"I would think the other candidate is Lord Black." Theo said. "Crouch could have included him."

"I think it's unlikely that he would put Sirius into the task." Ron said, making a clear effort to move past the news that he was one of the most likely candidates to be taken as Harry's hostage. "He wouldn't want to risk putting someone who knew what they were doing in there."

"That makes sense." Harry agreed, relief seeping through him with the thought that Sirius wouldn't be targeted.

"Me and Hermione." Ron said bravely. "We're the most likely candidates."

And that worried Harry but in some ways it seemed right. It had always been the three of them getting into trouble and getting out of trouble. His gaze slipped to Hermione who stared back at him challengingly.

"So, we plan on that basis." Harry said abruptly, holding Hermione's gaze. "And you guys practice." He let his tone soften. "Wouldn't be the first time we had an adventure, would it?"

Hermione gave a sharp nod and breathed in deeply. "At least we have time to plan."

Ron grinned at him. "Let's just hope there's no spiders."

The whole room seemed to relax as Harry smiled reluctantly back at his best friends.

"What about the rest of the Champions?" Hermione asked suddenly. "I mean, if Crouch is targeting either me or Ron he's bound to have targeted the hostages for the other Champions with the same criteria."

"Which is likely to be best friend, or something to do with the sponsorship or alliances." Theo agreed.

It went unsaid that he'd find some way to inform the others but everyone nodded, understanding that Theo was couching his words given the clear instruction for Harry not to confer with his fellow Champions.

"Are we definitely saying that the prized possession then will not be an item of importance?" Blaise asked.

"It's unlikely." Harry said simply. "Voldemort changed the first task just enough to increase the danger but Professor Dumbledore confirmed that the original first task was to retrieve a golden egg from a dragon's nest."

"So going on that basis, the second task was going to be retrieving someone from the Lake, it's likely that he won't have strayed too far from that just ramped up the danger quotient." Blaise nodded far too cheerfully. "Got you."

"Right," Harry said, "I think we've exhausted talking about the task unless anyone else has anything?"

Nobody spoke up.

Harry raised his wand. "Defence practice then. Everyone split into pairs, we're playing dodge-spell!"

It always surprised him how quickly everyone moved. Within moments, they were all practising in small duelling domes that Harry had the Room construct. He and Bill walked around the various pairs providing instruction and guidance. The rules of the game were pretty simple: one person practiced hitting the other with a spell and the other person dodged. Once they'd been hit three times they swapped or when Harry whistled to signal a change in role.

There had been some muttering about using a game for instruction when they'd first started but as everyone had seen how effective it was at improving their aim and their ability to avoid being hit with spells, they'd all started to really enjoy it.

Harry helped Connor Sapworthy adjust his aim against his friend before wandering over to where Hermione and Luna were practicing. Both girls were quick and fierce.

Maybe Hermione was right. Maybe she could take care of herself. Or at least, maybe Harry should trust her to take care of herself more than he had been doing before.

Bill tapped Harry on the shoulder. "You alright there, Harry?"

Before he could reply, a chime sounded in the room. Instantly everyone stopped and more than a few groans punctuated the silence.

"Session's over!" Harry called out briskly. "You'll need to get moving for dinner."

There was an immediate steady trickle of students heading to the door. Draco nodded imperiously at Harry before leaving with Theo and Blaise. Hermione smiled at Harry briefly but didn't speak to him as she fell into step with Ron and Ginny.

Harry watched her leaving with a heavy heart. It wasn't too long before he and Bill were the only ones left inside the room. Harry swished his wand absently and the room melted away into a facsimile of Harry's room at Griffin House.

"Wow." Bill said impressed. "The room really can be anything you want it to be, huh? I'm guessing you're feeling a little homesick?"

"Things were simpler in the Summer." Harry grumbled. He threw himself down on his bed, sitting on the edge feeling very morose. He wasn't surprised when Bill pulled up the spare chair to sit in front of him.

"You want to talk about it?" offered Bill.

For a long moment, Harry wanted to brush off the oldest Weasley brother's concern, pretend everything was fine and wallow in his own misery. But the comfort of the familiar room, of a room that was truly his for the first time in his life, took him back to all the chats he and Bill had had in the Summer, and within moments the whole mess tumbled out including his conversation with Daphne.

Bill listened carefully without asking questions until eventually Harry fell silent a little mortified that he'd unburdened himself so much to the eldest Weasley. Bill simply reached over and patted Harry's shoulder comfortingly.

"Girl trouble, huh." Bill gave an exaggerated wince. "If it helps every guy goes through it."

A faint look of empathy flittered in and out of his blue eyes but it was enough to ease Harry's discomfort and tell him that maybe Bill had something of his own to brood about.

"Uh, are you and Alicia OK?" asked Harry tentatively.

Bill's gaze sharpened and Harry almost squirmed under the hard look he was subjected to before Bill sighed heavily.

"Coming to the end of the road, I reckon." Bill admitted with a grimace.

"If you want to talk about it…" Harry offered uncertainly.

Bill smiled. "That's a good offer but I'll pass. I'm sure you don't want me to bore you with the details of my love life."

"I bored you with the details of mine." Harry pointed out wryly. "I mean, you listened to me."

Bill laughed and rubbed the back of his neck. "Well, since you put it that way…" he shrugged. "It's not really a big deal. You know my Mum is really keen on me and Alicia settling down?"

Harry nodded, thrilled that Bill was going to allow him to return the favour and be a listening board. He felt for Bill; Molly wasn't exactly subtle with her attempts to get Bill to consider marrying Alicia.

"Well, neither of us is ready for that." Bill stated without prevarication. "So when Alicia and I first talked about how Mum was, I promised to ask Mum to tone it down, which I did, and she promised she would, and it was fine for a while." Bill explained. "But you know my Mum."

Harry winced because he did. Ron's stubbornness had to come from somewhere.

"So it's awkward at times and…I guess both of us are wondering if seeing each other still is worth the hassle." Bill shrugged, surprisingly calm about the impending break-up of his relationship. "I'm predicting that I'm going to get the 'it's not you it's me' speech any day now from Alicia."

"Are relationships always this difficult?" Harry asked a touch grumpily. Remus and Tonks seemed at odds too lately with Tonks being very cold to Remus. Sirius had warned him to keep out of it, saying whatever argument the pair had had, they had to work it out themselves.

"They're always hard work." Bill confirmed. He tilted his head. "The first thing you've got to ask yourself is this: is what you and Hermione have worth the effort of fixing things with her?"

"Yes." Harry didn't even have to think about it. He really liked Hermione and he still wanted to be with her. He was prepared to do anything to make it right between them again.

"Do you understand what Hermione's problem with you is enough to fix it?" pressed Bill.

"I think so. Hermione's annoyed with me because I made a decision to push her away without talking with her first." He bit his lip. "Not so much the thing with sending her and the others back to Hogwarts because I was, uh, really upset and she understood that but, you know, after. Thinking staying away from everyone would protect them better, and telling her again we were over because I wanted to protect her." His cheeks heated again at the memory of what he'd done. He'd been so stupid…

"You were upset and grieving and your ability to make rational decisions was compromised." Bill said comfortingly. "Everyone understands that, including Hermione."

"But she hasn't forgiven me like everyone else has." Harry replied miserable.

Bill nudged him. "Why do you think that is?"

Harry sighed heavily again. "I really hurt her."

"And what do you think will fix that?"

"I think Daphne's right." Harry said. "Hermione knows I'm sorry but she's not going to think about getting back together until I've *shown* her that I trust her." He rubbed his head again. "She's not going to trust me not to do what I did again until she feels I trust her I guess."

"I think that's a good guess." Bill patted his shoulder again.

"So I'm stuck waiting until I somehow prove to Hermione that I trust her." Harry mumbled unhappily, and he'd known that before they'd started talking in truth – he'd just been hoping for a different answer.

Bill nudged him again. "Based on tonight's discussion about the task, I think you're going to get your opportunity sooner rather than later."

"He's going to target her isn't he?" Harry sighed and flopped back on the bed. "I just…I don't want anyone hurt because of me. Is that so much to ask?"

"It's not your fault, Harry." Bill said firmly. "Who knows what insanity is going through Crouch and You-Know-Who's head?" He tapped Harry's knee and waited until Harry got upright again before continuing. "Nobody disagreed with you sending your friends out of danger and I get why you did what you did at Christmas. But I know you know that it wasn't the best way to handle things. You remember that first meeting with the alliance kids? You told them you were stronger if you all stuck together and you were right."

"I know." Harry said, plucking at the coverlet on the bed absently. "I just…it feels like everyone gets hurt because of me and that sucks."

"You have to keep in mind that it's not because of you; it's because of Crouch and You-Know-Who." Bill reiterated. "Nobody blames you."

Harry nodded slowly. It wasn't as though he hadn't had the same conversation with Sirius, Remus and Dumbledore and…pretty much everyone. Maybe he should start believing it. His parents had told him the same thing hadn't they? His heart ached at the memory of seeing them in the cemetery but underneath the pain was the solace that they loved him; loved each other; that they believed in him.

"So I make sure Hermione – and Ron – both practice like mad and can take care of themselves." Harry said out loud.

Bill nodded.

Harry grimaced and absently rubbed at his scar again. He was going to have to wait for Hermione to fully forgive him that was clear. It was a disappointing conclusion but he guessed one he had to live with since he was serious about her. He looked back up at Bill.

"What about you and Alicia?" He asked curiously. "I guess you're not planning to fix things?"

The oldest Weasley shook his head. "As quick as you were to say you and Hermione was worth fighting for, I'd say the opposite about me and Alicia." He shrugged, an amused glint in his eye. "We're good together and we've had fun, and Merlin knows, I will always be grateful for her helping to heal me after the duel with Crouch…but I don't think we're meant to be together forever otherwise neither of us would be resisting my Mum so much." He shrugged again. "So I'll let her break up with me and I'll find someone else." He poked Harry in the knee. "You may want to consider that you're young yet too. Hermione might seem like the be-all and end-all of everything right now but there are other girls out there."

Harry shook his head. He *liked* Hermione. Besides, if he did go out with someone else during whatever this was – a break, a pause, a test? – then Hermione could go out with other blokes and he definitely didn't like the idea of that.

Bill smiled, amused indulgence all over his face before it melted away to concern. "Do you have a headache?"

Harry froze and frowned at him. "No. Why?"

"You keep rubbing your scar." Bill waved at his forehead.

Harry realised his hand had drifted up again. He yanked his hand down. "It just…it always kind of itches in here."

Bill's expression sobered immediately. "Really?"

Harry nodded.

"You know curse scars usually react in the presence of Dark magic?" Bill commented as he got to his feet, his wand already in his hand as he scanned the room suspiciously.

"Or the presence of the one who…" Harry blanched and leaped up, his wand falling into his hand. He took a breath and calmed himself. It was very unlikely Voldemort was hiding out in the Room of Requirement. But if not Voldemort…

"The horcrux!" Harry blurted out. "He hid the horxcrux here!"

"Bloody smart wanker, isn't he?" grumbled Bill, twirling his wand. "How do we know what kind of room he stored it in?"

Harry frowned. "Well, maybe if we both try exiting the room and thinking of somewhere to hide something?"

Bill nodded thoughtfully. "Might work."

They made their way into the corridor.

Bill looked back at the blank wall. "You want to give it a go?"

Harry considered all the possible options and shook himself. He was making it too complicated. He paced in front of the wall…

*I want somewhere to hide something important…I want somewhere to hide something important…I want somewhere to hide something important…*

The door appeared.

Bill waved Harry back and Harry bit down on his want to protest knowing Sirius would give him grief for not allowing the fully trained curse-breaker to go first. Bill opened the door and entered.

"You can come in."

Harry stepped inside eagerly and stopped abruptly beside a similarly shocked Bill. He took in the towering piles of books and trunks and broomsticks and…everything and anything! There were rows upon rows upon rows! Piles upon piles upon…

"Accio Ravenclaw's diadem!" Bill called out, weaving his wand through the spell movements almost unconsciously.

Nothing happened.

"Bugger." Bill swore roundly before grinning sheepishly at Harry. "It was never going to be that easy, was it?"

Harry shook his head and looked back at the seemingly endless room.

It wasn't going to be easy.

It was going to take a while and be hard work but he thought with furious satisfaction, they were closer to finding the elusive horcrux than they had been before, and he would only ever consider that a win.
