**(** **Midnight: Kamino Ward: Unknown Apartment Building** **)**

"Hm. Pass."

*"Really?"* The television spoke, *"He's incredibly formidable. Why not involve him?"*

Tomura shook his head, reading over the name Muscular. “Look at his track record. He’s more than a wildcard. All he cares about is killing. This isn’t about joining a group or following ideals for him; it’s just an opportunity for him to find new people to kill.”

*“A weapon we can point.”*

“No. We can’t control him, not for long. It won’t be long until he decides being *told* who to kill and *when* to kill isn’t for him."

*“If he’s as much of a wildcard as you say he is, then how badly do you think he’ll react when you reject him?”*

“...He’ll probably try to kill me,” Tomura groaned.

*“And do you think you could kill him?”*

“If I got my hands on him.”

*“Which I have no doubt that you would. But, how long would it take for your quirk to decay a man of that size, especially with his quirk encompassing him in muscle strands? Even if you did kill him, would you come out unscathed?”*

  Tomura sighed, removing the hand from his face to pinch the bridge of his nose, “Not even close.”

*“So, what can you do?”*

“...Keep him reigned in, then let him loose when the time comes. Portal him in at the edge of the facility, like the cliff sides or something. He’ll get easily distracted by his own bloodlust, which will be a perfect distraction for anyone he comes across. Ideally, we’ll have done everything we needed and be gone before he ever even notices. Eraserhead will block his quirk, and he’ll be taken down no problem, out of our hair for good.”

*“Hmhmhm. Well done, Young Tomura. Anyone else?”*

“...Mm. Not for now.”

*“I can tell something else is on your mind. Is there somebody else you've been thinking of?"*

Tomura shut his laptop, shaking his head. "Nobody realistic."

*"I'm all ears."*

Tomura sighed, preparing to immediately be laughed at. "...What about the Midoriya kid?"

*"Hahaha!"*

"There it is."

*"Oh, Young Tomura, while I appreciate the ambition, you and I both know that would never work."*

“We both saw him go nuts on the Bakugou kid. He beat the shit out of him, and he wanted it, too. Badly.”

*“Hm, yes. But, trust me, Young Tomura. The boy will never turn. Don’t forget, he was also the only one who ran into the USJ to aid All Might after he defeated the Nomu. He also began to cry at the Festival award ceremony, purely from All Might’s words. He’s in far too deep. The hero world, All Might especially, has him in their clutches. He was chosen for a reason."*

Tomura hummed in response, thinking back to both moments from the Sports Festival. He disagreed on that point, about the crying. But, there would be no convincing his master. "Maybe so, but…interesting, all the same."

*“Perhaps, but he is not our focus for the time being. He’s merely a boy grasping at a power he’ll never be able to control.”*

Tomura raised a brow, “Really? He’s got tricks up his sleeve that All Might doesn’t have.”

*“Flashy tricks won’t matter,”* All For One replied, dismissively. *“Sparks and light shows won’t compare to our power.”*

*‘...You’re too overconfident.’* Tomura thought, but kept his mouth shut. 

*"And how are the new recruits settling in?"*

"Fine, I guess. You could have told me you knew one of them."

*"Hm, I must admit, I did not say anything because I never expected to see Young Touya ever again. I figured that was a lost cause.”*

Tomura turned towards the TV, a brow raised, “You *never* let anything be a lost cause. Not when it’s useful.”

*“A boy who creates fire, who isn’t immune to fire, is not much use. Especially one so unstable, at least at the time.”*

“And you think he’s stable now?”

*“Hmhmhm, I never said that. But, at the time, I was looking for certain…precautionary measures, so to speak.”*

Tomura rolled his eyes, “So he was a back-up plan for me. Got it. And how many of those do you have?”

*“Unfortunately none. You’d be surprised how hard suitable candidates are to find.”*

Tomura scoffed, standing up from his desk, “If I’m the best and only candidate you could find in the past sixteen years, we might be fucked.”

*“Have faith in yourself, Young Tomura.”*

“Better myself than these recruits.”

*“Hm, and speaking of them, two more have arrived in the bar. Go make yourself acquainted.”*

Tomura sighed as he placed his hand on his face, moving towards his bedroom door. “Well, it can’t get any weirder than the first two.” 

  
  
  
  

***…~AIV~...***

  
  
  
  

*‘Ooooooh no.’*

Tomura had opened the door to the bar, and his brows rose as he saw a formally dressed, masked man flamboyantly posing, and a lizard man dressed exactly like Stain. 

“Greetings and salutations!” the masked gentleman introduced himself, taking a bow before Tomura. “I am the grand thief, the final curtain to a corrupt world, the aristocrat of criminals…Mr. Compress!”

“I have literally never heard of you.”

“Wh-...W-Well, of course you haven’t! The perfect thief is the one that is known by no one, and has never left a trace.”

“Mhm, of course. And you…” Tomura pointed at the Stain-Wannabe, completely silent as he looked the criminal up and down, and deadpanned at the massive bundle of blades next to him. “...there’s not enough time in the day.”

“I agree,” the reptile-man said. “That time should be spent killing fake heroes.”

*‘...Wow, okay.’* Tomura nodded, “Of course. If I let you in, that is. And your name?”

“I go by Spinner.”

“Hm, alright then. Let’s start with Ebenezer over here. A thief that follows the ideals of Stain? A Robin Hood then.”

“An astute observation,” Compress hummed in approval. “However, my inspiration is the Peerless Thief.”

Tomura nodded, sitting down at the bar and leaning back against the counter, “Ah, now he I’ve heard of. Big shoes to fill, though. If you wanna compare to him, then you have to be able to bring a lot to the table.”

“Undeniably.” Compress leaned one elbow on the bar, readying to get down to business. He turned to Kurogiri, “Please, your finest chardonnay, my good man.”

Kurogiri looked up from the glass he was polishing, giving a dead stare to Compress. Kurogiri reached under the counter and placed a can of beer in front of him, going back to his business as Tomura chuckled.

“...Right. Anyway, my abilities,” Compress continued. “Aside from my admittedly stunning intellect, I have the ability to compress and trap anything I touch into tiny marbles. No damage done, and they are completely at my will.

Tomura hummed, his interest grabbed, “Really? Anything?”

Compress pulled another marble out of pocket, laying it down on the counter and activating his quirk. The marble morphed into a small, chittering little izu robin. Compress let the bird hop onto his finger, petting the top of its head with his finger. 

“Anything.”

“That’s…actually incredibly useful.”

“Hmhm! Shall I assume the shoes have been filled?”

“I guess we’ll see. You’re in. We’ll discuss finer details later, but whatever personal demands you may have will be taken into consideration.”

“Wonderful!” Compress stamped his cane on the floor, extending a hand out, “A true gentleman thief shakes hands to complete a deal.”

Tomura scoffed, shaking his head, “Trust me, you don’t want to shake my hand.”

Compress looked up and down at the gray hands covering Tomura’s body, and retracted his own. “Eh, well, I’ll take your word for it...You allow pets, right?”

Tomura shrugged, “As long as you’re responsible for him. Apartment building is connected through the back door.”

“Of course. Come, Perrugia.” Compress picked his robin up again, walking towards the back door. “Let’s find a room with a good view.”

Perrugia chirped in response as they disappeared through the back. Tomura leaned forward in his stool, turning towards the other possible recruit.

“Okay, Gex. Tough act to follow, I know, but that doesn’t matter. Just tell me your deal.”

“I am known as Spinner.” The lizard stood hunched, just like Stain, a steely gaze in his eyes. “I’m here to aid your effort in spreading the word of the Hero Killer.”

*‘Oh boy,’* Tomura immediately thought. He figured as much, but it was still worrying. Taking in a bunch of people who followed a man who hated you was far from advisable. “Naturally…”

“As you can see, I have the attributes of a gecko.”

Tomura pocketed his hands, clicking his tongue, “...Uh-huh. And that entails?”

“Oh, uh…I can stick to walls.”

“...And?”

Spinner shifted his eyes before shrugging, “That’s it.”

“Yeah, okay. Um…” Tomura did his absolute best to hold back a sigh, scrambling for literally anything else. “Can you regrow your limbs?”

“I-...I have no idea, and I really don’t want to find out.”

“Fair enough…Fuck it, you’re in.”

“Yes!” Spinner pumped his fist as he smiled brightly. He froze, quickly composing himself back into a serious demeanor. “Oh! I mean…A wise decision.”

*‘Ah, okay. A follower, but more of a fanboy. I guess I can work with that…hopefully.’* Spinner was sent to the connected building with the rest of the members, leaving Tomura alone with Kurogiri. Tomura took his hand off of his face, turning around to rest his head in his arms on the bar. “I already miss when there were only four of us psychopaths.”

*“I must admit, Young Tomura…”* The television suddenly buzzed to life, the static appearing on the screen. *“I did not expect you to accept him. His powers are not the most useful.”*

Tomura shook his head, not looking up, “Turning down the biggest Stain fan wouldn’t exactly look good for us.”

*“Hm. A fair point. Let us just hope he proves himself useful in action.”* 

Kurogiri placed a glass of ice water in front of Tomura, opening a portal to his room. “The next recruit won’t be here until after dawn. Go get some rest.”

“Right…” Tomura took the water, grumbling as he got up and walked towards the portal. ”…rest.”

**(** **A Few Hours Later: Jirou Household: Kyouka’s Room** **)**

  
  

*~“C'mon, Toshi! Kick your ass into gear!"~*

*~“Kotaro, I want you to meet someone. I've got myself an apprentice! This is Toshinori Yagi."~*

*~“I love ya, kid. You know that, right?"~*

*~“I can’t tell you. You can’t be involved. I’m so sorry.”*

Izuku bolted awake, a hand immediately pressing against his chest and pushing him back down into bed. 

Kyouka nuzzled into the crook of his neck, sighing against his skin. "Nightmare?"

Izuku cranes his neck over to look at the window. Even with the shut blinds, he could tell the sun wasn't even close to being up.

"No," he sighed. "More memories."

Kyouka groaned, turning around so that her back was to Izuku. "What's One For All even waiting for? Why won't they just talk to you?"

"Your guess is as good as mine," Izuku scoffed, wrapping his arms around Kyouka and enveloping her in his warmth. "A golden opportunity, I suppose?"

"If it's important, any time before something bad happens is a golden opportunity."

"You make a fantastic point. A point I don't think they understand." Izuku kissed the nape of her neck, shutting his eyes to try and go back to sleep. “I know it’s Nana, but I just don't know why she’s not talking. There is a new voice, though. I don’t recognize her, but I think I’ve heard her name in some of the memories.”

“What is it?”

“Kaina, I think. I don’t know the name, and All Might’s never said it before.”

Kyouka rubbed Izuku’s arms, his body heat spreading across her back, “You could ask him.”

“Ah, he doesn’t like to talk about his past much. I don’t want to make him uncomfortable.”

“And who does that sound like?”

Izuku grumbled against her skin, “Very funny. If I don’t get any answers by the end of the summer, I’ll ask him. I’d rather not think about it while we’re supposed to be on vacation.” 

"You can't even escape somebody else's past."

“I signed up to be a part of eight other pasts, not even including my own, and they’re all gonna catch up to me.”

Kyouka sighed, leaning her head back against his chest, “I don’t think anyone’s past was ever really left behind.”

  
  
  

***…~AIV~...***

  
  

**(** **A Few Hours Later: Unknown Apartment Building** **)**

  
  

*~"Tenko? Tenko?! Tenko, stop! No-!!!"~*

*~"What have I told you?! Never go in there! Never speak of her!"~*

*~"Mom! Mom, help me! Please, Tenko! Don-UAAAH-!!!"~*

Tomura didn't bolt awake. His eyes opened slowly, far too used to the memories flooding his nightmares. 

He took the bubbling rage in his stomach that always appeared after his nightmares and pushed it down, storing it away for later.

All For One had taught him that rage was useless without a proper time and target. 

Tomura breathed in deep, trying to drown out the lingering screams in the back of his mind.

All he needed was a little peace and quiet.

*“Get back here, you bitch!”*

Tomura’s head drooped, the stomping and screaming in the halls outside growing louder. “Uuuuugh…”

Maybe if he just ignored them, they would go away.

*"I don't care if I burn this place to the ground as long as you're in it."*

…God-damn it.

Tomura hopped out of bed, grumbling all the way across his room. He opened his door, stepping out into the hall.

“What the hell’s going o-...” Tomura froze, his eyes wide like saucers as he gazed at two Dabi’s standing in the hallway. “...Well, clearly I’m still asleep, because two of you is a nightmare.”

The Dabi on the right raised his arm out, a bloody bite mark evident on his forearm. “That little brat bit me and turned into… *that!”*

“Referring to yourself with such a disgustful tone?” The Dabi on the left asked, a wide smile and a crazed look in his(?) eye. “Says a lot about you, huh?”

"Go fuck yourself."

"...So, fuck you?"

Ignoring Dabi growling in response, Tomura looked down at the left Dabi’s hand, seeing a tan cardigan in their grasp. “...Toga?” 

The left Dabi smiled wide and saluted, red-tinted fangs on full display. "Reporting for duty!"

Tomura had to stop himself from laughing at the sight of the ever dreary Dabi in such a pose. “So, that’s what you meant by ‘becoming Stain,’ huh? I guess we never got around to asking what your quirk was. So, blood consumption?”

“Yep! Just a little blood and a whole new me!”

Dabi scoffed, “Yeah, *whole new* ? Still seems like a crazy bitch to me.”

“It depends on how much blood, though,” Toga continued, ignoring Dabi’s insults. “I didn’t get much, so I should be turning back right about…” Both men watched as the clone Dabi suddenly began to melt like ice cream in the sun. From hair, skin, to even the clothes, all began to fall to the floor. “You might wanna look away.”

“Oh, what the-?!” / “The hell-?!” Both men quickly averted their eyes as Toga shook off the last of the goop, now completely naked.

“Sorry!” Toga laughed out, picking up her cardigan and holding it over herself. “This just happens after I transform!”

The door at the end of the hall suddenly opened up, revealing Compress without his hat and overcoat. “What is going on out here? Peruggia is trying to slee-...”

He stopped at the sight of Toga, immediately turning around, walking back into his room, and shutting the door. 

Tomura chuckled, turning back to Toga, who had put on her (thankfully) oversized cardigan. “Toga, do your best not to bite any more League members. But, if you do, they’re allowed to attack back.”

“Deal! Ok, byeee!~” She rushed down the hall, returning to her room.

Tomura looked over to Dabi, nodding towards Toga’s direction. “Kurogiri can make sure you get patched up. If you let this go now, if she bites you again you’re allowed to turn her into charcoal. Deal?”

Dabi sighed, pocketing his hands as he walked away. “Whatever. But, at this point, all we can hope for is that we don’t embarrass ourselves.”

Tomura chuckled, moving back towards his room. “Unfortunately, that’s looking like a guarantee. Let’s just hope the heroes embarrass themselves first.”

  
  
  

***…~AIV~...***

  
  
  

**(** **A Few Hours Later: Outside of Local Convenience Store** **)**

  
  

This would be the most embarrassing thing Izuku had ever done in his life.

*'Just pull the band-aid off, Kyouka said. It’ll be fine, Kyouka said. It’s only embarrassing if you make it, Kyouka said. And yet she still refused to come along. Ugh, okay, you can do this, Izuku. You. Can. Do. This.'* Taking a deep breath, Izuku grabbed the door handle...and immediately backed away. "Urgh! I can't! I can't! What if I get the wrong size? What if it's a bad brand? What if the cashier knows my mom? Why didn't out of everything I do research on, this isn't one of them?!"

"Kid." Izuku jumped, turning towards the convenience store door to see the clerk glaring at him. "You've been standing outside for thirty minutes. Either buy something or leave."

"O-Oh, sorry! I-I was just, uh...well I-"

"Young Midoriya?" Both Izuku and the clerk turned to see Toshinori pulling up to the curb in his truck, stepping out with a raised brow. "You shop here, too?"

*‘Oooooooh no. Nonononono.'* Izuku quickly began backing up, a nervous sweat running down his face. "What? Here? Nope! Not at all! Why are you asking person I've never met before?!"

Toshinori deadpanned, turning back to the store clerk. 

"He's with me. We'll be out of your hair soon." The clerk rolled his eyes, walking back into the store. Izuku swiftly turned around, trying to casually make his escape. "Stop." Izuku seethed, his attempt to flee failing. "Get back here."

Sighing, Izuku turned around and walked back to All Might. "Look, I-I'm sorry for acting like that. I just...I'm here for a private matter, okay? How was I supposed to know you shopped at a normal corner store? I mean, aren't you rich?"

"Okay, one: my lifestyle, wealth, and how I go about it are not to be judged. Two: A private matter? Seriously?"

Izuku averted his eyes, hoping Toshinori didn't push further on the topic. "Y-Yeah."

Toshinori furrowed his brow in confusion, "What kind of 'private matter' would you have to deal with at a damn convenience store? I mean it's…" Toshinori's eyes widened, the answer dawning on him, and his idea being confirmed by the heavy blush growing on Izuku's face. "Oh...Oooh...Oh! Ohohohoho! Hahahahaha!"

"S-Stop laughing!"

"Hahahahahahahaha!"

"It's not funny!"

Toshinori leaned against the wall, clutching his abdomen as he continued to laugh. "Hahahaha! Young Midoriya, you sly dog!"

Covering his face with his hands, Izuku backed up into Toshinori's truck, sliding down to the ground. "Can I die now?"

Toshinori's laughter finally subsided as he walked over to Izuku, reaching down to ruffle his hair. "Well, that's certainly made my day. Now that I've… *mostly* used up all the amusement I get out of this, hehe, this is the part where I help you. Because, by the looks of it, you clearly don't know what you're doing."

Izuku looked up, his eyes wide. "You want to help me? With this? You already said you don't have much experience with women."

"I've fought villains like the world has never seen time and time again. I'm sure I can help you buy condoms.”

*“Please* don’t say it out loud! Never again!”

“Haha! I make no promises. Now, c'mon." He reached his hand down, Izuku hesitantly taking it and being pulled to his feet. "Besides, I said I don't have much experience ‘ *dating’* women."

"Oh...Ew."

"Wha-?! Ew?! So when it's about me, then it's gross?!" 

"To me? Kinda, yeah."

Toshinori groaned, "Whatever. C'mon, let's go." They walked into the store, heading towards the back and finding the right aisle. "Alright, with all that out of the way, I'm assuming you don't want me to give you the talk?" Toshinori asked, his voice low.

"Yes, I would very much like to avoid that conversation."

"Well, too bad. I have to be the responsible adult sometimes." Ignoring Izuku's groan, All Might continued. "So, have you and Young Jirou talked about this? Taking this step, I mean."

"A-Ah, kinda," Izuku hesitantly answered. He knew there was no way out of the conversation, and he was mature enough to know it was one he probably should have. "We've just been getting...ya know...c-closer. We've mentioned it before, but we're just not sure when it'll really happen. We just think that it's soon. This is just a precautionary purchase. We're just...nervous. Neither of us are exactly great at self-esteem, and this kinda stuff is really digging into that."

"That's understandable. It's a very important thing for you two. I'm actually glad you're taking it so seriously. And, thank goodness you came here to buy protection on your own volition. I'm sure I don't have to explain the issues that would arise with an unplanned pregnancy. Not just with school, but with your quirk as well. Just remember you love each other. That should conquer your doubts, even if only for the night."

"...This is so weird."

Toshinori patted Izuku's back, "Sure is. Now, go ahead and pick. Stick to the three brands on the right there."

Izuku sighed, raising up his hand, but quickly turned back to Toshinori. "Turn around. In fact, just go shop for what you were here for in the first place."

Chuckling, Toshinori walked away, "When you're done, wait in my truck. I'll give you a ride home." 

Izuku nodded, his blush still strong as he tried to figure out what to pick. Ten agonizing minutes later, Izuku was out at All Might’s truck, wanting nothing more than to just disappear into his seat.

Toshinori threw his bags in the backseat, looking at Izuku, who had his hand covering his eyes. "So, what was it like handing it to the cashier?"

"Please, All Might, just drive."

"Alright, fine." Toshinori turned his keys, the engine roaring to life. His voice clearly holding back a laugh, he continued, "...But, you know you could've just ordered them online, right?"

Izuku slammed his head into the dashboard as Toshinori laughed even harder.

  
  
  
  

***…~AIV~...***

  
  

**(** **Ten Minutes Later: Jirou Household: Living Room** **)**

  
  

Kyouka flipped through the *“History and Catalogs of Quirks”* Momo had gotten Izuku as she laid down on her couch. 

She had passed by Dr. Garaki’s page again, thinking back on what Izuku had said about him the other night. It was still just so creepy. She still knew that logically it was coincidence or a family member or something, but she knew Izuku was serious. He knew that face, and she believed him when he said he’d never forget it.

Maybe some day they’d see that doctor, and Izuku could ask him about the picture.

But, for now, it was another thought locked away in the back of their minds.  

She continued to read, and while she didn’t have the same in-depth devotion to quirks, she fully understood Izuku’s love for them. She couldn’t deny it was interesting. 

She was reading up on the “Quirk Awakening” section, and it was fascinating. 

The ability to evolve one’s quirk instantaneously? That was insane. What would her quirk even evolve to do? Nullify sound? Manipulate soundwaves? Would her jacks extend longer?

Could One For All Awaken? It’s already such a strange quirk. Izuku had mentioned before that his excess power manipulation could be some kind of awakening, but he wasn’t certain. 

Could it awaken again? The book mentioned that it was entirely possible; evolution has no dead end. Maybe she just couldn’t comprehend the idea of Izuku getting more powerful than he already was going to be.

Or was? Actually, now that she thought about it, she had never seen Izuku at full power before. Not that she *wanted* to see him break his arms, but she couldn’t deny her curiosity. Maybe she should ask to see the footage from his entrance exam? It was just hard to remember sometimes that her sweet, kind boyfriend was secretly one of the biggest powerhouses in the world.

And speaking of said boyfriend…

The front door opened, and Kyouka couldn't help but laugh at the sight of Izuku’s horror-stricken face.

 “Well, at least it was a successful mission,” she said as she looked down at the grocery bag in his hand. Kyouka hopped up, chuckling as Izuku continued to blankly stare at nothing. She kissed the corner of his mouth, “Hmhmhm, c’mon, tell me. How bad was it? Did the cashier ask questions? A classmate showed up? C’mon! Details! Details!”

“Details, huh? You think I’m the only one that should be embarrassed about all this?” Izuku jabbed his thumb over his shoulder, pointing out the door. “Look who showed up and graciously decided to help me.”

Confused, Kyouka looked past him, seeing the red truck in her driveway. Kyouka’s eyes went wide as her face went completely crimson. “...No.”

They could see Toshinori laughing in his truck at the sight of Kyouka’s reaction, which was the only reason he was sticking around. He waved as he backed out of the driveway and rode away, cackling the entire time.

“Yep…” Izuku deadpanned, handing Kyouka the grocery bag in question. “You’re going next time.”

  
  
  

***…~AIV~...***

  
  

**(** **Some Time Later: Kamino Ward: Unknown Bar** **)**

  
  
  
  

Tomura raised a brow, looking up at Imasuji. Goto Imasuji, or “Muscular,” was every bit of whackjob, mindless killer Tomura said he would be.

Sure, there was Toga. But, at least Toga had the whole transformation thing, and seemingly a base need for blood-drinking even without using her quirk. Although, it was likely caused by her quirk.

Imasuji just killed to-…well, kill. 

Even serial killers typically had reasons or M.O’s to follow, leading back to some sort of trauma. Muscular just loved death, and only found it acceptable if he was the one doling it out. Anyone, anywhere, anytime.

Tomura already hated him. 

He wanted him gone. A transforming, vampire, schoolgirl shapeshifter he could handle…oddly enough. But, murder adrenaline junkie? Especially one that would probably use any excuse he could to kill, even if told not to?

That was chaos Tomura couldn’t afford. At least, not for long.

“Stain?” Tomura replied. “Everyone else here was inspired by Stain to join. But, not you. If you believe we were working with him, why bother coming?”

Imasuji smiled, wickedly, “Because if you work with him, then that means you’re gonna need people killed. I’m more than happy to do it.”

“Hm, well…You’re very powerful. It’d be foolish to let that kind of strength go to waste,” Tomura replied, pretending to be in deep thought. If he was right about Goto, and so far he was, then rejecting him wouldn’t end well. “I think we have a spot for you.”

“What?” Both men turned to see the other recruit at the meeting: Magne. She scowled up at Muscular before sending a questioning glare towards Tomura. “You’re gonna hire someone who doesn’t even believe in the cause?”

“Yep,” Tomura confirmed, bluntly. “He’s looking for a place where he can be himself. Is it wrong to give that to him? Ideals or no ideals?” 

Was Tomura completely talking out of his ass? Yes. Was he still banking on Muscular getting captured? Oh, absolutely. But, even uses with short expiration dates were still useful, one way or another.

Magne crossed her arms with a sigh, “...I guess not. I can relate…in a less murder-y way, but still with some murder, so…”

“Good.” He turned back to Muscular, nodding towards the back door, “Through there.”

“Nice,” Goto smiled, exiting the bar without hesitation. 

“So…” Tomura turned to Magne, clasping his hands together. “Well, from your input, I can tell you’re quite opinionated.” 

“Guess so.” Magne bowed her head, “Forgive me, I wasn’t intending to be rude. I just wanted to help the cause. But, like I said, I can relate to wanting to live how one chooses.”

“Yeah, I’m beginning to notice a trend with you recruits. But, I digress. Magnetism, right? Attract and repel people depending on their gender?”

“Y-...Yes. How did you know?”

“Some of you, I know your quirks, some I don’t. Quirks, criminal records, etc. It all depends on the information my Giran gives me.”

“If you already know our quirks, our track records, everything…Why the interviews? A villain group in desperate need of help? I didn’t expect you to be so…clinical.” 

“Because while we may be nothing but a bunch of low-life criminals, business is still business. A synopsis on my computer can only tell me so much.”

“Hm…” Magne hummed in response, eyeing Tomura suspiciously. “For instance, it can’t tell you who’s easy to control.”

Tomura scoffed dryly, “Control? I don’t need control, I need people who can do as they are told.”

“But tha-”

“No,” Tomura cut her off, standing up from his barstool. “There’s a *very* big difference. Control means I hold the power of your direction, your mind, your desires. Someone who does what they’re told, is someone I don’t even have to control. They can be trusted, dependable. I don’t need to control someone who believes in what they’re doing, because they’ll fight for it themselves. I don’t need to control somebody who knows they need help, just like we do. So, what do you think about helping each other fight for a world we believe in?”

Magne smirked as Tomura finished, nodding her head. “You know what? I’d like that.”

“Then head on back and acquaint yourself with the others. Or, don’t. I don’t care. The choice is entirely yours.”

“Ha! Just how I like it.” Magne left the room, leaving Tomura and Kurogiri alone once again.

Tomura took the hand off of his face and dismissively tossed it onto the counter. He rested his head into his arms and groaned, “Whose dumbass idea was it to do these meetings two at a time? Whose idea was it to do these meetings at all?”

Kurogiri shifted his eyes before bouncing back, “...Was that rhetorical? Or do I actually need to remind you that this was your idea?”

Tomura raised his head, deadpanning at his friend before putting his head back down. “UA is on summer vacation. Where’s our vacation?”

“It’s the perfect opportunity for us. Their guard is down, they’re relaxing. We have to use this time.” 

"They know we're out here planning. I doubt they're relaxing."

**(** **A Few Hours Later: Jirou Household: Kyouka’s Room** **)**

  
  

Izuku and Kyouka were relaxing on the window seat, bathing in the evening sun. Izuku had been dozing off and on for a while now, only jarred out of his sleepy state by something moving on his stomach.

Izuku peeked open an eye, seeing Kyouka in the same spot as before. She was curled against his side, head resting on his chest. But, she had a notebook open, using Izuku’s body as a makeshift table.

He sighed, nuzzling into her hair, “What are you writing?”

“Sheet music,” Kyouka replied, quietly, her focus still mainly on her writing. “I think I just thought of the perfect melody to something I’ve been working on.”

“What is it?” Izuku sleepily mumbled.

“Your theme song.”

“Oh, cool…” Izuku sighed, relaxing further into the body heat of…Hold up. “Wait. What?!”

Izuku perked up, slumber dissipating from his body instantly. Kyouka chuckled, closing her notebook and tossing it over to her bed. 

“Hatsu-...I mean, Mei, gave my hammer the ability to play music for a reason. The greatest hero needs a theme song.”

“Wh-?! I-?! Really?”

Kyouka leaned up, pecking his lips, “Absolutely.”

“Wow, I-...Th-Thank you! I never thought…What’s it called?”

“You Say Run.”

“...Huh?”

Giggling, Kyouka turned around to lean back against him. “I thought of it a little while ago. It’s the beginning of a phrase I came up with. ‘You Say Run. I Say Fight.’ It’s like a response to somebody telling you to run, to not face the danger. Then, the song itself is the ‘I Say Fight’ portion; the response. Fast paced and heart-pumping. You say run? Well, I say fight. And, bam, theme song.”

Izuku was at a loss for words. Everything they had experienced together was already more than Izuku could ever ask for, but now this wonderful woman was going through the effort of making him *a theme song?*  

Izuku shifted himself, getting in front of Kyouka and looking down at her with amazement in his eyes. “...You’re the perfect woman.”

Kyouka rolled her eyes, red blossoming on her cheeks. “Izuku, c’mon, it’s no-”

“And that’s one of the hottest things you’ve ever done.”

“...Okay, continue.”

“It’s true,” Izuku continued, chuckling. “But…I don’t want it to be my theme song, It should be ours. AMP’s.” 

“Really,” Kyouka grinned.

“Partners, remember? A Hero Duo having theme music for only one of its members doesn’t make much sense to me.”

“I guess not,” Kyouka beamed, playing with one of her jacks. “Okay then. AMP’s theme song.”

“Awesome. Damn, our own theme music? Kid Izuku would be over the moon. I don’t know how I can repay you.”

“I can think of a few ways…” Kyouka smirked, her jacks hooking around Izuku’s neck.

Izuku blushed, moving to be directly over Kyouka, “What were the other options?”

“The same thing, but on either the bed, the couch, or the floor.”

“What about all four?”

“Hmm, an interesting offer.  I’ll have to think abou-Yes.” 

Izuku laughed, leaning down to bring their lips together. Kyouka’s jack left his neck to close the curtains. The last thing they needed was their cover blown from being spotted by a neighbor. They only had a couple of days left. They would make the most of it. Things reached the point of their usual “Hot and Heaviness,” when Kyouka grabbed Izuku’s hand on her hip and broke away from his lips.

Izuku’s brows rose, “You’re giving me the same look from a few days ago. Is this authorization?”

“Pfft! Hehe, authorization?” 

“I-I take this very seriously!”

“Hmhm, well, I guess you’re not wrong. But, not the same as before…” Kyouka brought Izuku’s hand down and around, causing him to immediately shoot his hand off of her.

“R-...Really?”

Kyouka shrugged, hugging her arms to her body, “I-I mean…w-well, what’s so different about touching there, rather than…y-you know…” Kyouka’s jacks suddenly retracted, covering her chest. “...Here.”

“Kyouka, you’ve already allowed me to touch one Body Part of Legend, technically two if you count each as a separate entity. I’m not worthy of another so soon.”

“Body Part of Legend?” Kyouka chuckled. “Really?”

“Do you realize how legendary it is for a teenage boy to touch a pair of boobs?! I’m pretty sure every guy who’s ever bullied me would suddenly respect me…except Kacchan, he might be asexual. Or, he believes everyone isn’t good enough to be with him.”

“Both?”

“Probably. But, my point being, touching your butt? I’ll have to vacuum seal my hand so that nothing else ever actually touches it ever again. And that’s only if I survive. I might melt like the guys at the end of Raiders of the Lost Ark.”

Kyouka, whose face was rose red by that point, deadpanned up at her boyfriend. “Are you gonna touch my ass or not?”

“Yes, ma’am.”

**(** **Kamino Ward: Unknown Bar** **)**

  
  

Finally, the last two recruits came in. Tomura *needed* these meet and greets over with, pronto. 

…Unfortunately, one of them was giving him some trouble. But, oddly not in a bad way.

"Mu-Hmhmhm! Ahem, excuse me. Musta-Hehe! Sorry, okay…" Tomura composed himself, breathing in deep. He looked back over at the middle schooler, making sure there were no more laughs left in his system. "...Mustar-Plhahahaha!"

"I get it, alright?! But it's the gas, not the condiment!" Mustard cried out, growing more irritated by the minute. They had been there for the last ten minutes with Tomura trying to get his villain name out just *once* .

Tomura wiped his eye and shrugged his shoulders, “Well, yeah, but mustard gas isn’t even related to your quirk. You knock them out, right? Mustard gas isn’t a sleeping gas.” 

“Yeah, well you come up with a name for sleeping gas that’s menacing.”

“...Anesthesia? Anesthetic? BZ?”

“...Okay, those aren’t bad, but they’re just the actual names of-”

“Mr. Sandman? Morpheus?”

“I…” Mustard faltered, looking down in deep thought. “...Shit, those are good.”

“Uh-huh,” Tomura chuckled, nodding over his shoulder towards the back door. “No matter what you choose, your quirk is still pretty damn useful. And, you make me laugh. Go ahead and pick a room and get back to me with a new name, Ketchup.”

Mustard grumbled, but walked to the door as told. “Don’t tell me this is gonna be a running joke with you.”

“Then I won’t, Relish.” Tomura laughed as Mustard disappeared through the door, still grumbling under his breath. 

Kurogiri sighed, “Must you insist on antagonizing every new member?”

Tomura smiled in response, “It’s the little things that keep you going. Now…” Turning back to the other recruit, Tomura crossed his arms. “Twice, right?”

The masked man saluted, “Yes! **No!”**

“...S-...So, yes or no? Because if you’re not Twice, I can go ahead and tell you leaving this bar alive is gonna be difficult for you.”

“No! No, I’m Twice. I’m sorry, I just have a thing-**No I don’t!** A-! Ahem! Yes, I’m Twice.”

Tomura peered at the man curiously, resting his elbows on his knees, “..Alright, well, let me guess. You’d like a place where you feel you can belong? While also causing some mayhem in the process of making a better world for yourself?”

Twice looked around, shrugging, “Uh...Pretty much, ye-**NO!** Er, yes.”

“Uh-huh, bit of a trend. Well, we can provide. But, first, cloning yourself, huh?”

“Myself? Ah, not so much, amigo. Doesn’t end well, believe me. But, I can clone everybody else to your heart's content!” Twice exclaimed, proudly. “...Provided that I get exact measurements first. First one’s on the house, the rest are a thousand yen per session!”

“Huh. Not bad at al-”

**“Fifty-thousand!”**

“...Riiight. How about you get measurements of all the other members, those who’ll let you anyway, and I let you join in exchange?”

“You’ve got a deal! **Preposterous! No deal!”** 

“...” Tomura clicked his tongue, bringing his hands together. “So, this ‘thing’? Do you need medication? We can get that.”

“Medication? Do I look sick to you?!”

“...Buddy, I’ve got seven other mentally sick people in the next building, not even including myself. I know a problem when I see it. Unlike the rest of them, you seem somewhat treatable. Well, at least you don’t seem like you’d need a straight jacket and thirty years with the world’s greatest therapist.”

“No, no, I’m quite alright. Just sort of a tic. **Yes! Meds! All of the meds!”**

“...Do you want the job or not?”

“Absolutely! **Negatory!”**

“...Okay, just walk through the backdoor if you want the job.”

“Yes, sir! **Don’t tell me what to fucking do!”**

“...”

“...I’ll walk through the door now.”

“Uh-huh.” Jin left the room, heading up to the apartment building. Tomura shook his head as he turned back to Kurogiri, “How am I the sanest one here?”

“Yes, quite the madhouse you’ve accumulated.”

*“Indeed…”* The television flickered to life, All For One’s voice coming through. *“I think we have enough. For the time being, that is. We don’t need an army right now, merely a small, capable squad.”*

“Let’s hold off on the ‘capable’ for now. We still haven’t seen a single one of them in action.”

*“We know their records, and they speak for themselves.”*

 “Agreed,” Kurogiri chimed in. “However, offering him access to medication? That’s surprising. But, not a bad surprise.”

“We need him stable enough to work,” Tomura waved Kurogiri off. “That last thing we need is for him to have a mental crisis halfway through an operation.”

All For One chuckled, *“Well done. You seem to have things handled from all angles, then. Address your troops, reveal our plans. We have plenty of preparation ahead of us. I have faith in you, Young Tomura.”*

The television flickered off, leaving Tomura and Kurogiri to themselves. Tomura sighed, using his thumb and forefinger to rub his eyes. He was thankful that everybody believed he was doing a good job.

There was just one problem…

Tomura had absolutely no idea what he was doing.
