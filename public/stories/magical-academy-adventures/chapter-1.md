# The Discovery

The morning sun cast long shadows across the cobblestone streets of Willowbrook as Alex hurried through the marketplace. Today was different. Today, something was about to change.

At first, it was just a tingleâa strange sensation that ran along their fingertips as they reached for an apple from a vendor's cart. But then it happened: the apple didn't just fall into their hand. It *floated*.

For a moment, Alex stared in disbelief, the apple hovering just inches above their palm. The vendor's eyes widened, and before Alex could think, they snatched their hand back. The apple dropped, and the spellâif that's what it wasâwas broken.

"What in the..." the vendor began, but Alex was already running.

They didn't stop until they reached the old oak tree at the edge of town, their heart pounding not just from the sprint, but from something else. Something they couldn't name but felt deep in their bones.

*Magic.*

The word came unbidden to their mind, and with it, a flood of questions. Was this real? Had they really just used magic? And if so, what did that mean?

As if in answer, a shimmering letter materialized in the air before them. The parchment was old, yellowed with age, but the writing was crisp and clear:

> *You have been chosen. The Academy of Arcane Arts awaits. Present yourself at the gates by the next full moon.*

Alex reached out, and the letter settled into their hands. The paper felt warm, alive somehow. Across the top, an elaborate seal was pressed into the parchmentâa phoenix rising from flames, surrounded by ancient runes.

"This can't be real," Alex whispered to the empty air.

But even as they said it, they knew. This was real. This was their future.

And it was only just beginning.
