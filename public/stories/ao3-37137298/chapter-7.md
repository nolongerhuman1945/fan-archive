The fall month brought a lot of changes for the pair of farmers. Obviously with a new season came new crops that needed planting, and the work that entailed. Every day came with it a new task that demanded attention, from expanding the fields and crafting enough fertilizer to compensate, to setting up fences around said fields as well as new pens for the farm animals. The coop had recently been expanded to hold ducks and, oddly enough, dinosaurs. Izuku didn’t know if having a literal prehistoric reptile loose on the farm would be bad for the crops, but he wasn’t going to take chances and find out.

Winter was also on the horizon, just one short month away and bringing with it a whole host of necessary preparations. Add in the upcoming Fair, with dedicated displays for the crowds coming to see what the town could produce, and the two farmers could barley find time for themselves.

Luckily, a few days before the Fair a rainstorm came in. With all the fences set up and the watering done for them, Izuku and Kyoka had free time.

That the two immediately used to do more work.

Kyoka decided to go to the mines, hoping to find a valuable gemstone for the centerpiece of their Fair display, while Izuku went down to the pier to spend some time fishing, both to hopefully catch some of the few remaining fish that the Junimo’s were requesting, as well as make some extra money to set aside for winter.

Izuku sat with his feet dangling off the pier while the rain pelted down on him. A sou’wester hat that Izuku bought from a sentient mouse (which is a sentence that he never thought would ever be uttered) kept the rain off his face and his vision clear, while a thick coat made by Emily kept the worst of the weather off him. Not like it mattered that much. Izuku had never minded the rain before and his training on Takoba Beach with Toshinori would take place no matter the weather, so he was well accustomed.

The door to Willy’s shop opened from behind Izuku, and the fisherman walked out with a pole in hand before casting his line out into the water, standing just far enough away to not get the fishing lines crossed. Izuku gave him a nod of acknowledgement before turning back to his own pole. As one of the people who helped himself and Kyoka when the two washed up on the beach, Izuku held a great deal of respect for the man. Even though he could make his own lures and bait for cheaper, the verdanette still bought from Willys shop to help support him as not many in the town were that interested in fishing.

As the sun was beginning to set and the overcast skies slowly grew darker, Izuku was close to packing up for the day when Willy broke the silence between them. “The Fair’s coming up in a few days, you two got your grange display sorted out?” the man said while reeling in a Red Snapper, “I know what’s going in mine.” He said in a mirthful tone.

“For the most part,” Izuku said with a small shrug. “Just kind of nervous, I guess. It’s our first time doing something like this.”

“Ehh, don’t worry so much about it. Lewis likes to make a whole spectacle with the displays, giving them scores and prizes, but as long as you’re proud of what you’re showing that’s all that matters.” Willy recast his line before letting out a laugh. “Corse I might be saying that because I’ve never placed higher than 3rd in those things. I get the feeling Lewis doesn’t like the smell of fresh fish.”

The two kept up the small talk for a little while longer but eventually Izuku took his leave and made his way back home, all the while thinking on the fisherman’s advice. The notion of some form of competition sent him scrambling to put in as much effort as he could in order to make a good impression, but was it really necessary? Sure, he would *like* to win, but this wasn’t the Sports Festival. Even if he and Kyoka were new to farming, Izuku liked to think they had made great progress and some ranking in a local fair wouldn’t change how far the two had come since washing up on the beach. Regardless of what anyone else thought, he could be proud of that.

* * *

“This is… a lot more people than I was expecting.”

Kyoka found herself agreeing with Izuku. The past festivals had been more akin to small gatherings due to the size of the town. The farmers knew the Fair would be different as it was open to the public, but both of them had underestimated just how many people would be in attendance. How many people would take time out of their day just to come to some small farming town?

As it turns out, quite a lot.

The small stone paths that made up Pelican Town’s streets went nearly unseen as people pushed and shoved to get to the next game, shop, or display. Gus was in his element, grilling and serving burgers almost as fast as the crowd could eat them, while several other villagers ran stalls to sell their work or show off their talents. Clint had a rare smile on his face as several members of various Adventuring Guild’s admired his work, while Leah and Haley had small sections to show off their sculptures and photography respectively.

Several venders that Kyoka guessed were run by people from the surrounding towns had been set up, selling things like fresh produce and fertilizer to wine and baked goods. Even the sentient hat selling mouse, Hat Mouse, had brought a tiny wooden wagon filled with various pieces of head wear and skirted around the crowd trying to sell his hats.

While the size of the crowd was far from something like U.A.’s culture festival, neither teen had expected such a turn out to what they thought would be a glorified farmers market. The pair fought their way through the mass of people to get to the area set aside for the grange display’s. Only three other people would be setting up display’s this year, Pierre, Marnie, and Willy. While anyone in town could theoretically participate, most of the town either didn’t produce something to display or chose to forgo the competition to run a stall like Clint and Leah.

“Is it just me or is Pierre way too into this competition?” Kyoka said so only Izuku could hear, which due to the surrounding crowd was just slightly louder than a normal conversation. True to her word, Pierre had clearly put in a lot of effort into his display, the front of his wooden display stall had custom made letters spelling his name and the shop owner was currently making micro-adjustments to the position of his produce, not resting until every single object was exactly where he wanted it.

“I mean… there’s nothing wrong with being a little competitive.” The verdanette responded. Truth be told Izuku thought it was a bit much, but this clearly meant a lot to the man, and who was he to criticize that.

Kyoka didn’t seem to share his thoughts on the matter, however. “I mean, there’s going Plus Ultra, but then there’s just too much. All you get for winning are some tokens you can spend at like, one stall.”

Deciding it was not a good use of his time to argue against his girlfriend on a point he didn’t even disagree with, Izuku instead turned to set up their own display. Emily had arrived the day before with a pair of outfits, only asking for the pair to place a small sign that said both outfits had been made with local resources and labor. The rest of the display was taken up mostly by some animal products and crops, and a few strange purple mushrooms the two found in the mines that Demetrius had told them were fairly valuable. The center piece of their display was a rainbow-colored stone called a ‘Prismatic Shard’ that Kyoka had found during her time in the mines. Gunther, the curator of the town’s museum, informed them of just how rare such a find was, and the two decided to donate the stone only after using it for the display.

After organizing the stall in a way he guessed would be aesthetically pleasing, Izuku took a moment to look at what Marnie and Willy brought. Marnie’s display was filled with animal products, as expected of a rancher, with eggs, bundles of cloth, and jugs of milk surrounding an oversized cheese wheel, while Willy had several boxes of specialty bait and lures as well as several large fish, including the Red Snapper Izuku had seen him catch before. Neither of the two seemed to be as concerned with winning the little competition as Pierre, but both were clearly proud to show the results of their efforts.

“Well, it looks like you two have had a productive year!” Lewis’ voice called out from behind the pair. The mayor took a moment to look over the four displays, cringing for a moment as the ‘fragrance’ from Willy’s stall hit his nose, before turning back to the farmers. “I must say, I didn’t expect such a showing for your first fair, but I guess many hands make for light work. I’m sure old Gregory is resting well with you two running the farm.”

The pair basked in the unexpected praise for a moment, before Izuku spoke up. “Well, what happens now? How long does it take to judge the displays?”

“It doesn’t take long at all, but as for now I’d say you two have earned a break, so just enjoy the Fair.” Kyoka started to voice her concerns over leaving the display unattended, especially with a valuable gemstone front and center, but Lewis assuaged her concerns. “We haven’t had a problem with someone trying to steal from the displays for quite a while, and I always stay close to make sure no one tries. Plus, I got Marlon ready to help out if someone causes trouble.” Lewis motioned to the head of the local Adventure’s Guild, Marlon. The man had long since gone grey and was sporting an eyepatch, but Izuku and Kyoka knew the man was dangerous enough that they felt sorry for anyone that tried to steal with him around.

With their fears of theft dissuaded, the couple toured the fairgrounds. By now a portion of the crowd was moving to the dining area near the fountain to get an early lunch, so the two had a much easier time of moving through the crowd. Leah was busy working on a wooden sculpture, and Maru was demonstrating new inventions to passerby, but the largest group of onlookers was forming around Haley’s attraction, where she had displayed various photographs she had taken over the years, starting from her first picture to the present. Neither teen knew that much about photography, but the improvement in Haley’s skill was obvious to see. Emily was helping her sister with her stall, but this mainly boiled down to offering homemade snacks and gossiping about her and Haley’s childhoods.

After visiting their friends, Kyoka and Izuku spent some time playing the overpriced fair games. The prizes all being ‘star tokens’ to turn in at a vendor did prevent Izuku from getting his girlfriend a large stuffed animal after a display of skill (as is tradition). Seeing the man running the strength tester falter with his strongman persona after Izuku launched the puck so hard it nearly took the bell off was a good substitute, however. “I didn’t take you for a showoff green. Using your Quirk to just impress your date at a fair? How daring.” The violette said with a smirk.

“I mean, who can blame me for wanting to impress a girl as great as you,” “You dork” “But I didn’t use my Quirk though.” Izuku corrected.

“O-oh… w-well, color me impressed then…” The information was surprising even to her. *‘He’s a lot stronger without his Quirk than I gave him credit for.’* While Kyoka had seen his body before, seeing Izuku’s strength in such a display gave her some… ‘scandalous thoughts’ of her boyfriend’s physique. *‘Fuck that’s hot…’  
  
*

The crowd around Gus had thinned while the pair enjoyed the festivities, so the two took the chance to grab some lunch. All the food on offer was complimentary for the event, so nothing was stopping either teen from eating their fill. Kyoka had just finished her second burger when Izuku went in for a 6th, his appetite a consequence of the heightened protein intake needed to fuel his Quirk enhanced muscles. Kyoka took it upon herself to stop Izuku from becoming a one-man cheeseburger apocalypse and dragged him off to see the various shops set up near the river.

Most of the vendors didn’t have anything that interested either farmer, no point in buying fresh produce when it’s your job to grow it after all, but there were a few nick knacks that caught their attention. Kyoka bought a small, hand carved rabbit for Izuku, explaining that his first costume always looked like a green bunny and the image was hard to separate from him, while Izuku bought the girl some new guitar picks.

Izuku was busy purchasing some jerky made out of animals Kyoka didn’t even know could be made into jerky when something caught her eye. Rasmodius, already an odd sight due to his rare attendance to town events, was having a conversation with a woman who looked like a stereotypical fortune teller, crystal ball included. After following his girlfriend’s gaze to the tent and noticing the Wizard, Izuku chimed in, “Do you think they know each other?” The boy wanted to thank the man once more for healing his arm, but the Wizard had apparently finished whatever business he had and quickly left in the direction of his tower. “I think so, I couldn’t hear them over the noise, but the conversation seemed friendly.”

“Well, do you want to ask? Besides, if she can actually tell the future, it might be interesting to learn.” The notion of magic had intrigued Izuku, but as it turns out such forces being confirmed to exist didn’t reduce the number of fake psychics and similar scammers, but actually did the opposite. After completing a job for the Wizard from the town’s notice board, Rasmodius advised the two to be cautious, as there are many people who fake such talents for profit.

“Nah, even if she can tell the future I’d rather let it be a surprise.” After visiting most of the attractions the fair had to offer, Kyoka and Izuku decided to return to the display area and see how they placed. Both had low expectations as it was their first year at the farm but were pleasantly surprised to see a large 1st place ribbon on the front of the stall.

The two collected their prize, 1,000 tokens, all while blushing from the praise of their neighbors. Even Pierre stopped by to congratulate them, but not before offering a challenge to see who wins next year, something both teens found oddly familiar. “Why is it no matter what we do, people are throwing out declarations of war.” Izuku said while he thought of the days before the Sports Festival. Kyoka could only offer a shrug in response. It actually felt nice being the target of such a challenge for once, as all the previous challenges at U.A. had been levied at Class 1-A as a whole or Midoriya specifically. Not that she would say such a thing out loud.

The last stop for the two was the prize booth placed just before the path to the bus stop, and beyond it their farm. Kyoka had a lucky streak at the gambling game (which was literally just picking between two colors for a wheel to land on), and combined with their prize tokens, they had just enough for a scarecrow that reminded Izuku of an old pre-Quirk movie character, and something called a ‘Stardrop’. The man who ran the stall said it was a mysterious fruit that helped draw out latent energy in whoever consumes it, and that the taste was unique to each person. Such a ‘mysterious and valuable’ fruit being sold at a fair’s prize table made the two farmers doubtful of the claims, but with none of the other offerings standing out the pair decided to split it.

All doubts faded away the moment the fruit passed their lips. As Izuku swallowed, the taste of the Stardrop filled his mind with memories of eating his mother’s katsudon, both parents on either side of him before his father left them because he was born wrong went to work overseas. Right before the taste and memories faded from his mind, the scene shifted. His childhood apartment morphed into the farmhouse, and instead of his parents Izuku was dining with Kyoka and a small green-haired child with earphone jacks.

Kyoka’s mind was taken to family music nights, and the joy she felt learning how to play whatever instrument caught her attention. Like with Izuku, the scene changed near the end, now she and Izuku were the ones cheering on a purple haired child with diamond pattern freckles happily stumming away on a guitar.

A taste that brought up vivid memories (and more) was not the only oddity of the Stardrop however. It was subtle, possibly a consequence of splitting the fruit in half, but both farmers felt… better. Not only did both of them feel like they had gotten the best rest of their lives, but Kyoka could swear the crowd of the fair had just gotten a little bit louder. Izuku had a much more subdued effect, he simply felt like he had a particularly good workout, but without the fatigue and strained muscles.

If he could hear the vestiges of One for All however, Izuku would have instantly learned that the Stardrop not only affected his body but his Quirk as well. The past wielders, being a part of the Quirk, had all felt the jolt of power after consuming the fruit. It wasn’t that much of one, the 9th One for All user wouldn’t be throwing out 100% smashes anytime soon, but the fruit didn’t just make the boy able to handle more power, it strengthened the Quirk itself.

“Alright,” The first holder said to his successors, “The next person to talk to Nine, tell him to find more of those things. All agreed?” A chorus of affirmations rang out in the dark mindscape that made up One for All, while Izuku and Kyoka walked back to the farm for a quiet evening together.

* * *

The bus stop near the farm was bustling with activity, as nearly half the town was waiting to board the bus headed for Zuzu city. After almost 3 months of practicing, Sam, Sebastian, and Abigail felt ready enough to hold their first performance. It was far from glamorous, the venue was little more than a rundown park near an old apartment complex, but a gig was a gig.

“Kyoka, Izuku! Glad you could make it!” Abigail called out to the pair when she saw them arrive. Sam had visited the two a few days before to inform them of the concert and offer tickets. While neither farmer would be preforming on stage, the trio treated both Kyoka and Izuku as honorary members for helping the band find its style.

“Wouldn’t miss it.” The violette said as she neared the bus. “Besides, we live literally a stone’s throw away. We could hear you guys from the front door.” She continued while pointing a jack to the roof of the farmhouse, still visible over the tree line.

Sebastian, now done checking over the packed instruments, chimed in. “I’m just glad the town’s bus got repaired. Renting a different one would be too expensive, and I don’t think all the gear would fit on my motorcycle.” The bus behind Sebastian, which once sat rusted over and abandoned, was now practically shining and ready to go. By this point Kyoka and Izuku had stopped questioning exactly how a group of tiny forest spirits knew how to repair infrastructure and large vehicles, instead simply taking such happenings in stride.

“Well, I think everyone that said they were coming is here.” Sam said while looking over the gathered crowd. Most of the younger residents had come to support the band, as well as Sam’s mother Jodi and his younger brother Vincent. The rest of the town simply couldn’t make the time to attend, busy with work or other obligations, but still offered their support, nonetheless.

After loading everyone onto the bus, the trip to Zuzu city passed by rather quickly with the occupants mostly engaging in small talk or focusing on personal hobbies. As the bus pulled into the city and the town members piled out, Izuku and Kyoka took a look around the new surroundings. The city was reminiscent of places like New York or Chicago, at least judging by the pictures the two had seen.

The concert wouldn’t be held for another hour, even though the venue was small there was still a myriad of tests and checks to make sure all the audio equipment was working properly, so that left the two farmers with some time to kill.

“So, where do you want to go fir-AHHH.” Izuku’s question was interrupted as Kyoka grabbed hold of his hand and dragged him to the first music store she saw. With the bus rendered inoperable until a few days ago, the punk girl never had the opportunity to browse a music store in person since the day she had washed ashore in Pelican Town, and Kyoka wasn’t about to waste this opportunity.

“First things first, I’m getting a new guitar. I refuse to keep playing that beat up spare Sam keeps around. An acoustic would be nice, but if I can find some amps an electric would be good too.” Izuku decided to indulge her, only deciding to step in if she came close to buying out an entire music store. He was just (for once in his life) glad he couldn’t buy any Hero merchandise, as the combined cost of their purchases and lack of self-control might legitimately run the risk of bankrupting the pair. “Plus, I need to find something for you as well. You’re pretty good at the guitar already, but even if he’s not here my dad would freak if I ever married a guy who couldn’t play at least two instruments.”

“Wait, what?”

“N-nothing!” The now blushing girl quickly tried to cover up her slip of the tongue. Izuku let the matter go, too embarrassed to push it further. Even if the two were a lot more comfortable showing their relationship publicly, the prospect of marriage was still a bit much for two 16-year old’s.

“W-why don’t we check out that music store?” Izuku attempted to distract from the awkward moment. “Then we can get something to eat before the concert.”

After making their purchases (an acoustic guitar and an electric keyboard) and arranging them to be shipped to the farmhouse, the couple searched for a place to eat. To Izuku’s dismay he was unable to find a spot that served anything even remotely close to katsudon, and the two settled on a small hole in the wall pizza place near the concert venue.

By the time the pair had arrived at the concert grounds it was almost time for the band to perform. All of the town members had arrived by this point, and a few people were left trickling in to hear the new band. Sam stepped in front of the microphone to address the small but passionate audience. “H-hello Zuzu city!” The cheers he received eroded the nervousness Sam felt, and after a quick glance to his band mates, he spoke out to the excited crowd once more. “We’re from Pelican Town, and this is our first gig! So, I hope you all enjoy the debut of our band, ‘Deep Dope’!”

As the trio started to play their first song Izuku turned to inspect his girlfriends face, but Kyoka seemed adamant in avoiding his gaze. “Really Kyo?” He asked.

“I don’t know what you’re talking about.” She said, knowing full well what he was talking about.

“So, three of our friends formed a band and just so happened to name themselves after *your* favorite band, despite having no way to even know of them?”

Kyoka finally turned to face him. “Hey, I didn’t make them chose anything, I just threw out the name and they liked it.” She confessed, before turning the tables on her boyfriend. “And besides, I know if you could be a Hero here then you would name yourself after All Might. No one is as much of a fanboy as you are.” Izuku tried to form a rebuttal but was cut off by Kyoka pointing an earphone jack inches from his face. “Don’t even try to lie about it, we both know you would.”

Izuku chuckled a bit to himself while rubbing the back of his head. “I mean… you’re probably right.”

The concert went well, and the neo Deep Dope had the audience cheering and dancing for nearly the entirety of their set. After selling out of demo tapes, the band packed up and head back to the bus to find all the town members who came out in support waiting to congratulate them for a successful concert. After a ride back to town Jodi forced every member of the band into a group photo to commemorate ‘her little rock star’ having his big debut. As Kyoka and Izuku looked on at the scene, the rocker girl was just thankful she could help her new friends to pursue their passion.

The fact that she may soon be able to buy Deep Dope merchandise again was just a bonus.
