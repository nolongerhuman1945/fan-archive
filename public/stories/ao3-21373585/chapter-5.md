**(One Week Later: Kyouka's Room)**

"Aw c'mon, Deku."

*"I'm really sorry, Kyouka. I have to keep up on my training or I'll just continue to break my bones. I've already missed out on a lot of time this week,"* Izuku explained over the phone with heavy breathing, indicating that he was in the middle of a run whilst making the call.

On her bed, Kyouka grimaced a little bit as she felt that it was partly her fault. He probably missed out on his training just to be with her.

...That thought then caused the guilt to turn into a flutter in her heart. To him, she was more important.

"Yeah, I get it," Kyouka shook her head to clear her thoughts, still a little disappointed. She felt like a spoiled child begging for a toy. She was still going to see Izuku that day, but she was complaining that she would get him for less time than usual. What a selfless hero, right? "I guess I should get my own training in, too. I haven't exercised since the entrance exam."

*"...I-I mean...you could join me."*

"Hm?"

*"If we're both going to train, why not do it together? We're going to see each other anyway, so we could just meet now. You don't even have to train with me! I could just use the company. I'm going to Dagobah Beach if you want to join."*

Kyouka's lips pursed and her brows rose, "That's... actually a really good idea."

U.A was still just under a month away, but just because she already got in didn't mean she could slack off. And Izuku was jacked, so he clearly knew what he was doing. She wasn't looking to get buff or anything, but being in shape was important for a hero. Although, there was one thing she needed to know to seal the deal.

*"So does that mean you're coming?"*  

"Before I answer, quick question: Do you workout shirtless?"

*"Uh, s-sometimes. Wait, why?"*

"No reason. On my way." She ended the phone call before she could be questioned further and walked into her closet. Kyouka changed into purple sneakers, black joggers, a black tank top, and zipped up a deep blue sweat jacket. As Kyouka was leaving her closet, she paused and looked to the back.

Hm...the beach.

Just for a split second, Kyouka looked back into her closet. On a hanger in the back was a yellow bikini her mother had bought her, without Kyouka's permission of course. It would be a nice way to cool off after a workout.

...Yeah, right. She was never going to wear that thing. Over her dead body.

It wasn't that she didn't like how it looked. Granted, yellow wasn't her absolute favorite color, but it was still nice. She was more akin to green nowadays. But, no, Kyouka was never going to wear it because she thought it would never look good *on her* . She thought her body wasn't meant for bikinis, or anything of the sort. Hell, she didn't like swimsuits in general.

She pressed her lips together and rolled her eyes, flicking off the lights and leaving the bikini alone. Pushing down the pain in her chest, she grabbed her bag and walked out the door.

***...~AIV~...***

**(Twenty Minutes Later: Dagobah Municipal Beach Park)**

After grabbing a few water bottles from the kitchen and telling her parents where she was going, Kyouka was on her way. It didn't take all that long to reach Dagobah, but when she did Izuku was already doing push-ups in the sand. 

With a shirt on…

*'Damn it.'* Kyouka looked around the beach a little surprised. When she looked up the location of the beach, all of the pictures showed the place completely covered in garbage and scrap. But, the beach looked pristine. Not a single spec of trash was to be seen. If more people knew about it, it would be a popular hotspot.

Kyouka hopped down the steps and began walking towards her friend. Her jacks began picking up what he was saying under his breath. *"214...215...216…"*

Kyouka stopped in her tracks. Either Izuku didn't know how to count, or he had actually done over 200 push-ups...and didn't look like he was slowing down. What exactly did she just sign up for?

"Be honest, did you choose the beach because you like Rocky III? Because I'm not racing you."

Izuku looked up at Kyouka, holding a planking position as he chuckled, "No, I already fought Mr. T last week."

"Ooh, trying to be the funny one in this friendship now?"

Izuku stopped his push ups and stood up in a plain light blue shirt and basketball shorts. "N-No, I can't win that title."

Kyouka placed her bag down and unzipped her jacket. "Good. You're already 'The Brains' and 'The Muscle'. I need to bring something to this dynamic besides 'The Girl Character'."

"I-I'm not all that smart. And I helped you with your homework like you asked, and from what I saw I'd say we can both be the brains. And you have the 'The Looks' hands down."

Kyouka blushed heavily and looked away, the flutter coming back. She knew it was a common trope he was referring to, but still. Was he really so socially dense that he had no clue what exactly he was saying? "At this point, we're both 'The Wildcard'. I don't think either one of us is very good at predicting the other. But, that leaves you with two and me with five including the ones you just gave me. Unless you want to be the chick?"

"I'll take my two, thanks."

Kyouka chuckled at their banter and let her jacket fall off her shoulders and into her bag. Even in a tank top Izuku blushed and turned away. What could he say? She looked good in everything. "So, how are we going to start?"

"Oh! To be honest I thought we would just do our own individual training."

"What, you think I can't handle it?"

"N-No! Not at all! I-I jus-"

Kyouka's laughter halted his panic, "Hmhmhm, I'm messing with you. I could hear how many push-ups you did. I definitely can't handle that, believe me. But, what about a light version? A super watered-down version? A version that actually won't kill me?"

Izuku smiled and rubbed the back of his head, "I guess I can do that. What I do now is still hard, but I worked my way up to it. I don't need to go heavy today, so I can do an easier version with you."

"Pfft. Hard for you? Look at yourself. You're like a Greek statue."

"I-I'm not that-"

\**Smack* \*

Kyouka punched Izuku directly in the chest as hard as she could. He didn't even move, and she was fairly certain her hand hurt more than his chest. "You didn't even feel that, did you?"

"...N-Not really."

"Great, now I can't tell if you're just that fit, or if I'm just weak. Might as well make sure it's not the second one." Kyouka began stretching her muscles out, "Alright, what do we do first?"

***...~AIV~...***

**(One-and-a-Half Hours Later)**

"I hate you."

"K-Kyouka, you don't mean that...Right?"

"You said you'd give me the easy version."

"...But, that was the eas-

"Don't. Finish. That. Sentence." Kyouka groaned with half of her face in the sand. She knew that the work to get a body like Izuku's was tough, but what she had gone through wasn't a workout. 

It legally classified as torture.

By no means was Kyouka out of shape. But, there was a difference between being in shape and being the image that shows up when you search "being in shape".

"Why would you do this to me? I thought we were friends."

"You made it through though! When I first started this workout regiment, I couldn't get through the first 10 minutes without throwing up." Kyouka's performance actually had impressed him. He never had any doubt that she would do well, but All Might's workout routine could be ruthless at times. It could still be painful even for someone like Izuku who had become used to it. But, Kyouka pulled through.

Izuku also felt a little guilty as he had zoned out and skipped a few sets during the workout, so Kyouka did a little more than he had. He...had a lot on his mind.

...And that didn't mean being distracted by watching Kyouka's muscles as she worked out.

*Not at all.*

"I think that's enough for the day."

"If you didn't say that and I could move my arms, I would've punched you." Izuku chuckled as he helped her up and moved her towards the stone wall at the back of the beach near Izuku's own bag. The two sat against the wall, resting their bodies after their long morning. The sun wasn't at its highest yet, but it was close to noon. "Hey, there's some water and snacks in my bag. Can you go grab it? I would, but my legs feel like someone replaced the muscles with Jell-O."

"Of course." Izuku hoisted himself back up and jogged towards her bag. He picked it up and began walking back to Kyouka. He opened the bag to grab and hand her a water bottle, but froze. 

Kyouka saw his reaction and looked at him confused, "What?"

Izuku's face went completely red as he shut the bag, "N-Nothing! Nothing, just uh...here." The inheritor handed Kyouka the bag and sat back down next to her. "I-I just didn't pack my own. I didn't think we were actually going to swim here."

Kyouka's eyes went wide and she immediately yanked her bag open to reveal the yellow bikini from her closet and a note.

*"When you told us you were going to the beach, I slipped this in here before you left. I figured you might want to wear it and he might want to see it. Wink."*

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      *-Love, Mom.*

How?! *HOW?!*

She had maybe left her bag alone for like, fifteen seconds. How the hell did her mother manage to go get the swimsuit and stuff it in the bag? Whatever, she could dwell on it later. Her mother left her to deal with the aftermath. 

"I didn't put this in here. My mom did. She probably thought we'd be swimming, too." Kyouka groaned, decidedly leaving out the true reasoning as to why her mother put the swimsuit in.

She moved the swimwear out of the way and grabbed two waters, handing one to Izuku. He unscrewed the cap and cleared his throat, a blush still adorning his face. "O-Oh. Well, I guess that's a safe assumption since we're at a beach."

It was a nice day out, a swim didn't actually sound that bad.

But, 1: He didn't have his swimming trunks with him.

And 2: He wasn't ready to see Kyouka in a swimsuit.

...A swimsuit.

...A bikini, to be exact.

A thousand different images began flooding his mind of her wearing said bikini, and his heart began pounding. Izuku shook his head and took a drink of water, only to spit it out immediately. It tasted metallic, of all things? He lifted the bottle to see the top of the water was a misty light pink. It was almost as if a drop of bloo-...

Izuku felt under his nose to find a tiny trail blood; a result of his thoughts about Kyouka in the swimsuit. He quickly wiped away the red liquid before Kyouka could notice and acted as if it didn't happen. 

Kyouka closed her eyes as the sun basked over her. "So, you ready for U.A, Green Bean?"

"Yeah. I've been waiting my whole life to go there. Now I get to go with you. I've never been more excited."

"I'm actually a little nervous. What if we don't get in the same class? I've also heard that some of the teachers there are pretty rough. What if they look at my quirk and think it's useless or something?"

"You're asking the guy who breaks his bones every time he uses his quirk."

Kyouka chuckled, "Fair point."

"And your quirk isn't useless at all! It's so cool! There's so much you can do with it!" Izuku quickly grabbed his own bag and pulled out his notebook, flipping through the pages for the one he was looking for.

"Is that one of the notebooks you told me about?"

"O-Oh, yeah" Izuku said, a little embarrassed as he continued to skim through the book.

Kyouka saw the cover of the notebook and looked at Izuku questioningly, "Volume 13 2.0?"

"This is the second version of that volume. The original was uh... destroyed."

Kyouka saw how Izuku said that and squinted at him, breaking him down with her look alone, "Destroyed how?"

"It's nothing, I-" Izuku tried to deflect the question, but Kyouka's gaze was unwavering. Besides, he said he didn't want to lie to her. He doubted he could have anyway. "...Kacchan blew it up and threw it in a fountain."

Kyouka turned back to the beach and scowled at the ocean, "I swear, one day I'm gonna kick him in the balls. Hard. Wearing a boot." Izuku didn't like needless harm, but he couldn't help but chuckle at the image. Kyouka gestured towards the notebook, "Can I see?"

"Really?"

"Yeah, I'm interested."

Not only did she not find it weird, but she found his notebooks interesting? A rogue image of Kyouka in the bikini reading his notebooks appea-

*'STOP!'* Izuku internally screamed as he handed her the book, "Here."

Kyouka took the notebook from his hands and began flipping through the pages, her eyes widening on the first entry she found. "Woah! Holy crap, this is insane!"

*'Uh-oh. Now she sees it and realizes how weird it is. This is the part where she leaves and never talks to m-'*

"You never said you could draw!" The notebook was suddenly put back in front of his face with the sketch of Mt. Lady he had made almost a year prior on the page. "That's *really* good. Like, scary good. That's professional level."

"I don't know about that, but th-thanks. I've been doing this since I was five, so I guess I've picked up on a few things."

"I'd say this is way more than a few." Kyouka began skimming through the lines and looked baffled. "You've really thought of everything for her. Zoning, bridge and building evacuations...Ooooh, okay."

"What?"

Kyouka smirked as she pointed to the bullet point on the side of the page.

-   *Sexy*

Izuku began frantically waving his hands, his face burning up. "Ah! It's not what you think!"

"So you don't find Mt. Lady sexy? It's even underlined."

"I-I mean, she's a very pretty woman, b-but-"

"So you admit it!"

"No! I-I meant sexy in terms of her hero work."

Kyouka squinted at him suspiciously, "Explain."

"Well, she's a newcomer. A lot of new heroes are always trying to find new ways to gain popularity to boost their rankings besides the amount of crimes busted and such. From what I've seen, she's chosen sex appeal as one of her options. Kind of like Ms. Midnight...except more subtle...Well, a little subtle...Okay, she's not subtle, but still."

"Not subtle how?"

"She purposely shows off her butt...a lot."

"So you stare at her ass?"

"Kyouka!"

Kyouka began laughing hysterically, much to Izuku's dismay, "Alright, I'm kidding. Kidding...but, you did."

"It's not exactly easy to avoid when she's 20 meters tall and shoving it in your face!" Izuku then froze, and Kyouka's eyes went wide.

"..."

"...I shouldn't have phrased it like that."

"Pffft! Hahahahaha! Hahahahaha!" Izuku put his head in his hands as Kyouka's uncontrollable laughter echoed throughout the entire beach. Izuku usually would have been completely embarrassed, but with Kyouka it was different. Her laughter was just as infectious as it was beautiful. 

"Hehehe!" Izuku began chuckling right alongside her, the humor of his words dawning on him. "You're never going to let me live that one down, are you?"

Kyouka wiped a tear from her eye and held her now hurting stomach, "I would usually say no, but you give me so much good material that I might have to move on to a different joke."

Kyouka let him off easy (this time) and turned back to the notebook, flipping through more pages until she reached one that made her falter.

A page of herself.

She had asked herself what Izuku saw when he looked at her, and now she was convinced he needed glasses. The sketch had to be a different woman wearing a Kyouka costume. The teenage girl in the sketch looked amazing. It even looked as if Izuku put in more effort on that drawing then the rest of them. 

Was that seriously what Izuku thought she looked like?

Well...he only called Mt. Lady pretty. He told Kyouka she was "breath-taking." The musician didn't know the exact scale of the descriptions of beauty, but breath-taking sounded a whole lot better than simply pretty. "I feel like your drawing of me is a bit too generous."

"Hm? Did I mess something up?" Izuku quickly took the notebook and began looking back and forth between the sketch and Kyouka, his brow furrowing in confusion. "... Actually, I'm usually not one to toot my own horn. Most of the time I'm pretty critical of myself, but I'm actually really proud of this one. I don't see the mistake."

Kyouka donned a light blush, her eyes shifting away, "Is that really what you think I look like?"

"...Uh, yeah?" Izuku said, giving her a look of confusion. He said it as if the answer should be obvious. Which, to be fair, it was a fairly quizzical question without any context. 

"You're so strange," Kyouka smiled as she took the notebook back, leaving Izuku still confused. Kyouka read over her quirk's notes and was surprised at the subsection at the bottom of the page. "Are these...gear ideas?"

Oh, yeah! I thought they would be cool. I don't know a lot about design and tech, but everything there is possible to make. There have been much more complicated pieces of tech. Do you have ideas of your own?"

Kyouka grabbed her phone and pulled up the picture of her hero costume design. "This is what I'm sending in to U.A."

Izuku began gawking over everything. "That's so cool! It really fits with your aesthetic. And, are those speakers in your boots?"

"Yep. My jacks will plug into them and boost my soundwaves to do damage. Although…" Kyouka reread the gadget ideas, honing in on one particular bullet point. "These are actually pretty freaking awesome. Are those speakers for my hands?"

"Yeah. Now that I know you have speakers on your boots, that actually makes them work even better. You're evened out across your whole body, and it would take less time to plug them into your hands."

Kyouka pointed to another bullet point, "What about the headphones?"

"Honestly, I just put them there for the design. I thought they really fit for you."

"Hmmm," Kyouka bit the inside of her cheek in thought. "It says here that my quirk would be very useful for infiltration and hostage situations. What if they enhance my hearing even more?"

"Oh yeah! That's a great idea."

"And what about...wait. Hand-to-Hand combat effectiveness: Exemplary? Last I checked, earlobes aren't exactly the most efficient in a fist fight."

"Really? But, yours are essentially like two extra appendages that can jab and stun people!"

Kyouka lifted a brow, raising her jacks out in front of her to gaze at them, "I've never thought about it like that. You really think I can fight with my jacks?"

"Of course! I mean, you're going to need some protection for them since they'll be even more of a target. Maybe some metal casing. How durable are they? I would assume like normal earlobes, but the ends are like metal so that also begs the question of is the rest of it as durable, not to mention that a lot of physically changing quirks are different than the rest of the human body since they are technically evolved forms of the bod-"

"Mutter-Mouth, you need to breathe at some point."

"Hm? Oh!" Izuku quicky realized his lungs were burning, taking a deep breath. 

"Maybe you are just 'The Muscle'. But, I get what you're saying if I could make out... whatever all that was. I'd say my jacks are pretty sturdy. One time they got run over by a car."

"What?"

"When I was little and they first came in, I wasn't all that great at moving them around. I could make them extend, but I had a hard time shortening them. So, one day as my family and I were walking down the street, my jacks were on the ground and it just so happens someone was driving really close to the sidewalk. It hurt and they were bruised, but as you can see they're just fine. Hell, we met because one of those damn two ton bots at UA fell on one."

"You're right. It's still something to think about though."

Kyouka looked back over the notes and turned to Izuku, "Do you think you can help me with this? Do you know how to fight?"

Luckily, All Might didn't leave "How to fight" out of his workout plan. At least, for the most part. "Some basic street-fighting and brawling stuff. A bit of boxing and wrestling. I don't know any extensive martial arts or anything."

"Do you have money to pay for martial arts classes?"

 Izuku shook his head, "Not for an extended amount of time. Maybe a half a year's worth. By that point we'll be in UA."

"Everything you know plus YouTube videos it is then. I haven't sent in the design, so I can add this stuff on now. Thanks, Izuku. You, and that big brain of yours." 

Izuku gave her a warm smile in return, "No problem. It's almost noon. Should we go eat something?"

"I would, but we're all sweaty. I gotta shower."

Ignoring the thought of Kyouka in the shower, Izuku shifted his eyes, "Oh, right. Sweaty…"

Kyouka narrowed her eyes at him, noticing nothing glinting off of his brow in the sun. "...Let me feel your forehead."

"No I ju-" It was too late. Kyouka had already put her hand on his forehead, and then began putting her hands everywhere. *'So...close…'*

"You're not sweating at all! None of that was hard for you! You basically just sat there and watched me suffer for two hours!"

"You asked for it! Literally!"

*'Shit, he's right.'* Kyouka donned a faux scowl and packed up her things. "Whatever. C'mon, since I'm the only one disgusting at the moment, we can just go back to my place so I can shower. You're due for another music lesson anyway." As she tried to stand, her legs wobbled and she had to lean against the wall. "Ah, what the-?"

Izuku quickly realized what was wrong, holding her arm to help her remain steady. "Oh yeah. That workout routine can do that to you. In my first week of training I had to get home by rolling belly-down on an old skateboard I found when all the trash was here. My legs were useless. Do you need help?"

"No, I got iiiAAAH!" Kyouka tried to stand up but soon realized that it wasn't an option. Before she could fall in the sand Izuku caught her and brought her back to him. Both went flush as their bodies pressed against one another. "Y-You wouldn't happen to have that skateboard still, would you?"

"S-Sorry, no. Hmm...we could, uh…" Izuku, having experienced the same feeling Kyouka was, knew that she wouldn't get far trying to walk. Not to mention cramping. Izuku looked deep within himself and summoned every single last drop of confidence he had.

...And by God, it was somehow even less than he was expecting. But, his desire to help pulled through and the teen bent down in front of Kyouka. "Hop on."

"W-...Wh-What?"

"I know for a fact that you won't get far. I've tried, it doesn't work. I'll take you home."

Kyouka's mind ran a mile-a-minute at the idea. She shook her head, "It's okay. I'm alright."

"It's really okay, Kyouka. I didn't really get a workout anyway. This can make up for it."

"You calling me fat, Mop-Top?"

"What?! Not at all! I'm just saying-"

"Messing with you is so easy." The punk let out a shaky sigh, "But, I know my limits, and those stairs are pretty daunting. Actually, the walk to the stairs is scary alone. Just no funny business."

"Wouldn't dream of it. I like my eyes where they are." Kyouka eased her way into Izuku's back. And by "ease", that means essentially flopped onto his back with no leg muscles to support her. Izuku picked up her legs and she wrapped her arms around his neck. Izuku lifted her up and began to walk off the beach.

Izuku was having an extremely difficult time with the fact that Kyouka's breasts were pressing into his back. Well, her whole (pleasantly warm) body was pressing against his, but her chest was the most standout feeling. Her breath on his neck didn't help either. Kyouka was having similar troubles with how chiseled Izuku's back felt, and his hands under her thighs. The only way she was getting through it was through conversation. "Now that you helped me with my quirk, I gotta help you with yours."

Izuku chuckled, "Do you have a way to stop a quirk from being so strong that it breaks my bones?"

"... You're on your own with that one."

"It's okay. I'll get a handle on it eventually. It's why I train so hard; so my body can someday withstand my quirk."

Kyouka nodded, sighing against his shoulder, "You said you began training at the beach when the trash was still there. What happened?"

"I cleaned it all."

Kyouka's eyebrows shot up, "Seriously?"

"Yeah, my mentor made it a part of my training. Getting stronger and doing a public service."

"Who's your mentor?"

Izuku faltered for a second, scrapping together a quick explanation. "U-Uh...A man named Toshinori. He was the first person to tell me I could be a hero, and he helped me get to where I am today."

As much as he didn't want to lie, half-truths would have to do for the One For All situation. At least, for now. Who knew what the future held?

"Sounds like a good guy."

Izuku couldn't help but smile to himself, "The best."

"But, he's an asshole for making that workout routine."

Izuku laughed, "He had good intentions."

"Murder isn't a good intention." Izuku once again laughed as they continued to walk down the street further into the edge of the city. With the exhaustion from training, Izuku's warmth on her front, and the sun spreading heat on her back, sleep began overtaking Kyouka.

She was out like a light, and Izuku was more than aware of it as Kyouka had suddenly put her face into the back of his neck, her hot breath blowing onto his skin. As her arms tightened around his neck in her sleep, Izuku decided to not take the train and walk the whole way.

To let her sleep, and to cherish every second of it.

***...~AIV~...***

**(Some Time Later: Jirou Household)**

Mika left her home studio and walked towards the kitchen for lunch. But, as she walked through her living room, something in the window caught her eye. Izuku was carrying her sleeping daughter towards the house with a smile on his face.

Of course, this would be most mothers opportunity to poke at or continue to push a relationship. However, over the course of the two-and-a-half weeks, nearing month, that Izuku had been in the house constantly, Mika realized that there was no pushing needed. The two teens were like two rivers that eventually joined into one. The current simply hadn't reached that point. But, it would. So, Mika quickly grabbed a few things from the fridge and made herself scarce before the teens made it inside, leaving them in peace.

...She still didn't regret the bikini though. Mika knew her daughter wasn't going to wear it...yet. It wasn't for Kyouka to wear. It was for Izuku to see. Her final push before letting nature take its course.

With Mika gone, the front door opened and Izuku walked inside, closing the door with his foot. To his dismay, it was time to wake Kyouka up. He began lightly shifting his shoulders around to jostle her from slumber. "We're here."

*\*Jab\**

"Ow! Why!?"

Kyouka yawned and took her jack out of Izuku's side. "Never shake me awake."

Izuku placed her down and rubbed his side, "Noted."

"Thanks for the lift," Kyouka said, stretching her limbs out. Izuku averted his eyes as she stretched out her back, bringing her chest forward. "My legs are starting to feel somewhat usable again. Let's see if I can make it up the stairs. I'm gonna go hop in the shower. I'll call you up when I'm done. Help yourself to anything in the fridge." 

As Kyouka (wobbly) made her way up the steps, Izuku sat down on the sofa, allowing his heart rate to slow. That workout had easily been the best in his life. Whatever fire that was burning in his chest had come into contact with some sort of explosive material and engulfed his mind with emotions. He wanted to say something to her so badly, but he couldn't. He had One For All and UA to focus on. All Might definitely wouldn't want any distractions, and he was *Izuku Midoriya*. Kyouka might be willing to be his friend, but to be attracted to him was pushing it.

Even that girl that tried to give Izuku her points in the entrance exam said it. 

He was plain.

Forgettable. 

Uninteresting.

Dull.

Maybe his mind was just making up excuses because he was scared. He'd rather just stay friends over being rejected and having their friendship never be the same. But, wasn't part of being a hero facing your fears no matter how scared you were? Like telling a stunningly beautiful girl that you like her; and that you can't stop thinking about her in her yellow bikini?

Izuku slapped himself to shake him out of his train of thought. Being forced into being an anti-socialite for basically his entire life actually made puberty not as embarrassing. He didn't speak, so he didn't voice crack and he was invisible to most, so they didn't watch him go through his awkward stages.

However, he never spoke to girls or had crushes on them. Mostly due to the fact that they already avoided him and/or didn't know he existed. Also, he didn't really look at a lot of them. Most of his school days were spent looking down at his feet or in his notebook. But, now that he finally had an extremely strong attraction to someone, all of the feelings and such that he had missed out on decided to come back with a vengeance. 

And, they hit him hard. *Very hard.*

He knew vivid dreams would happen. He's had them before, but mostly about some female hero he had seen. He would always wake up not really caring. He didn't truly feel anything towards them. It was just his mind trying to fulfill its needs. 

But, Kyouka...He didn't have enough time in the day to describe every dream he had about her. The biggest difference between his old dreams and his Kyouka-Dreams were that when he woke up from a Kyouka-Dream his heart felt funny. Then he would just devolve into the same train of thought he was at a few minutes ago.

It was a vicious cycle. He was going to cave-in eventually. It wasn't a matter of if, only when. 

Izuku laughed to himself. He would break his bones without hesitation, but he couldn't tell a girl how he felt.

Two situations he didn't know how to fix.

"Hey, c'mon up!" Izuku heard Kyouka from up the stairs and quickly bounded up to the second floor. He entered Kyouka's room to see her dressed black sweatpants and a deep blue shirt. Her hair was shiny and wavy, still damp from her shower.

Why did Izuku find wet hair attractive? He didn't feel like finding out and punched his chest to stop the pleasant bubbling at the sight of it. He took his seat next to Kyouka on the piano bench, doing his best to erase all previous thoughts from his mind.

**(5 Minutes Later)**

"Alright, just repeat my movements. Just the first verse. We're just going to repeat it for a bit." Kyouka began playing the piano while Izuku watched in awe. He still couldn't get over just how beautiful her voice was. *"**Open up your mind, and let me step insiiide~. Rest your weary head, and let your heart deciiide~. It's so eaaasy~. When you know the rules. It's so eaaasy~. All you have to do is fall in love. Play the game. Everybody play the gaaaaame of love. Yeah~.* Okay? Sing those lyrics in your head as you go along. It'll help you keep the rhythm."

Izuku nodded and began playing the song. He was doing well, but some notes sounded off. He furrowed his brow. "I'm sure I'm pressing the right keys."

Kyouka nodded, leaning him back as she pointed at the pedals of the piano, "You are. But, you're far too focused on the arms. You already have the notes and movements down fine. You're just forgetting about the pedals and moving with the rhythm. Your entire body is an instrument and you've gotta use it."

"Yeah, okay. I think I-..." Something clicked in Izuku's brain, a fog clearing that should revealed something that seemed so obvious. He froze as Kyouka's words repeated back to him in his head. "C-Can you say that again?"

"Your entire body is an instrument. Even while playing the guitar you're tapping your feet, moving with the beat, singing in your head. Your entire body is part of the process."

 He looked back up to her with wide eyes, "...My entire body is an instrument."

"Uh, yeah. That's what I just said."

"I'm an instrument."

"...Yeah?"

"I'm a piano!"

"...Yeah, okay. Izuku, we're just gonna go to the doctor real quick."

"No, no! You don't get it." Izuku stood up and began pacing around the room. "I've been too focused on my arms this whole time. All Might isn't super slow but strong. His entire body is enhanced. I need to use my entire body!"

"You're losing me, Broccoli Boy. What's All Might have to do with this?"

Izuku whipped around to her, "U-Uh, nothing! I-I meant that I base how I fight off of him. I'm talking about my quirk! I've been moving all of my power into my arms, when I should be using my entire body!"

Kyouka watched as her friend began to glow with reddish-pink lightning racing across his skin. She had never seen him use his quirk before, and she had to admit that she was really interested. Who wouldn't want to see a quirk with the ability to destroy a giant robot in a single hit? *But*, just not in her room.

"Whoa, big guy! I like my house still standing." Suddenly, Izuku's skin flickered as the lightning turned green, arcing around his body. "...Is it supposed to do that?"

"I think so?"

"Think?"

"I've never done this before."

"Oh boy." Izuku pulled back his fist. "No! Wait a minu-!"

Izuku took the smallest drop of his power that he could, and punched the air. A small gust of wind rushed around the room, waving the curtains and flipping the pages of Kyouka's music book. But, Izuku's arm was completely unharmed. 

"I-...I did it!" 

Kyouka looked at her untouched room in shock, "Holy shit, you did."

"Thank you so much, Kyouka!" The teen was suddenly very close to her, excitement etched across his entire face. 

"Wh-...Why are you thanking me?"

"I wouldn't have figured this out without you! You really did help me with my quirk! You're amazing!"

Kyouka thought Izuku was incredible. One of the most incredible people she had ever met. Probably *the* most incredible. But, damn he was an enigma to her. Here he was, solving his problem with his quirk. He finally figured out how to stop breaking his bones…

...And, yet he was thanking *her. Complimenting her.*

Even after his great achievement, she was what he directed his spotlight on. She thought back to his notebook and his drawing. How he drew her, how he thought she was capable of so much. He helped her, and somehow, she helped him with something even he couldn't figure out.

Izuku just made everything better.

Kyouka smiled warmly, putting her arms around Izuku and placing her head on his chest. "Thanks, Izuku."
