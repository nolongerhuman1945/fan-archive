“Truthfully,” Snape reported, “I am still unsure what Crouch intended to achieve with our discussion, but we concluded that he is in favour of Slughorn’s experiments and I am not. The only meagre connection I can deduce is that Errafet feathers are a key component in the Draught that currently has the elf and the Summers woman comatose.”

Sirius let his gaze roam around the room to gauge the reaction of the others in the War Council to Snape’s report.

In the enlarged mirror on the wall, the English participants had varying expressions: Snape appeared unflustered, Albus looked pensive and puzzled. Moody, lurking in the background, was frowning along with Amelia and an anxious looking Cornelius while Bertie was literally scratching his head.

Sirius glanced at Remus and Harry beside him in the study at Black Farm. Remus was concerned and Harry, thoughtful.

Sirius cocked his head at his son.

Harry cleared his throat. “I have, um, three theories: one, he’s really just bored and wanted to talk to someone other than Wormtail…”

“A distinct possibility.” Sirius muttered.

Harry’s lips quirked upwards for a brief second. “Two, he’s decided to abandon his strategy of needling Snape and instead form a closer relationship trying to lull him into a false sense of security from which Crouch can attack easier.”

“Professor Snape, Harry.” Albus admonished absently.

“But another valid theory.” Moody acknowledged gruffly.

“Three, he’s yanking our chains and hoping we send hours chasing our tails trying to work out whether there’s meaning to what he’s discussed with *Professor* Snape.” Harry concluded.

“You may be right.” Bertie said with a laugh. “It’s a bit like prophecies. We can take any normal every-day discussion and find hidden meaning that would divert and distract us.”

“As much as it pains me to say it, I believe Potter may have deduced Crouch’s possible motivations correctly.” Snape said tersely.

Sirius felt his shoulders tense at Snape’s hidden jibe at Harry but he shook it off. “That’s good thinking, Harry.” He said simply and watched happily as Harry brightened with the praise. “And any of the three or even a combination of them might be at work.” He looked back through the mirror. “It probably goes without saying, Snape, but you need to stay sharp around him and when you’re alone at this mysterious location.”

Snape raised an eyebrow. “I plan to do nothing less.” He admitted.

“Where was this possible location anyway?” asked Amelia.

“The pub was in Little Hangleton.” Snape said. “As for the actual location of the place where I am to make the potion…I literally cannot say.”

“Such is the magic of the Fidelius charm.” Albus said. “We all know the location but it is now hidden from our memories by magic.”

“At least we know the general location.” Amelia said. “Little Hangleton corresponds with the location of two of our monitoring wards even if one of them doesn’t know what it’s monitoring any longer.”

“It is a fascinating magical reaction…” began Bertie.

“Perhaps a discussion for another day.” Sirius cut in. “Snape, do you think Voldemort is in residence at the place you’re making the potion?”

Snape seemed to consider the question seriously for a long moment before shaking his head. “I do not think so. He would not want to risk revealing such a location to his spy. If I cannot tell Albus something that is preferable than taking the risk of my knowing and having Albus find out.”

Once again, Sirius didn’t envy Snape the fine line he walked in his spying. “Anything else come out of your meeting with Crouch?” They had already covered the Restorative potion for the ritual; the new location; Crouch’s surprising invitation to drinks…

“I believe Crouch is already in place here at Hogwarts as a student.” Snape announced.

Sirius ignored the shocked reactions of the others and focused on Snape. “Why?”

Snape’s shoulders lifted in a light shrug. “A combination of what he didn’t say and what he did. He’s entrenched in a role that won’t allow him to make the potion that is certain. The timing of the meeting coinciding with the Hogsmeade outing for the students.” His lips twitched. “We also returned in time for the curfew.”

“He doesn’t want to draw attention to himself by being late or missing.” Amelia concluded grimly.

“Indeed.” Snape confirmed.

Sirius glanced over to Moody. “And you definitely didn’t see him on the map before the end of term?”

“The map didn’t show someone else’s name appearing for someone right in front of me.” Moody confirmed. “All the students checked out.”

“So either Wormtail does know some way around the map,” Remus broke in, “or Crouch realised the danger somehow and just had the student he’s pretending to be remain in place all of last term.”

“We cannot assume he’s taken the place of a male student.” Snape murmured. “He is surprisingly comfortable in pretending to be female.”

“Well, that’s more information than I ever wanted to know about him.” Sirius sighed.

“We have to assume we have a security breech at Hogwarts.” Moody said brusquely. “That Crouch has infiltrated us.”

“We’re definitely not going to be able to do identity checks on the students?” asked Sirius, turning to Albus.

“As you know the Board of Governors has rejected the proposal as unnecessary. Without definitive proof…” Albus shook his head in sombre negation.

“Well, we know who it’s most likely to be.” Moody pointed out. “It has to be one of the students in the castle right now. We need to keep an eye out of strange behaviour.”

“It’s exam time and they are teenagers.” Snape pointed out. “Strange behaviour is normal.”

Moody glared at him. “Constant vigilance.”  

“We’ll take another look at the map.” Remus jumped in.

“We have another problem.” Amelia pointed out. “They were reported to have a vanishing cabinet on the Durmstrang ship linked to one at Riddle’s location. We didn’t find either in the two raids. If they moved the vanishing cabinet inside Hogwarts…”

“Then the bastard has a way in through the wards.” Moody swore.

Cornelius stared a little at the old auror before shaking himself. “Perhaps a search for the vanishing cabinet in the dorms? He must be keeping it somewhere close by and private to himself if he’s using it to maintain contact with…with Riddle.”

“Good idea, Cornelius.” Amelia brightened. She turned to Albus and Moody. “A room by room search for suspected contraband after the Easter return is within your prerogative, isn’t it, Albus?”

“It is indeed.” Albus murmured with a twinkle in his eye.

“It would be good to get this done now the Treasure Hunt is done except for the snake.” Sirius said firmly. “If we can identify Crouch in Hogwarts, secure the vanishing cabinet…if we can work out where it goes we can raid Riddle and get this over with before the third task.”

“I would be surprised if Crouch hasn’t already taken measures to protect the cabinet.” Snape pointed out.

“Maybe he has, maybe he hasn’t.” Moody said. “We’ll soon find out.”

“Talking of the third task,” Sirius said, “do you have an update you can share with us with Harry present?”

“I believe so.” Albus said. “It is not unknown to any of the champions that the final task will take place in the maze currently being cultivated on the Quidditch pitch.”

Harry looked disgusted again and Sirius hid a smile.

“The task was altered by Tom to be more dangerous than we had planned but the basis of the task remains the same. All of our preparations are underway and we are keeping a tight control on security given the previous sabotage.” Albus confirmed.

“Certainly no kids are getting close to the maze and we’ve got the other parts of the task on lockdown elsewhere.” Moody added.

“It would be good if we can end this before the third task.” Sirius stated plainly.

“If we don’t find Crouch and Voldemort,” Harry said, leaning forward, “then he has to grab me on that night. He has to know that apart from the time that I’m in the maze that I’m going to be well protected. What’s the potential for me to be grabbed and taken somewhere else while I’m in the maze?”

“Unfortunately, there is opportunity for any of the champions to be kidnapped during the maze task. We have observation mirrors we are constructing to ensure the watching audience can see the progress of the champions but…the portkey ward will be down as it is anticipated that the winner upon getting to the prize is whisked out of the centre of the maze and to the podium. It was always the plan.”

“So all they have to do is get a portkey on Harry somehow.” Sirius rubbed his head. He’d always known the tournament was a stupid, stupid idea.

“It won’t be easy.” Moody assured them. “We can check everything going into the maze.”

“I agree with Sirius; we need to find Riddle before the third task.” Amelia said crisply. “That should be our focus with the diadem found.”

“We should have a plan though.” Harry said pushing his glasses up. “If we don’t find Tom then the likelihood is that he will make an attempt to grab me at the third task and we need to decide if we let that happen and use it, or try to avoid it.”

Amelia nodded.

“It’s a good point.” Bertie said. “We should plan for the worst.”

Sirius gave a nod. “Let’s put it on the agenda for when we’re back in England after Easter.” He gazed around them. “We’re in good shape. We’ve closed Voldemort down politically and financially; we’ve handled almost all the items that kept him immortal with the exception of the snake; we know who he hasn’t involved in his resurrection plans and who he has. We just need to find him.”

“Do you think there’s a possibility the Carrows or Greyback will know his location?” asked Amelia.

Sirius looked over at Remus wanting a second opinion.

“The Carrows? No. Everything suggests he’s using them because of their local knowledge to target the wedding.” Remus said. “I doubt they’ve had a face to face since the announcement of the wedding broke. Greyback, on the other hand…” he shrugged, “by all reports he’s out of favour. If he knew prior to the attacks on the alliance, I doubt he knows *now*.”

“I agree.” Snape concurred, the mirror rippling at his movement. “The Dark Lord will only have shared his location with as few as possible while he remains physically diminished.”

“Presumably, it would be best to capture the Carrows and determine for certain?” suggested Albus evenly.

“I agree with Snape and Remus,” Sirius paused, not quite believing he’d agreed with Snape of all people before shaking himself and carrying on, “I doubt the Carrows will know anything,” he said, “as for Greyback…”

“If Greyback or I meet before he is captured, one of us will be dead at the end of the confrontation. It will be a fight to the death as required by pack law.” Remus stated unequivocally.

Albus sent Remus a disappointed look but the others looked understanding. Cornelius looked slightly appalled.

“We’ve come up with a rather ingenious plan to keep everyone safe.” Sirius said, understanding why Cornelius looked so disturbed. “Remus?”

Only the Marauders had seen that particular grin on Remus’s face before and Sirius sat back as Remus took the War Council through the plan for the wedding. Really, Moony was the best prankster of them all.

o-O-o

Harry frowned and tried to pat his hair down for the umpteenth time. He was fully dressed for the wedding; open robes in a rich red revealed grey pinstripe trousers, a crisp pale grey cotton shirt open at the neck, and a tight waistcoat of the palest grey silk embroidered with gold brocade thread in patterns that drew the form of wolves howling to the moon. Black boots finished the outfit, polished by the house elves to a fine gleam.  

Sirius appeared in the mirror, leaning forward in the open doorway with a sympathetic expression. “Hair?”

“It’s doing its own thing again.” Harry complained.

Sirius waved his wand at it and the hair settled down into something approximating tidy. Harry turned around with a grateful smile. Sirius wore a matching outfit to his own; his hair neatly pulled back into a ponytail at the nape of his neck.

“How’s Remus?” asked Harry as they exited the bathroom and headed for the Master suite.

“Good. Calmer than your Dad was anyway.” Sirius smiled sadly. He knocked on the door of the Master bedroom and entered without waiting for a reply.

Remus glanced away from the window where he stood gazing out at the early morning dawn, the first rays of light brightening the horizon. He was also wearing a matching outfit to Sirius and Harry but his waistcoat was also threaded through with red among the gold.

“You look good, Moony.” Harry said warmly.

Remus smiled at him, his brown eyes shining happily. “So do you.” He brushed a hand over his cleanly shaven face, his fingers grazing the faint scars of his lycanthropy. “Shall we head out?”

The three of them walked through the Farm, ignoring the bustle of the rest of the pack and the arriving guests, and out to the small rose garden behind the house. Somehow the flowers had been coaxed into blooming and their heady scent filled the morning air.

The garden was a square segmented by a gravel path into four segments with an arbour in the centre. It was a perfect venue for a wedding with white seats arranged in all four quarters with a good view of the arbour. There was a slight mist rising up from the grass which gave the place an ethereal look as night gave way to morning in the East.  

“It’s amazing what they’ve been able to do.” Remus murmured.

“Hilde is a force of nature.” Sirius said with a smirk.

Harry nodded. Remus’s plan to move the time and venue of the real wedding had caused a flurry of panic from everyone but Sirius and, surprisingly, Tonks. The bride had hooted with laughter, hugged her groom and said she’d marry him anywhere and when he wanted.

A throat cleared behind them and Harry turned to greet Simeon. The Regent Apparent to the House of Black wore a variation of their outfit with the same grey shirt and trousers but black robes and silver embroidery on the waistcoat, the House colours.

“Nipper’s down for the count and the elves are looking after him. Anna’s in with Nymphie.” Simeon said clapping his hands together. “Cissy’s told me to get myself over to the portkey arrival point since we’re expecting the first in the next five minutes or so that’s where I’ll be. I’ve been told to remind you to take your places.”

The Malfoys and Simeon would greet the guests before handing them off to Clara and Patrick who would show them through to the garden and their seats.

Simeon held out his hand for Remus to shake. “You look good for a man about to be condemned to a life with a ball and chain.” He joked.

“I feel good.” Remus said. “Dora’s lovely and I’m a lucky man.”

Harry smiled at the genuine sincerity that coated Remus’s words and he saw Sirius’s shoulder drop an inch as though he’d breathed out in relief.

“See you on the other side.” Simeon said. He grinned and with a wave wandered away.

Sirius pointed at the formal entrance to the garden where they’d form a presentation line. “Shall we?”

The next hour flew by.

The Bulgarian Minister who was presiding over the ceremony was the first to arrive, his wife heading to the house to help Tonks. The Ministers from Ireland and France were next, and the Heads of the Werewolf Packs followed. Harry felt Sirius’s hand on his shoulder occasionally providing reassurance and support as they welcomed their honoured guests to the wedding.

The War Council arrived shortly after that; Cornelius resplendent in formal Ministerial robes and his wife in a wonderful cream and lemon outfit. Amelia was with Brian and the two wore matching shades of blue. Bertie was also in his formal Unspeakable robes which gave him an air of authority that destroyed his usual aura of absent-minded professor. The Headmaster’s outfit was a wonderful Hufflepuff yellow with red poppies blooming around the hems, petals rimmed in gold, with black centres and stalks; it was an interesting marriage of Hufflepuff and Gryffindor and Harry was impressed he’d tried to incorporate the school houses of both the bride and the groom in the outfit.

Harry brightened when the next swathe of guests was the Potter alliance. Neville and his grandmother led the way in formal blue and grey, the crests of the Longbottom house proudly displayed, Blaise Zabini with them in his own neat outfit of shades of grey. The Greengrasses arrived with both Daphne and Astoria in stunning lilac outfits that made their blue eyes almost violet. The Abbots and the rest of the Bones family arrived together and Harry noticed Hannah and Neville exchanging nervous looks across the seating area. He wondered what had happened. Nora Zabini arrived before he could contemplate it further, so much cleavage on show in the blue dress that Harry worried she’d catch cold in the chilly Bulgarian air, barely pausing to greet her son before she took her seat.  Other allies and supporters arrived such as the Notts and the Wenlocks who were in service – and time seemed to blur for Harry after that until the Weasleys arrived; Bill escorting a beautiful looking Caro in a soft pale yellow, Arthur without Molly but cheerful and bright-eyed.

The Pack came next; every wolf at the sanctuary neatly dressed in clothing Remus had insisted upon buying for them for the occasion of his wedding, knowing many of them didn’t have good robes to wear. Harry and Sirius greeted all of them warmly including a subdued Sian.

Tonks’ friends from school and the aurors followed, Moody heading up the charge. Harry was impressed by the array of medals his Defence Professor had attached to the chest of his ill-fitting formal robes. Harry’s smile became a touch fixed as many of the young women simpered at either Sirius or himself.

“Buck up.” Sirius whispered as another giggling brunette was led away with a wink by Remus’s beta Patrick. “Almost done.”

The press arrived then; the Lovegoods – a beaming Luna in summery green, followed by Rita Skeeter and the international press in the form of Esmerelda Goose. They were escorted to seats set off at the side in a small press area near to the dignitaries.

Harry glanced over at the full garden and back at the sun, low in the sky. It was almost seven o’clock. Remus and Tonks would marry at seven o’clock and seven minutes.

The first signs that the wedding was imminent was the music striking up in the background – violins and a harp playing a muted classical tune. Hilde hurried over to say hello before rushing to her seat. Her husband took his place in the arbour.

Minerva and the Grangers appeared. The Grangers wore wizarding open robes of the same grey as the trousers and shirts of the wedding party over a sharp grey suit in Wallace’s case and a beautiful cream dress in Miriam’s. They wore red roses rimmed with gold on their lapels. Minnie wore a formal robe, high necked and long-sleeved in the same grey; tight in the bodice with a sweeping skirt, and there was another red and gold rose pinned over her right breast.

Next to arrive was the Malfoys. Narcissa looked beautiful; her pale grey dress with its high waist skimmed the baby bump she had, and was covered in the same silver embroidery as the waistcoats of the men with her. She had eschewed formal robes and instead had a black fur stole. Harry had the awful suspicion it was real fur but decided not to ask. Lucius and Draco all wore matching outfits to Simeon.

The mother of the bride was escorted by Simeon. Andy looked stunning in the same shade of grey and silver as Narcissa but it was a different style; more formal with its high neckline and long sleeves. There was a warm maroon wool shawl that she wore draped over her arms.

“Right,” Sirius said, “we should take our places.” He ushered them down to the arbour at a sedate pace.

Harry settled into his place by Sirius’s side. Sirius stood next to a calm Remus who exchanged a grin with Bogdan as the music changed and the traditional wedding march began.

All their guests rose to their feet.

Hermione was the first down the pathway. Harry’s breath caught in his throat. He had thought she looked beautiful the night of the Yule ball but now…

Her hair was up in some complicated do with tendrils falling around her face. The rich maroon of the shawl around her shoulders set off her colouring, warming her complexion. The pale grey dress had a tight bodice and flared at the hips, falling to the ground. It was embroidered with the same silver as Narcissa’s and Andy’s dresses. Strappy silver shoes completed the outfit and Harry wondered how she walked in them on the gravel. The Black diamonds glinted at her ears and throat, and she carried a bouquet of silver and cream roses. She arrived in her place opposite Harry in the arbour and smiled at him tremulously.

Harry smiled back at her.

Anna was next in an outfit that matched Hermione’s almost exactly. Harry noticed she exchanged a wide grin with Simeon as she passed her husband. Anna took her place opposite Sirius.

Finally, Tonks began the walk down the pathway, her hand tucked into the crook of her father’s arm. Ted was dressed similarly to the rest of the men from the house of Black; black robes, the same grey trousers and shirt, but he had a maroon cravat tucked into the open neck of the shirt.

Tonks was a beautiful bride. She smiled happily at everyone she passed, almost glowing with an inner radiance and in her natural form; her distinctive Black features enhanced by a creamy complexion and her natural silvery-grey eyes; her hair was styled up leaving her long neck bare and elegant. Her dress was a fall of silver so pale it almost was white. It was draped in a fashion that Harry had seen in his history books in primary school in Ancient Greece. One shoulder was left bare while the other had a thick strap that draped down tightly around her bust before falling in pleats from just under the bust to the floor. A maroon silk shawl shot through with the same silver thread was draped around her lower arms. She carried a mixed bouquet that combined all the colours of the wedding; gold, red, silver, cream and grey.    

Ted delivered into the arbour and once Tonks had handed off her bouquet to Anna, he placed her hand into Remus’s with a watery smile.

Bogdan cleared his throat. “The time is seven minutes past seven on the seventeenth day of this wondrous April month. We are gathered here to celebrate the union of this wizard and witch in a traditional hand-fasting…”

Harry felt a lump gather in his throat as Tonks smiled happily at Remus and Remus smiled warmly back at her, his fingers rubbing the back of her knuckles as though soothing her.

“Remus, your vows if you please.”

Remus cleared his throat. “When I was a child I used to think my parents were a fairy-tale prince and princess living happily ever after. They loved each other, respected each other, and together they faced the best and worst of their lives. That’s the marriage I’ve always wanted at heart and I promise you that I will endeavour every day to love you, respect you and stand beside you whatever our lives together bring.”

Tonks was beaming as Bogdan prompted for her to begin. “When I was a child my mother used to tell me the story of how she met my father and fell in love; how he was everything her family hated and so they had to run away so they could live happily ever after. I admired my mother for having the strength to follow her heart, my father for never giving up on the idea of them, and both of them together for working every day to bridge the differences between them with love. That’s the marriage I’ve always wanted at heart and I promise you that I will endeavour every day to love you with all my heart, to never give up on you, and to work with you to overcome whatever challenges our pack may face.”

There was a faint murmur that broke out at the last but Harry could see that Remus’s pack were pleased at the inclusion.

Bogdan waved his wand and a stream of gold magic wrapped around their hands. “You have each made vows to the other. Repeat after me; I vow to magic to take thee as my love, my heart, my soul; to cherish and honour thee; to walk with your hand in mine always; to never break the thread that binds us.”

Harry almost held his breath as Remus and Tonks repeated the vow.

Bogdan smiled brightly. “It is my very great honour to ask you all to welcome Remus and Dora Lupin.” His eyes were sparkling as he leaned into Remus. “You may kiss your bride.”

Harry cheered along with everyone else as Remus tenderly kissed Tonks for a long minute, their hands still clasped together.

Bogdan cleared his throat as the cheers settled down and some of the guests dabbed handkerchiefs at the corners of their eyes. “If I may ask Lord Black and his Heir to come forward for the next part…”

Harry followed as he and Sirius exchanged places with Bogdan, the Bulgarian Minister moving out of the arbour to a seat next to his wife.

Sirius waved his wand and a pedestal appeared with the Black ritual bowl and knife.

Remus and Tonks turned to face them again, happy smiles on both their faces.

Sirius tapped the bowl with his wand. “Familius magicus.” Silver mist rose from the bowl and there was a stir in the audience from those who had never witnessed family magic before.

Harry leaned over and tapped the bowl with his wand. “Familius magicus.” Gold mist joined the silver, the two clouds twirling around each other, weaving in and out.

Sirius cut his palm and let the blood drip into the bowl. “I, Sirius Orion Black, head of the House of Black declare my brother by heart, Remus John Lupin, a son of the House of Black by law, my magic, and by this oath. So have I sworn; so mote it be.”  

Remus took the knife and made his own careful incision. “I, Remus John Lupin, Alpha to my pack, son of the Lupin family, son of the House of Black, accept my place and the duties it entails by blood, by magic and by this oath. So have I sworn; so mote it be.”

Remus cast a cleaning spell at the knife and Harry took it from him. He sliced his own palm carefully. “I, Harry James Potter, head of the House of Potter, Heir to the House of Black have stood witness to these oaths and welcome Remus John Lupin into the House of Black. May your marriage to the daughter of our House, Nymphadora, be blessed. So have I sworn; so mote it be.”

The mist rose from the bowl and formed the family totems; a gold griffin and a silver snake. Harry was pleased that the Wenlock vulture had remained dormant. The snake hissed out a blessing and Harry’s eyes widened.

Sirius glanced at him questioningly.

Harry cleared his throat. “Our family magic welcomes Alpha Lupin and his pack.”

Another murmur through the crowd but Harry saw the pack members all looking pleased and Remus was beaming.

Sirius healed Harry’s palm while Tonks did the same for Remus. The bowl and knife were magicked away again and Sirius cleared his throat.

“With the formalities out of the way, may we all be upstanding for the procession of the bride and groom.”

And with that the music began again and a smiling Remus and Tonks, who took back her bouquet, stepped down from the arbour, making their way hand in hand down the pathway as the guests threw rose petals over them.

The wedding ceremony was over.

It was time for the rest of the plan.

o-O-o

Remus lifted his wand and the time hung in the air beside him.

It was almost three o’clock, the original time of the wedding.

The Ministerial residence was a grand place. Two hundred years old, the building’s ornate architecture reminded Remus of fairy-tale castles. The residence was set at the base of a mountain, woodland all around and only one main road in and out. The main point of entry was usually the floo, but it was locked down and anti-portkey wards had been set as part of the security measures.

Remus tapped his foot impatiently. He stood in the original marquee for the wedding, erected in the large lower garden of the residence that backed onto a stream and beyond that the forest. Gregor’s pack and his own were patrolling the perimeter as they would have been in the original plan. Some of the members from Robert’s, Giovanni’s and Otto’s packs were polyjuiced up as various wedding guests and in their places. It was an all werewolf affair to ensure nobody else was at risk from injury or infection.

The ambush was set.

Remus thought longingly of the Black Farm. The most important people in his life were there. Dora and the baby came to mind first, almost surprising him. She had looked radiant that morning in her natural form; a beautiful bride, happy and joyous on her wedding day. He still didn’t think he deserved her but he was the man she had chosen and he swore to himself that he would be worthy of her, to fulfil the vows he had taken.

And then there was the baby. The tiny scrap of life that Dora nurtured within her. The fluttery feel of his son moving against her skin under his hand was sharp in Remus’s memory. He had a son, not yet born but alive and growing stronger with every day. His own father had been wonderful and Remus promised his son that he would endeavour to be the same; to give the same strong guidance with one hand, and endless love with the other.  

He would protect them with his life.

Harry and Sirius who once would have been the first he thought of were next. Remus smiled sadly. He loved Harry, worried about the weight of the prophecy and the expectations of the wizarding world that lay on the young boy’s shoulders. He would stand beside Harry; protect him as he had sworn to Prongs so many years before.

He understood more with Dora’s pregnancy, Prongs’ faint panic at becoming a father, the sheer bewildering joy that had painted James Potter’s face that day he’d broken the news Lily was pregnant to Remus and Sirius.

Sirius…

In truth, Remus had always felt closer to the other members of the Marauders. Sirius had been too reckless and wild for Remus in his younger years. Remus had been too shy, too aware of his lycanthropy, and too needful to be steady and safe for a friendship with Sirius to be wise. Yet, James Potter had pulled them together and Remus had found joy in mischief, acceptance in their willing friendship with a werewolf, and had seen the abused boy Sirius hid behind the mask of a pureblood rebel; had softened towards him because of that. The whole incident with Snape had damaged the trust between them but in hindsight Remus knew he’d always felt slightly outside of the bubble that Sirius and James occupied. Still, all the Marauders had been brothers once…and now Sirius was his brother and his closest friend beyond any question.

In some ways he wished Sirius was standing beside him but it felt right that Sirius was back at the Farm guarding the people who were most precious to Remus. He had no doubt that Sirius would die before he would let harm come to any of them.

It would be over one way or another that day. Either Greyback or he would walk away from the fight that was coming.

Remus was determined it would be him.

Beside him, Tomas who was masquerading as Sirius scented the air. “They’re coming.”

Remus nodded. His eyes flashed amber. He was ready.

o-O-o

Harry sat tensely in the chair in front of Remus’s desk and glanced at the empty chair behind it worriedly. Behind him, the chink of teacups in saucers broke the silence. Why had anyone thought tea was the solution to their restlessness?

“He’ll be fine.” Sirius said from his position by the fire. He stood leaning against the mantelpiece, his gaze on an old photo of Remus with himself and Harry’s father. The rest of the family sat in the small seating area around the fire.

Minerva had taken one high-backed armchair; Andy and Ted took up one sofa along with a fidgeting Tonks; the Grangers took up another, and Narcissa had claimed the remaining armchair. Caro sat in the other visitor’s chair with Bill perched on an arm. Simeon and Anna had excused themselves for a nap earlier, the time lag between Europe and Australia hitting them hard.

The rest of the wedding guests had been transported to various different accommodations around Bulgaria to rest before the wedding ball that evening at the Ministry. Lucius and Draco had gone with the Notts to their apartment in Sophia. The Potter alliance had been the last to leave with Neville and his grandmother offering to stay behind regardless. The War Council were at the Ministry with the Bulgarian Minister awaiting news of the showdown between Remus and Greyback.    

Tonks leapt to her feet and started to pace. “We should be helping Remus instead of just sitting here waiting for news!”

“We’d be in the way.” Sirius said before anyone else in the room could reply. He straightened. “You think I’m happy that he’s facing off against Greyback without me? No. But I know he’s right that we’d be nothing but a distraction. We’re safe here. He’s got the majority of his pack with him and the majority of the other packs are supporting him. Remus knows what he’s doing.”

Tonks threw him a heated look and stomped off, slamming the study door shut behind her.

Harry winced and rubbed his head.

Andy rose gracefully from her seat. “I’ll go and check on her.”

“I’ll come with you.” Narcissa offered.

The two sisters left in a much more subdued manner than Tonks and the tension in the room eased a touch.

“I really wish there’d been a way for this to happen without it having to be today.” Ted said, reaching for his coffee. “It is supposed to be her wedding day.”

“I’m sure if Remus had a choice, he’d have preferred to do it a different day too.” Sirius said tightly.

Ted held up his hand. “I know, Sirius, and I’m not having a go at my new son-in-law, I promise.” He sighed. “It’s just…damned unfortunate it has to be today.”

“Or a blessing.” Wallace spoke up. “If this Greyback is so determined to get to Remus, best that he has the choice of the field they meet on and the advantage.” He motioned with his cup. “And if Remus is successful, Greyback stops being a threat to him and your daughter. They can start their married life without having the bastard hanging over them.”

Ted nodded slowly. “I just hope Remus comes home to Dora.”

“He will.” Sirius said with a brisk certainty that helped ease Harry’s mind more than anything else that had been said. “Remus was always the best planner of the Marauders and he’s planned this down to the fine detail. He’ll come home.” He suddenly cocked his head. “The outer ward has just pinged.”

They all sat up straighter.

Sirius cocked his head and closed his eyes. “Something’s trying to get through the wards.”

Gilby popped in. The elf was frantic, pulling on his ears. “Lord Black!” He squeaked. “Miss Clara says wizards and vampires are at the South wall!”

“Bugger.” Sirius swore and ignored Minnie’s slightly scandalised look. “They must think any emergency portkeys would bring the wedding guests *here*.”

“So they’ve set up a second line of attack.” Wallace said grimly.

“Portkeys now!” Sirius ordered, already moving towards the study door.

Harry didn’t argue; he stood up and reached for the knut in his trouser pocket and muttered the phrase that would whisk him away.

Nothing happened.

Sirius stopped at the door as he realised no-one had disappeared.

“Anti-transportation wards.” He said grimly.

“Andy and Dora…” Ted said urgently, getting to his feet.

The door opened and Clara appeared, breathless and flushed. “There’s another group of wizards and vampires at the North wall.”

Sirius whirled around to Bill and Caro. “Go to the North and see if you can stop them. They’re trying to dismantle the wards.”

“On it.” Bill said.

“Clara, show them the way.” Sirius ordered.

Clara didn’t protest simply turning and leading the way out.

“Right,” Sirius said, “you all stay in this room. I’m going to seal it with family magic and only someone with Black blood will be able to through. You should all be safe. Gilby, get the women and baby Jason down here. Tell Simeon to meet me at the South wall.”

Gilby popped away.

“Sirius…” Harry began before his throat closed up, fear and anxiety bubbling up inside of him.

Sirius swept across the room and pulled him into a rough hug before he dropped a kiss on his forehead. “You protect this room, Harry.” He said firmly. “I promise I’ll be careful.”

Harry nodded and he set his jaw as Sirius walked out.

Hermione hurried to his side and slid her hand into his. “He’ll be OK, Harry.”

Harry hoped so. He’d already experienced losing Sirius once and he didn’t want to go through that again.

o-O-o

The wolf patronus arrived in the tent and gave a low bow. It was from one of the Bulgarian wolves; an auror like Tomas. It signalled the advance of Greyback’s pack – or what the old wolf had been able to cobble together to face Remus. They planned to let them slip in through what would appear to be a hole in the patrols – a couple of young pack members sneaking away for a smoke – but in actuality was the funnel through which Remus was herding them.

Remus waited in the centre of the tent. Tomas stood ready beside him.

Another signal – the violin music changing as though the wedding was about to begin…Greyback was close…

And then the eerie howl as Greyback called the attack…

The tent disappeared with a wave of Remus’s wand. Tomas’s form rippled from Sirius’s into his own – all the polyjuiced guests changing back into their original guises.

Greyback stood twelve feet away from Remus; two dozen werewolves stood in a loose crowd at the back of him. They were all semi-transformed – muzzles and claws and amber eyes. Growls of unhappiness erupted as they realised they’d been tricked into a trap.

Greyback snarled and Remus felt the visceral shiver travel like ice down his spine.

Remus could still remember the nights he’d woken as a child, nightmares of the monster ripping into his shoulder, biting down and splitting the skin; the agony of the burn as the lycanthropy flooded his blood. He remembered the horror of his first transformation; pain and cracking bones, skin that shifted and changed around him; the feeling of wrong, wrong, wrong…

Greyback straightened. He’d always been a tall, broad man; the werewolf had made him more so. His upper body was bare of clothing; covered in the coarse fur of the wolf for all that the form underneath remained a man. His simple rustic pants covered thick powerful legs. His hands were already forming into claw-like shapes, the nails growing. His face was covered in hair, eyes yellow and filled with hatred, his mouth opening to reveal the dripping maw of sharpened teeth.

“Fenrir Greyback.” Remus began, noting that his pack and their allies were closing behind Greyback’s position, forming a strong circle from which none would escape. He didn’t smell vampires but there was one wizard hovering at the back of Greyback’s party; a thin dark haired boy who bore a faint resemblance to the Carrows.

“Lupin.” Greyback growled. “I see you finally decided you’re one of us.”

“I’m a wizard,” Remus corrected coolly, “and I’m the Alpha of my pack. I can be both.”

Greyback’s yellow eyes gleamed as he took in the others standing with him. “Got ourselves a little wolf summit here, then? Otto, Giovanni, Robert, and Gregor. You taking sides finally? Putting your packs on the line over this pup?”

The four Alphas beside him exchanged amused looks.

“When we met Remus we asked for neutrality and he granted it.” Gregor said brightly. “He has kept his word and more, his pack thrives under his guidance and influence. We have seen the British wizarding world change because of the ties he has with humans he considers pack. And so…”

“We have decided not to remain neutral.” Otto said menacingly.

“The followers of your Master have been foiled once in my country already.” Giovanni growled. “They will not be tolerated.”

“In any of our territories.” Gregor added, puffing out his chest.

“We stand beside Alpha Lupin.” Robert bared his teeth. “And should he fail to put you down, one of us will.”

Remus felt his spirit swell with pride and honour. The packs were going to stand beside him and his pack. They were lost to Voldemort.

Gregor smiled. “I get the first go after Remus but I doubt I shall need it.”

Greyback’s face registered faint alarm before it melted away into anger. “I am Alpha!”

“You are not Alpha.” Remus contradicted him sharply. “You haven’t been Alpha since you showed your belly to Voldemort.”

Greyback took an angry step forward but Remus held his ground.

“You’re nothing more than his attack dog.” Remus said heatedly. “An attack dog that needs to be put down.”

“You’re nothing more than a lap dog for a boy.” Greyback shot back.

Remus smiled lazily. If people had a tendency to overlook Peter as a Marauder, they’d had a tendency to underestimate Remus – except for James and Sirius who knew just how dangerous Remus could be when riled. Everyone else though…everyone else saw the flash and sparkle of James’s charisma and the brash flair of Sirius’s drama and they ignored the mild-mannered werewolf standing behind them.

Greyback snarled again, riled by Remus’s calm. “You think they’re safe? Think again. The Dark Lord has people *everywhere*.”

Worry nibbled at Remus because the Carrows weren’t there and neither were the vampires, and they had to be somewhere. And if he were the Dark Lord he’d have thought about where the women and children would be sent in the event of a werewolf attack – the Farm!

He had to get there but before he could do that…

Remus’s eyes narrowed dangerously at the werewolf who’d turned him. “Well, that was a stupid move.” He informed him almost in a conversational tone.

Greyback’s eyes widened at Remus’s response.

Remus bared his own teeth. “Now, I’m going to have to kill you quicker than I’d planned.”

“Arton – NOW!” Greyback yelled.

The boy at the back threw something into the air; a clear vial that spun through the air filled with a purple liquid.

Remus had no idea what it was and no wish to find out. He banished it with a wordless spell and Greyback’s pack froze.

Remus lifted an eyebrow. “Oh. I guess you forgot I was a fully trained wizard?” And with a flick of his wand sent a flurry of silver arrows at them.

The fight was on.

o-O-o

Sirius didn’t bother running to the South gate; he grabbed hold of Simeon and apparated.

He made them appear without a noise – a skill he’d almost forgotten but remembered from his training. They were positioned behind a large tree for cover and had a good view of the gate. They immediately took up familiar stances – they’d both been through the same training even if Sirius’s had been compressed into a boot camp because of a war and Simeon’s had been in Australia.

“Damn.” Simeon said in a low dark tone.

One of the werewolves from Remus’s pack, a middle-aged man with a paunch, was negating the vampire ward by simply inviting the blood-sucking creatures over the gate. There were five of them; head to toe in black clothing that protected their skin from burning in the sunlight. A group of wizards were the other side of the ward, poking at the wards. They couldn’t get through without the express invitation of someone the wards recognised as an authority.

“We take the heads off the vamps,” Sirius murmured as they started to crawl towards the farmhouse, “deal with the wizards.”

Simeon gave a nod.

They moved out from behind the tree in dual apparition; they appeared behind the vamps almost simultaneously causing the creatures to turn.

Sirius yelled the fire-whip spell and sent it flying in a long line. He took out two vampires, their heads rolling onto the ground before their bodies disintegrated into dust. Simeon’s whip had also taken out one which left them one apiece.

The vamps moved fast, running at speed toward them. Sirius held his ground and apparated at the last minute, coming back just behind the vamp that had tried to rush him and decapitating him with an anvil spell. He looked over at Simeon and found two of Remus’s werewolves had taken down the vampire with their bare hands, Sian and another woman whose names Sirius didn’t remember. They held the vampire down while Simeon staked it.

There was a yell from the gate and Sirius made a show of adjusting his clothing as though he had nothing better to do before walking over, his wand out and held firmly.

The werewolf who had betrayed them cowered beside the gate. “Sorry, sorry, but they made me.” He sobbed. Sian and her friend walked over and stood guard over him.

Sirius’s eyes fell on the short stubby wizard at the front of the group of four on the other side of the gate.

“Hiding behind your wards, Black?” Amycus Carrow gave a wheezy laugh. “You had nowhere to hide the last time we met when I peeled you like an apple!”

There was a flash of something in his mind – pain and terror and his skin drawing away from the flesh of his arm in a long ribbon. Sirius shook it away.

“Still kowtowing to the Dark Pillock I see.” Sirius countered. “Really Amycus I would have thought you’d have realised after all the changes I made back home that it would have been infinitely preferable for your lifespan for you to have stayed home with the vampire you’re screwing.”

Amycus simply raised his hand and revealed a small silver object.

Sirius grinned with amusement. “An auror level ward-buster?!” He motioned at Simeon. “Look what he’s got!”

Simeon folded his arms, his wand still out, and smirked alongside Sirius. “Neat.”

Amycus looked slightly taken aback.

“Go ahead and throw it.” Sirius offered brightly. “I always wanted to see the ward defences utilised.”

“This will defeat even the infamous Black wards.” Amycus sneered.

“Sure, sure,” Sirius nodded, “or the ward backlash will blow you and your companions to smithereens. I can’t wait to see.”

Amycus paused as the wizards around him broke into angry mutters.

“Did you never stop to wonder why the Black wards are considered the most dangerous?” Sirius continued. “Why my grandfather retreated behind them and why your pretentious Dark Lord never tried to get to him?”

Amycus lowered the silver ball. “Maybe you are right, Black. Maybe your wards will destroy me if I were to use this. We’ll just have to dismantle them from the inside. Dog!”

The weeping werewolf huddled into himself looked up startled and flinched but he reached into his pocket and Sirius caught the sound of a vial breaking.

Moisture started to seep through the pocket and the werewolf began to writhe.

Sian sniffed and gagged, falling to her knees.

Before long all the werewolves began to shudder and convulse.

“That can’t be good.” Simeon muttered.

Amycus wheezed another laugh. “We win!” He apparated away and his wizards followed.

Sirius watched horrified as the werewolves began to change. “Simeon, get back to the house and warn the others! NOW!”

Simeon apparated away hurriedly.

Sirius shifted into Padfoot just as the man completed the transformation and growled at him. The women had changed too but instead of threatening Sirius, they formed up either side of Padfoot. Sirius thought about the innocent souls in the house behind him and let the Grim take over…

o-O-o

Clara led the way to the North wall at high speed, Bill was grateful he kept up his physical shape because damn; being a werewolf really increased speed. Caro was just behind him.

There was a woman by the wall inviting in vampires dressed head to toe in black to protect them from the sun. A group of witches stood behind them.

The woman was a pack werewolf who Clara clearly recognised because she gave an angry huff. “Nellie!”

Nellie turned around and they could see her face was wet with tears. “I’m sorry!”

Before any of them could do anything else one of the six vampires she’d let through drew a silver dagger and cut Nellie’s throat, almost decapitating her.

“Dear Merlin!” Clara swore.

The witches were chanting something and the small one at the front moved forward…

Through the ward.

The vampire smiled nastily and started to advance.

Bill lifted his wand.

Clara lifted her head and howled, a call to the others…and suddenly she fell to the floor and started to change.

Bill swallowed hard.

Caro shook her head almost in denial. “We have to warn the others!”

They turned and ran; the vampires right behind them.

o-O-o

Remus smacked Greyback with another silver javelin curse and another. He remained constantly moving, never allowing the old werewolf anywhere close to him.

Around him the packs were engaged in tooth and claw fights with Greyback’s raggedy followers.

Greyback howled as he swatted away the silver arrowheads and leaped to avoid the rest. “Coward!” He snarled. “Meet me as a wolf and we’ll see who wins!”

Remus spun around and avoided another slashing grab. “I’m a wizard, Greyback!”

“You think your pack will follow you if you kill me with magic?!”

“I think my pack will follow me because I can protect them with magic!” Remus snapped back. He lifted his wand and sent out a flurry of silver javelin curses – they avoided the werewolves in his own pack and his allies’, darting around bodies and through legs, to score hits against Greyback’s own followers.

A howl of approval echoed across the battleground.

Remus grinned and let the magic sing through him.

o-O-o

Simeon appeared in the study with a crack that had Harry’s wand in his hand fast and quick. He had it pointed at the intruder before he registered it was the Regent Apparent.

Anna gave a small cry and lunged across the room. “Thank Christ you’re back!”

“We have a problem!” Simeon said. “They’ve released some potion into the air that turns the pack into werewolves!”

They all stared at Simeon horrified.

Harry cleared his throat. “We can’t get out and we don’t really want to hurt any our pack.” He glanced around the room. “A werewolf will generally ignore an animagus because they’re just another animal.”

“But not all of us are animagus yet.” Hermione said before her chocolate eyes widened. “But if we were transfigured into objects…”

“That would work for anyone who isn’t pregnant.” Andy said crisply, nodding.

“Human to object transfiguration is difficult though.” Ted objected. “The reversal more so.”

“Just as well you have a Mistress of the art in the house.” Minerva rose from her chair. “The Grangers should go first. They’re non-magical and will be the most difficult.”

“We should split forces.” Harry said. “Those of who can transform should try and lead the wolves away from the others.”

“The Master suite has additional protective wards against werewolves – Remus told me he put them up to ensure Nymphadora was safe on a full moon.” Andy said. “We should get Cissy and Nymphadora up there.”

Tonks bristled. “I can stay down here and fight! I’m a fully trained auror!”

“You’re pregnant!” Andy shot back. “You need to protect the baby!”

“Your mother is right.” Narcissa interceded. “Besides, I know I will value having a fully trained auror protect me.”

Simeon nodded, his arm around his wife. “Come on. Let’s get you up there.”

Anna shook her head. “Jason and I should do the transfiguration. It’s the safest option for him.”

Simeon grimaced but he kissed her and dropped a kiss on his son’s forehead. “Be safe.”

“You too.” Anna watched as Simeon led the two pregnant ladies from the room, Andy and Ted following.

Minerva set to work transfiguring people into books.

“Gilby!” Harry called for the elf who appeared with a pop.

“All of the elves are to remain hidden. Don’t come unless I or Lord Black call you.” Harry instructed.

Gilby looked unhappy but he nodded and popped away.

Harry turned his attention to the transfigurations Minerva was doing but he knew even if he had the power to complete the transfiguration, he didn’t have enough skill to have confidence that he wouldn’t harm anyone.

There was a loud crash and a howl.

Minerva didn’t pause but continued transfiguring Wallace into a book on muggles. She lowered her wand as something hit the closed door with a loud bang.

Hermione inched closer to Harry.

“I won’t have time to transfigure you, Hermione.” Minerva admitted. “I’m almost drained.” She looked incredibly weary.

Harry cast his mind about wildly. He had to protect Hermione! “You have to change, Hermione!”

“I don’t know how!” Hermione said fiercely. “I don’t even know my form!”

Harry turned to her, his eyes blazing with determination. “You know it, Hermione! You know who you are! You just don’t trust what you know!”

Another solid thump against the door had them all jumping.

“I believe Harry is right,” Minerva said urgently, “you can do this, Hermione. Just focus!”

Hermione gripped Harry’s hand tightly in her own for a brief second before she let go and closed her eyes, her brow creased with concentration.

Another bang and the door cracked down the middle…

He glanced over at Minerva who stood ready with her wand. There had to be more he could do to help Hermione…

He raised his hand, his rings shimmering into visibility on his fingers. “Familius magicus protectus!” He called out strongly.

The griffin and the snake surged from the rings and surrounded Hermione in a fine gold and silver mist.

Her eyes popped open and her mouth formed a small ‘o’ shape before she snapped her mouth closed and…

Suddenly there was a beautiful long-haired chocolate brown cat sat where Hermione had stood.

Minerva gave a sigh of relief and changed into her tabby form. She immediately started ushering the younger cat up a height much to Hermione’s displeasure.

Harry debated for all of a second and took flight as Snitch. He wasn’t confident in his wolf form and in a pack it would only cause confusion…

The door splintered and a wolf sprang into the room…

o-O-o

Bill lashed out with his foot and managed to kick one of the vampires away from him. He spun around and managed to use his wand as a stake thrusting it into the second vampire trying to grab him before it could.

He managed to sneak a look at Caro who was fighting hand to hand with moves Bill hadn’t seen before; classy spins and punches, her body arching and somersaulting away from harm, kicks that had meaning and not just there in desperation…

His attention snapped back to his own fight as the vampire he’d kicked away, sprang at him…

He shot a spell at the leaping creature and the vampire went up in flames.

Bill dodged the lurching fiery corpse and threw himself across the clearing to take out the vampire sneaking up behind Caro…

He wrestled it to the ground with brute strength and staked it; the body collapsed to ashes beneath him and he stumbled back to his feet, whirling around to face the next threat…

Caro was bent double catching her breath but they were alone. “Thanks for the save.” She said, lifting her hand.

Bill shrugged, slightly breathless himself. “We need to get back to the house and see to that witch who crept in.”

Caro nodded. “You know Buffy makes taking down a few vamps look so easy but that was bloody hard work.”

“Who?” asked Bill bewildered as they started back to the house.

Caro stopped and looked at him for a moment with wide eyes. “When we get back to England, Bill, you’re coming round for dinner and I’ll introduce you to Buffy.”

“Deal.” Bill said easily.

A howl echoed over the open ground and they both slowed and stopped.

“Was that…?” Caro asked tentatively.

The answer to her question came creeping around the corner of the nearby barn…three werewolves, low to the ground and stalking.

Bill swallowed hard, searching around for anywhere to hide…he tugged on Caro’s arm. “Up the tree! Now!”

They scrambled up the large oak tree behind them; hands and feet slipping and sliding against the rough bark as the werewolves surged forward. Bill dragged Caro up the last few feet and into safety as the wolves reached the bottom of the tree, growling and snarling.

Caro looked up at the afternoon sky still bright with thin sunshine and back down at the wolves. “Remind to kill whoever came up with the ability to turn werewolves into werewolves without the moon.”

“Yeah,” Bill said darkly, “I’ll be right behind you.”

o-O-o

Sirius held the throat of the werewolf in his jaws and heard the whimpering submission. He nicked the skin a touch to make a point and backed off just a touch leaving the shuddering mess of a werewolf huddled into the ground.

The two female wolves sidled up to Sirius and Sian licked his muzzle in obvious approval.

Sirius jerked his head at the werewolf and the two females lowered theirs taking up the guard positions he wanted them to take without a murmur. He had no idea how they’d understood him but he was just grateful that they had. He turned tail and bounded back up to the farm house.

He had others to protect…

o-O-o

The doors of the Master suite blasted inward with a concussive force that sent Simeon spinning into the nearby wall. He hit his head hard and went down for the count. Theodore who’d been right by the doors wasn’t in much better shape; he had been caught by the splinters and was lying injured and bleeding just by the doorway.

Narcissa immediately had her hand in her wand. Perhaps in hindsight she should have gone with Lucius and Draco, she mused, rather than assuming she’d be better resting at the Farm. She noted that Andy had positioned herself in front of her and Dora.

All three women had their wands up and pointed as the stubby form of a witch dressed in head to toe black waddled into the room.

“Alecto.” Narcissa greeted her politely as though they’d encountered each other in the middle of Diagon Alley rather than in the midst of an attack on the Farm.

“Narcissa.” Alecto smiled, her lips curving back to reveal crooked yellowing teeth. With her pale skin dotted with acne and her oily hair scraped back into a bun, Alecto was the most unattractive female Narcissa had ever set eyes on.

Narcissa frowned. “You have to have Black blood to enter the wards on these rooms.”

Alecto shrugged but she had an evil smirk. “Black must have forgotten that he donated some back during the last war. Did you know that there is a nifty Wiccan spell to use it to give the impression of being with child if you drink a man’s blood? Bellatrix told me of it once when we breeched the wards on the MacDougal place.”

Narcissa’s stomach turned. There were days she grieved for Bella and there were days she was glad her sister was gone from the Earth. She lifted an eyebrow. “What is the meaning of this intrusion, Alecto?”

“I’m here on business, Narcissa.” Alecto said. “Nothing personal.” Her beady eyes settled on Dora. “The Dark Lord wants the girl and her spawn.”

Andy bristled beside her. “You’re taking my daughter to that slime over my dead body.”

“And mine.” Dora muttered.

“That can be arranged.” Alecto cackled, wheezy giggles erupting. “Narcissa, why don’t you handle your sister and I will handle the little girl?”

Narcissa raised her eyebrows. “Alecto, you seem to be under a misapprehension.”

Alecto looked befuddled.

“I’m not on your side.” Narcissa spelled it out for the stupid witch. “I am a daughter of the House of Black.”

Alecto flushed red in anger. “Then you’ll die with them too.”

Andy smiled, dangerous in the way only a mother protecting her child could be. “You first.” And she attacked…a purple spell lashing out across the space…

Alecto barely deflected it…

Narcissa followed it with a blasting curse and Dora with a slashing spell…

Alecto dodged the first and stepped into the latter. Her eyes went to the stub of her wand arm which was bleeding profusely; her forearm and hand still clutching the wand lay on the floor. She looked up at them shocked.

“But you…you’re weak.” Alecto protested. “Muggle lovers…” She collapsed onto the floor and reached for her wand with her good hand.

Andy’s wand flickered out again and took off the other arm, sending Alecto the floor in a tumble.

Alecto’s shock-glazed eyes stared up at her.

“We’re daughters of the House of Black.” Andy said frostily. “We’re anything but weak.”

Alecto moaned.

Narcissa smiled, satisfied as Andy and Dora ignored the witch and moved forward to check on the men. She gracefully glided over to Alecto herself.

The witch was semi-unconscious, her bulbous eyes staring out at Narcissa with disbelief. She was breathing shallowly, the bleeding had slowed; immediate medical care would save her. Narcissa spelled Alecto’s nose and mouth shut. The witch’s eyes widened in horror and Narcissa smiled at her. Alecto had dared to threaten the House of Black and would pay the price for her folly.

“Be grateful,” Narcissa whispered in a low voice as Alecto’s body shuddered desperately seeking air, “Bella would have tortured you for hours, but I’ve always favoured putting animals out of their misery sooner rather than later.”

Alecto shuddered once more and went still.

“Cissy!” Andy’s panicked voice broke through Narcissa’s satisfaction. “Ted’s bleeding!”

Narcissa smoothed her hair back and went to save her sister’s husband.

o-O-o

Remus stood over Greyback, splayed on the floor, bleeding from a variety of silver inflicted wounds. Remus had his wand at his temple. “Submit.” He growled.

Greyback snarled but the old werewolf was a survivor and he arched back, revealing his throat.

The urge to kill him was strong; to rip out Greyback’s throat…but Remus was a wizard first and he wrestled the wolf inside back.

Remus shot a rope spell at Greyback, tying him up. He stepped away from the werewolf and called out for Tomas. “I believe he’s wanted in Bulgaria as much as Britain for crimes against wizards and witches.”

“Yes.” Tomas growled.

“He will get a trial and be executed justly.” Gregor said, walking up to join them.

Remus nodded, wiping the sweat off his brow. “I need to get to the Farm.”

“Go.” Gregor said. “We have things under control here.”

Remus looked around and saw that they did have everything under control. All of Greyback’s people were on the ground, hogtied or injured enough to be out for the count.

Patrick hurried over to him. “Remus!”

“We need to gather and get back to the Farm.” Remus ordered briskly.

“Wait!” Patrick said urgently. “That boy – the one who threw the vial. He said the liquid in it would have turned us all to werewolf form!”

“Merde!” Robert snarled, overhearing them.

Remus’s blood ran cold. “The Farm…”

“If they attacked with that potion then the air around the farm is contaminated.” Patrick said. “We could go but if it is and we get tainted with it too.”

If it was contaminated then it meant the werewolves at the Farm were already turned and his pack was attacking his loved ones!

Remus thought wildly, his mind racing. Bloody Greyback! He’d wanted the advantage of being in his werewolf form…wanted the advantage of fighting Remus as a wolf and…

There was an inhuman growl and Greyback lurched upwards, breaking out of the rope bonds, sending them snapping and flying in all directions.

Remus whirled around and sent a slashing spell across his throat; Greyback’s head toppled from his body.

He was dead.

Clearly, Remus thought irritated, Greyback was an old dog incapable of learning new tricks since he hadn’t understood that Remus was always going to react as a wizard first and…

Remus frowned, looked down at his wand and smiled. He stepped over Greyback’s head and motioned at Patrick. “Let’s get to the Farm. I have a plan!”

o-O-o

Harry watched as Hermione smacked the nose of the blond wolf with a paw, scratching its muzzle badly, before she leaped out of the way onto a higher shelf in the study, skidding slightly across the wood.

Minerva gave an approving yowl and jumped to a safe position nearby on the top of the bookshelf.

Harry launched himself off the light fitting and swooped down to the wolf, diving down to get its attention and then darting quick as a snitch out of the way, flying swiftly through the broken study door and –

Down a corridor the young werewolf following him.

Harry sped up, darting through the open back door of the kitchen and into the sunshine.

There was a bark behind him and he increased his altitude just in time to avoid the werewolf’s snapping jaws.

Harry’s tiny heart beat as furiously as his wings as he glanced back.

The young wolf’s tongue hung out of the side of his gaping mouth; he seemed to be almost grinning. And made another leap for Harry.

Harry flew upwards again and around the back of the barn and…almost froze at the sight of Bill and Caro hiding in a tree with three other werewolves at the base; two circling them like sharks while the other stood up on its hind legs, front paws on the tree bark trying to reach them that way.

He was almost so stunned at the sight that another leaping attempt to catch him almost worked.

Harry gave a squawk of surprise and back-pedalled as fast as he could with his wings.

An angry bark sounded to the left of him and Harry got up a height to see a Grim bounding across the grass towards them. He took the young wolf completely by surprise, barrelling into him and putting it on its back quickly.

The youngster immediately submitted.

Padfoot gave a satisfied growl and stood up, facing the other three werewolves who’d turned from the tree to investigate.

They all scarpered, dashing away towards the barn. The young werewolf scrambled to hurry after them, away from the glowering Grim.

The werewolves gone, Harry lowered himself until he could safely change back on the ground. Bill and Caro tumbled out of the tree in a mostly controlled descent as Sirius changed back to human form.

Harry hugged him briefly and Sirius kept an arm around him as they greeted Bill and Caro.

“A witch got through the wards but we took care of four of the vampires.” Bill said breathlessly. “What is up with the werewolves?”

“The potion must be airborne.” Sirius said soberly. “The two I was with at the South gate seemed to understand who I was. They’re standing guard over the werewolf who betrayed us but most of Remus’s pack that were left behind were young – they might not have the same level of control.”

“We had another at the North. A vampire took care of her.” Caro said. “Clara changed but the last we saw of her she was running off another of the vamps.”

“We should get inside.” Sirius said.

“Simeon warned us in time.” Harry said. “Aunt Minnie and Hermione changed into cats and I diverted the wolf. We changed Anna, Jason and Hermione’s parents into books. The others went to the Master suite.”

“Let’s hope they’re still there.” Sirius said with a sigh. “They should be safe enough if Remus’s wards held.”

“You should all change to your animal forms.” Bill pointed out.

Sirius nodded and Harry moved away from him so they could both turn back.

Caro grimaced. “You should do the animagus training, Bill.” A moment later she was a sparrow.

She and Harry flew at the back of Bill, guarding the only one who wasn’t an animagus as he followed Padfoot to the farmhouse.

o-O-o

Sirius transformed back to himself as soon as they entered the study, the wrecked door fixed with a wave of his wand.

Harry changed back and made his way to the bookshelf.

The two cats on the very top shelf meowed at him and the tabby leaped gracefully down to the mantelpiece and then to the floor. The chocolate brown cat Sirius assumed was Hermione clung to the uppermost shelf with every claw she had, and hissed at the coaxing fingers of her boyfriend.

Minerva shifted back in a blur that was seamless. “The situation?”

“Still assessing.” Sirius said grimly. “Werewolves are still werewolves. We have a witch on the loose and a couple of the vampires are unaccounted for. Amycus Carrow left when I convinced him breaking the wards was going to get him killed.”

“He always was a mealy mouthed little slug.” Minerva said tersely.

“Bill and Caro went to check the Master suite; we should get up there.” Sirius said.

“I’ll leave the books here for the time being.” Minerva pointed at the stack on the desk. “They should be safe.”

Sirius nodded. He glanced over to Harry and found him with his arms full of a chocolate cat.

“I don’t think she knows how to turn back.” Harry said worriedly.

It was probably safer for Hermione if she remained a cat in the interim but he didn’t fancy carrying her all the way to the Master suite.

“Perhaps I should stay here with Hermione in my other form. We should be perfectly fine with the door fixed and closed.” Minerva suggested briskly. “You and Harry head up to the Master suite and check on the others.”

Sirius didn’t want to agree but he nodded. “Stay safe.”

Minerva changed back and Harry placed Hermione gently down onto the sofa.

They left the study, closing the door on the two cats inside.

o-O-o

“Woah.” Harry muttered as the remains of the doors to the Master suite came into view. He exchanged an anxious look with Sirius and moved forward.

The dead witch on the floor was the first thing Harry saw and he blanched.

Sirius grabbed him and turned him away from the sight. He glared at somebody over Harry’s shoulder. “A little warning would have been nice.”

“Sorry, but we’ve been a little busy.” Tonks snapped at her cousin.

Harry looked over at the bed. Simeon was stretched out on the near side to the door, a deep purple bruise on his left forehead. Ted was on the other side of the bed by the window, conscious but scratched up pretty badly. Andy was sitting beside him, holding one bandaged hand tenderly. Tonks hovered by her mother’s side.

Narcissa straightened from her examination of Simeon and brushed down her dress. “Simeon needs a healer. His skull is fractured although his brain seems remarkably intact.”

“We need to get that anti-transportation ward they put up down.” Bill said.

Caro waved at herself and Bill. “We can do that.”

Sirius nodded and they left.

“How did Alecto get through the wards?” asked Sirius, ushering Narcissa into a chair.

Harry tried to ignore the body by his feet.

“Something to do with having some of your blood at her disposal and a Wiccan spell Bella had taught her.” Narcissa explained crisply.

“Great.” Sirius said dryly.

Harry opened his mouth to speak but something caught his eye beyond the window – a flash of black…

“Watch out!” he yelled.

The window smashed inward as the vampire sailed through the glass.

Sirius threw himself over Narcissa and Harry ducked down to avoid the glass splinters.

“Snitch now!” Sirius yelled and Harry changed form quickly as the vampire landed beside where he’d been a moment before.

The vampire leaped over to Tonks and made to grab her but Tonks side-stepped and punched him hard sending the vamp scuttling away.

Harry flew up to the light fitting to get out of the way.

Another vampire entered, jumping in through the destroyed window.

Andy hit it on the head with a lamp.

A wolf bounded into the room and landed heavily on the first vampire…

CRACK!

Remus and two others appeared in the middle of the bedroom.

Remus swore and his wand flashed out, decapitating the second vampire who had dodged another ornament Andy had thrown at him and was trying to grab for Tonks. It fell to the ground in a shower of dust.

Tonks gave a happy cry and threw herself at her new husband as the echo of a sickening crunch was heard through the room.

Harry glanced over and told himself he didn’t want to throw up in bird form – the werewolf had ripped out the throat of the vampire.

“Clara!” Remus ordered, the Bubble Head around him quivering with the force of his order. “Move away!”

The werewolf growled but complied, slinking over to sit beside Remus like a recalcitrant house dog.

Sirius made his way across and finished the vampire off – cutting off its head with a simple spell.

The vampire dissolved into ash.

Harry flew down and changed back.

Sirius reached over and tugged him into his side. He gazed in relief at Remus. “Greyback?”

“Dead.” Remus smiled brightly and looked around the room with wide eyes. “Looks like you’ve been having some fun of your own.”

“Fun?” Sirius repeated with an incredulous laugh. “Moony, you have to get out more.”

Harry breathed a sigh of relief as Sirius’s grip tightened around him.

It was over.
