**A/N: A bit of a training arc chapter, but we get to the License Exams at the end**

**I will admit this now, but prepare for plenty of the License Exams to be skipped. Basically anything that's not Izuku and Kyouka, with probably a couple other things**

**This arc is...meh. I'm gonna be making some changes for certain characters. Inasa is getting changed, because Inasa's whole thing in the canon arc is fucking stupid IMO. And Camie/Toga is going to get some more moments (Toga also has something pretty major in this chapter too).**

**HOWEVER, the biggest reason I'm doing this is to interlace the "Lady Nagant Arc" into it as she continues her crusade, which I definitely find more important.**

**There is some art in this chapter, and I know a few people can't see it for some reason. Truly, I don't know why everyone else can see it, but you guys can't. I wish I knew how to fix it, but my Twitter has both images if you can't see them here. I forget if I'm allowed to post links or not, so just look for MizuTori on Twitter.**

**Anyway, if you celebrate it, Happy Thanksgiving!**

**(QUICK WARNING: The first scene of this chapter is a little spicy. We don't actually see anything happen, but it's the before and after. It starts off right where our couple were at the end of last chapter. I just don't know if that bothers anyone even hearing some terms used. It's mostly comedic, but also used for Kyouka's character. Alright, that's it.)**

“...You’re joking.”

“Not even a little bit,” Izuku smiled up at Kyouka. They had been in this position for a while. Kyouka was still straddling him on their bed, her shirt and bra tossed aside. Kyouka’s challenge was still underway, but Izuku’s latest suggestion was confusing to Kyouka, to say the least.

“You’re sure?”

“Yes.”

“...Really?”

“Yes, Kyouka.”

“...A boobjob?”

“You said to prove that they’re the best, and I intend to.”

Kyouka stared down at him blankly, pointing at her chest, “...With these?”

“Kyouka. Yes.”

“...You trying to pull off the impossible or something?”

“It’s definitely not impossible. Like I said, you told me to prove why I think yours are the best. Will you let me?”

Kyouka looked down in disbelief, trying to form some sort of proper retort, but she had to admit he had her mentally pinned here. “...Fine. Get your pants off. But, I reserve the right to tell you ‘I told you so’ when this doesn’t work.”

  
  
  
  
  
  

***…~AMP~...***

  
  
  
  
  

“I can’t believe that worked.”

The couple sat under the covers, looking up at the ceiling as soft music played quietly in the background from Kyouka’s phone. She laid pressed up to Izuku, his arm around her shoulders and an extremely rare smug smile unable to be wiped off his face. 

“Does this mean *I’m* allowed to say ‘I told you so’?”

“Absolutely not,” Kyouka chuckled. “Just take pride in the fact that you banged my boobs, and leave it at that.”

“...Still worked though.”

“Uh-huh. Barely.”

“Didn’t feel that way to me.”

“You weren’t the one trying to push your chest together the whole time.”

“Not trying. Succeeding. Because…”

“It worked…” Kyouka trailed off, nuzzling further into Izuku’s shoulder. “Whatever. Fine, they’re just barely big enough.”

“You saying they’re just barely big enough is far better than you saying they’re too small, which is huge progress. This night is almost a complete success.”

“Almost?”

“W-Well, I mean…I’m the only one that got real pleasure out of that. It’s your turn…” Izuku maneuvered out of the cuddle, lowering himself down Kyouka’s body, trailing small kisses as he went.

Kyouka sighed blissfully, weaving a hand through Izuku’s hair as he got closer to his target, “No objections here.”

The couple went back to the business at hand, ignoring the buzz that came from Izuku’s phone on the bedside table. His Hero News updates had refreshed, breaking news coming through as pictures of downtown Tokyo flashed on the notification thumbnail, the word ‘Corrupt’ blazing across the HPSC building.

**(** **Next Morning: HPSC Tokyo HQ: Committee Boardroom** **)**

  
  
  

“Well, you gotta admit, this is a first,” Aiwa, one of the older suits, grumbled as everyone at the table watched the cleaners on the suspended scaffolding powerwash the building, the fires put out some time ago. “The only problem is this doesn’t seem like the League's MO.”

“Hm…” Madam President nodded in agreement as she stood in front of the window, water streaming down the glass. “It’s unlikely that they would be ready to make a move so soon.”

“Unless it’s a distraction,” a blonde woman shrugged at the end of the table. “Turn our attention elsewhere.”

“On a stunt like this?” Aiwa scoffed. “From Kamino to vandalism? I doubt that. Besides, when has the League ever made any politically inspired moves? They worked with the Hero Killer for a day, and even that’s suspect, not that we can even get the Hero Killer to talk to any government official.”

“Nagant is still in prison?” Madam President asked, immediately silencing the room. “This act, the League going after the guards assigned to her…It’s no coincidence.”

Everyone was quiet. It wasn’t often Tsutsumi’s name was spoken after she painted the head office with the color “Chairman Brains”. 

“...It wasn’t a rhetorical question.”

Aiwa cleared his throat, answering her, “Those guards that claimed the League came into their homes and knocked them out said they woke up at home, not a scratch on them or their families. All of them were on Nagant’s typical movement schedule, and claimed that they were out for a few days at minimum. Yet, somehow, all of them clocked into work. Not to mention Nagant was still in her cell, no changes in behavior, nothing. Her cell was completely searched, no signs of tampering in any way. The cameras were on, but apparently nobody saw anything. By the time the guards reported their interactions with the League, the security cameras at Tartarus had already cycled through and deleted old footage for new footage. Perhaps they got the idea for this little stunt from her, but she’s remained in her cell since the incident.”

“The report from the USJ showed that one of the League villains has the ability to create portals,” Yokumiru added, turning away from the window to face the board, “Are we certain she’s not being taken in and out of Tartarus?”

“They've had guards at her cell twenty-four/seven, checking in at random on the hour, every hour. She’s had her outside time removed, her meals have been strictly in her cell. She’s stayed there, no doubt about it.”

“Mm…If the problem isn’t that she got out, then the problem is the League somehow knows about what she did and her involvement with us. If *anything* about Nagant gets out, we’ve dug our own graves.”

“But, ma’am, I still don’t see how this is the League. If they were trying to shift our focus away from them, why would they make us think they know our secrets? That would make us focus on them even more.”

“...Or, perhaps it’s a warning,” Yokumiru turned back to the window, looking out over the city. “Perhaps, this is their way of telling us to back off, or they’ll tell the world.”

“Seems like a bold gamble, saying that the whole world has every reason to never believe a word they say.”

“Mm. Everything is business as usual. This is a stunt pulled by some extremist. We wait and watch, until they make another move.”

“Not like we have much choice. It seems our worries about Shigaraki were justified.”

**(** **Unknown Location: Abandoned Satellite Base** **)**

  
  
  

“This game is so stupid!” Spinner growled, tossing his (stolen) controller onto the couch as Tomura smiled smugly next to him. “It’s ninety-percent RNG!”

Tomura shrugged, getting up from the couch while taking off his two-fingered gloves, “Sounds like sour grapes to me.”

Magne set down her own (also stolen) controller on the crates they had been using as a coffee table, side-eyeing her boss, “It should be near impossible to have a winning streak at Mario Party.”

“ *Should* be, but you’re talking to a veteran here.” From the corner of Tomura’s eye, he saw Himiko slip out the front door, likely out for another sanguine feast. The only reason he saw her was because she wasn’t trying to hide, but he couldn’t help but notice how easily she glided across the room without anyone noticing. He didn’t even know she had been in the room. Her skips across the room were silent, and it only made him believe Lady Nagant’s suspicions more. 

He was beginning to wish he never had that conversation with her. 

He was also beginning to wish he didn’t have to have this next conversation with Toga.

“You guys can find something else to play. I’ll be back in a sec.” Tomura followed her out, seeing her stroll along the grounds in the shadow of the satellite dish. She had a pint of blood in hand, one of many from the supply they had gotten. 

Sure, it was supposed to go to the sick and needy in hospitals, but they counted as sick and needy people, right? Just sick in the head.

He tried to get info about any brain dead nomu he could use for some blood, but any attempts at contacting the good doctor were futile. 

“Hey,” Tomura called out to her, causing Himiko to turn around and take the spout of the blood bag out of her mouth.

“Yo!”

“We need to talk,” Tomura ignored her greeting, nodding towards the forest. He began heading towards the area where he had caught her with the deer. She skipped along behind him, not a care in the world until they were through the trees and in the clearing. 

Himiko hopped up onto a rock, sitting down and taking another sip of blood, “What’s up? This an important kinda talk?”

“You could say that,” Tomura pocketed his hands, pacing mindlessly across the grass, staring up through the leaves. “...I think there could be a spy.”

Himiko furrowed her brow, peering at him in disbelief. “You’re joking, right?”

“I wish.”

“No, really. I mean, c’mon, who could possibly even be a spy? Twice and Big Sis Mag are absolutely not spies, Dabi is anything but covert, Spinner is obsessed with Stainy, Compress has been a thief for years, and you’ve known Kurogiri since, like, forever. I just don’t see how it’s possible.”

Tomura didn’t answer immediately, and when he did, he didn’t answer directly. “You know, Nagant says you had some tips about HPSC security. How’d you know about that?”

Himiko raised a brow at first, but quickly realized there was one person she had left out of the list. She looked down at her lap, blank expression, taking another sip from her blood bag.

“...I’m wanted, remember?” Himiko looked back, wiping blood from her lips. “I need to learn how to avoid them whenever I can.”

“Mm, true. But, uh, specifically about their building?”

“Most inactive time at the building also means they’re probably not working in the field.”

“In Tokyo?” Shigaraki countered again, his expression unfaltering. “I thought you were from Musutafu.”

“...I-”

“And, actually, let’s go back to your point about being wanted. Giran said you were a suspect for a bunch of murders…funny how you’re not on the news anywhere. No wanted lists either. In fact, outside of the file Giran managed to get his hands on, it’s almost like you don’t even exist. Birth certificate, school records, nothing. You've been a street rat your whole life? Even born on the street? I mean, that’s the only way I can think of that stuff not even existing. Must’ve gotten into a lot of trouble throughout the years to reach your skill level. And, speaking of which, I just gotta know just *how e* xactly you got so good at fighting. Last I checked, you were just some street urchin itching for your next meal half the time. You’re not just good with a knife, you know how to take people down like they’re nothing. You’re beyond a pro. The way you walk around, too. It’s like you glide across the floor, no noise to be made. Kinda like…a trained killer.”

Himiko sat silent, staring at Tomura with an empty look in her eyes. Tomura walked up to her, standing in front of the rock. He leaned in closely, Tomura’s gaze meeting hers through his unruly hair.  

His voice was low and quiet, “...You’re an assassin too, aren’t you?”

All that could be heard was the rustling of thousands of leaves, the wind blowing in both of their ears, and pounding heartbeats. Neither of them could tell whose heart was the loudest. 

“...I was.”

Tomura’s eyes clenched shut, a grimace of what Himiko could only interpret as pain flashed across his face. She could only make guesses, because she was fairly certain she had never seen pain like this on him. 

Betrayal. 

Tomura took a deep breath, nodding his head slowly, “...Okay.”

His hand shot out, reaching around Himiko’s throat in an instant. Himiko reacted faster, her blood bag dropped and a small blade pressed against the base of Tomura’s pinkie finger, keeping his hand from fully enclosing around her throat as he shoved her down onto her back.. 

She pressed another knife against his stomach, but didn’t thrust it into his torso. Tomura grabbed the blade, seemingly ignoring how it sliced his palm, the metal cracking and crumbling under his touch. 

“Give. Me. *One.* One good reason not to kill you.”

“I said I was! Was! I’m…not…with them anymore!” Himiko choked out as Tomura’s hands squeezed her windpipe, her instincts screaming at her to attack back, but she was holding back. “And y-...you haven’t killed me yet. Ac-! My other knife is basically dust already. Which means…you don’t wanna kill me.”

“You’re right. I don’t. Convince me that I don’t *need* to.”

“I could’ve cut off your pinkie multiple times already, but I haven’t. I could’ve killed you all in your sleep multiple times over, but I haven’t.”

“A fair point,” Tomura nodded, his grip growing even tighter, “But, still not good enough.”

“I’m not a spy, and you know it. I just need to explain. You don’t talk about most of your past, and you-Ergh! You expect me to talk about mine?”

“When you used to work for the HPSC? Yeah, I’d say that’s something we’d like to know. So. Start. Talking.”

“...I killed another student,” Himiko didn’t waste any more time, that day replaying in her mind like it was yesterday. “I already told you about how my parents felt about my quirk. I spent years suppressing it, my urges. But, when I was at school, a fight broke out in the courtyard. One of the boys in the fight was bleeding, and I-..the second I saw it drip down his face, I just…I don’t know what happened. I…I couldn’t take it anymore. *I needed it.* I got him alone, and I drained him of all I could, but some other girls came in and saw me. I was covered in his blood, my body starting to transform into him. I ran home, and I hid. I was panicking, I didn’t know what to do or where to go. I just waited for my parents to come home. I heard the door open, and I ran downstairs, but…but they weren’t alone. Someone had already called them and told them what happened.”

Tomura’s grip loosened just a little bit, “Our friendly neighborhood government.”

Himiko didn’t confirm his answer, which still told Tomura what he needed, “Apparently, being able to turn into anyone is something the HPSC found incredibly useful. They told my parents they would make this go away, protect their reputation. All they had to do was hand over their kid; the daughter they already didn’t want anymore. Their freak of a kid, turned murderer. They signed those papers before I could say a word. They took me, kept me locked away, trained me, made me kill for them.”

“Trained you too well, apparently, seeing as you got out. They seem to have a problem with their experiments turning on them.”

A smile slowly grew on Himiko’s face, blood still staining her fangs, “You ever see that movie ‘The Thing’? It’s from centuries ago, but…that’s just what it was like. One-by-one I became my guards, and one-by-one they dropped, drained, and disposed of. They keep my name out of the news because they don’t want anyone to know I exist. I’m another one of their loose threads. How do you catch someone who can be anyone? They’re looking for hay in a haystack. That’s why I like it here, though. I don’t have to hide. So…how’s this gonna end, boss?”

Tomura continued to stare down at her, with Himiko waiting for him to make his next move. But, he released her neck, standing back up to move down from the rock. “I believe you.”

Himiko sat up, rubbing her neck with a cough, “...Thanks.”

Tomura shook his head with a sigh, “I’m sorry, Toga. I jus-”

“I get it,” she stopped him. “Really, I do. Do you really think any of us would let a spy out of here alive?”

“Yeah, well…Look, you don’t gotta say anything now, but the others should know at some point. We’ll just say you told me in private, and we didn’t want to say anything in case of a bad reaction. I’ll see you inside.”

Tomura began walking back towards the base, with Himiko peering at him as he went. She smirked just a little, “I told you that you were nice.”

Tomura stopped, turning around with a brow raised, “I just tried to kill you, and you call me nice?”

“Bah, you wouldn’t have done it,” Himiko waved him off dismissively. “I’ve never seen you kill anyone before.”

“...I’ve taken lives; innocent ones. It’s not the act of killing that makes me hesitate, it’s who I’m trying to kill.”

“Aw, that means you like us.”

Tomura glared at her, until he closed his eyes and sighed, “...Yeah. So what?”

He turned around to walk back to base, with Himiko giggling from her rock.

**(** **UA: Gym Gamma** **)**

  
  

\* **BOOM!!!\***

Katsuki blasted another pillar, growling as it crumbled apart before him. He still hadn’t got his scattershot down, but he was getting close. He looked down from his position atop the concrete playground, frowning down at his other classmates. 

The Dynamic Dipshits hadn’t arrived yet. If you didn’t see one, that meant both weren’t there. He didn’t remember a time where Deku and Earlobes weren’t together, constantly making his life ten times more irritating. 

He shook his head, bits of rubble flinging out from his hair. He still hadn’t been able to get Kamino out of his head, and those two idiots were his only source of information, but there was no way those two would ever talk about it again. Not with him, that is.

They were hiding something. If it had something to do with that Shigaraki guy, why weren’t they telling anybody? If he knew anything about Deku, it was that he was constantly trying to help everybody at all times. It was incredibly annoying, but this time it was supposed to be helpful. 

Fucking bastard, hiding shit. A concept he didn’t think Deku even understood, but apparently he had plenty of secrets, including his mysterious quirk.

No one else here understood why his quirk made no fucking sense, but…it’s not like he could explain to them why it didn’t. That wouldn’t end well for him. Come to think of it, it was a miracle nobody had ever asked *why* he called him Deku…

He grit his teeth, punching his thoughts back down into his subconscious. He didn’t need this bullshit right now. He needed to focus on getting that damn provisional license. 

Katsuki growled, firing off another blast at a chunk of concrete. In his aggression, he didn’t notice All Might spectating his class on the ground level, with the block of scorched and smoking concrete now plummeting towards his teacher. 

Katsuki rushed forward, calling out, “ALL MIGHT!!! LOOK OU-!”

*\*ZWOOM\**

A streak of green light appeared from the gym’s main entrance, smashing straight through the block of concrete, reducing it to nothing but dust and pebbles. Katsuki scowled as he watched the light dissipate, with Deku landing on the ground below.

Izuku landed back down on the ground, brushing off any leftover debris. “You okay, All Might?” 

“Ha! Never better, Young Midoriya. Nice duds.”

![](https://i.postimg.cc/v8psSLDB/Izuku-New-Suit.jpg)

He wore a new suit. His gauntlets were replaced with white, fully braced, rectangular padding on his arms, with matching pauldrons for his shoulders. Each had golden bolts in the corners. The blue stripes that used to be on his gauntlets were replaced with a purple soundwave design. It was a sickeningly sweet homage to his partner, but that certainly wasn’t a bad thing. Running under his arms, down the sides of his torso and to his legs was his original black pattern design, but this time had a gold trim. His red belt was replaced with a black one, also with a golden trim this time. His knuckles had golden padding on them too. The gold was made to match his new belt buckle. Or, technically an old belt buckle. It was Nana’s old one, the one Toshinori had gifted Izuku for his birthday.

He also had face paint crescents like Kyouka’s covering his freckles, his colored violet.

The real new addition were the armored legs. Layered black and gold-trimmed armor covered his legs, with a white stripe running down the center, from the top to his toes

“Duds?” Kyouka’s voice came from behind him, with All Might turning around to find her in a new suit as well. “You’re so old.”

![](https://i.postimg.cc/YqbvWsbV/Kyou-Hamm-Remaster.jpg)

Kyouka’s new leather jacket was short, only reaching her stomach. It had a red striped running up her arms and reaching the matching trim. She had a matching violet soundwave design running across the front of the jacket. She still had her peach colored, ripped-up shirt. Her hand speakers were now attached to gauntlets underneath her sleeves. Protective padding was a good enough excuse. Nobody but Mei knew that it had the same impact-absorption tech from Izuku’s costume. 

Toshinori couldn’t help but smile as his eyes found Kyouka’s new belt, latched loosely around her waist, over her shirt. Shining brightly was her own variation of Nana’s belt design, adding her to the club. Her black pants now had Izuku’s chest pattern running down the sides in white. Again, a sweet homage. Kyouka’s boots had been slimmed down, reaching up to her knees and sectioned off into smaller speakers and buckles, holding a closer resemblance to combat boots, with a red trim on the paneling.

“I may be old…”

Kyouka blinked a couple times, waiting for him to answer, “...And?”

“Nah, that’s it.”

They all chuckled, and Katsuki couldn’t help but glare at them from above. Who else would come to the rescue? A rescue that never would’ve had to happen if he had never gotten kidnapped in the first place…

And, that smile All Might gave them. A smile of fondness, of…pride.

Katsuki growled, blowing away another chunk of concrete as he walked away, further into the concrete structures, “Watch yourself, All Might!”

“Hey!” Kyouka called after him, but Toshinori put his hand up to stop her.

“Just let him go, Young Jirou. He’s right, I’m in no condition to be so close to the action. Hell, I’m technically not even supposed to be back to work yet.”

*“I’m…trying…”* Kyouka’s face was scrunched up, her face going red as every instinct in her body was yelling at her to shout something back at Katsuki. *“Can’t…hold…back…* How is All Might supposed to watch himself when we can’t see past your giant ego!”

Kyouka coughed as she rested her hands on her knees, Izuku rubbing her back, “You almost had it. I’m proud of you.”

“Alright, enough,” Aizawa walked up to them, nodding back towards the entrance. “Problem Child One, you’re in the ‘too dangerous to practice with everyone else’ group. This group is scheduled for the next hour, so head to a different testing ground. There are different teachers in different areas.”

Izuku raised a brow at Kyouka, “Ground Beta?”

“And get PTSD flashbacks from fighting All Might? Eh, sure.” The couple went back towards the entrance of the gym, beginning their trek to the other part of campus. 

“I’ll take over here,” Aizawa told All Might, leaning in and lowering his voice, *“Go take over for Snipe in Ground Beta. I’ll be over soon.”*

Toshinori nodded, “Alright. Sorry about all that, by the way. I wasn’t thinking. I guess I’m still not used to being this vulnerable.”

Aizawa hummed, a shrug of his shoulders, “I suppose it would be a tough transition for anyone to stop catching bullets and bench-pressing mountains for decades.”

“Mountains? Ah, maybe. Just weird not being able to fight back.”

“You’ve done enough fighting. It’s why you have those two,” Aizawa pointed back towards the gate, gesturing to the exiting couple.

“Ah, well I wish they wouldn’t have to fight at all.”  
  

“True, but it’s inevitable. Which is where we come in. Speaking of which, before you go, I’m assuming you saw the news this morning? You think that’s the League?”

“I…I don’t know. It doesn’t fit with what the League has done in the past, but from what Young Midoriya and Jirou said about their meeting with Shigaraki, he seems to keep changing. His goals are still a mystery, but he’s never seemed aimed towards politics.”

“I say it’s a distraction. Now everyone keeps speculating what it was supposed to mean.”

“Or, he knows something, and is trying to scare them.”

Aizawa shrugged, “Every government has its dirty laundry, the HPSC isn’t an exception.”

“...It certainly is not.”

  
  
  
  

***…~AMP~...***

  
  
  
  

**(** **Unknown Musutafu Apartment** **)**

  
  
  

*\*Knock-Knock\**

Kaina swung her door open, finding Tomura and Himiko on the other side, a portal vanishing behind them, “Mm, you remembered to knock this time. What you didn’t seem to remember is-”

“You don’t want to see us. I know. But, my friend Toga has something to say to you. Something that isn’t meant for a hallway conversation. Especially between three highly wanted criminals-”

  
“Just…” Kaina raised her hand, stopping Tomura. She stepped aside, nodding into her apartment, “Come in.”

“Your hospitality knows no bounds,” Tomura chuckled as they stepped inside. All the lights were off, and her blinds were closed. The only light came from her small kitchen area and the TV on the right wall. Kaina shut the door behind them, barely acknowledging their presence as she sat down at her kotatsu, getting back to her plate of tamagoyaki, rice and fruits. The news was on, Kaina’s stunt still the main headline as footage of her burning words looped. “Still the talk of the town.”

Kaina only hummed noncommittally, eating another bite of her food and then waving it at Himiko, “She’s not dead, so I assume it’s not as bad as we thought.”

“Oh, no. You were right. She worked for the HPSC-” 

*\*KRCHK!\**

Kaina’s rifle was out in the blink of an eye, the barrel aimed directly between Himiko’s eyes. Himiko merely smiled brightly at her as Tomura stepped between them, “I said *worked* . Past tense.”

“And she was…” Kaina questioned, her gaze unwavering.

Himiko popped out from behind Tomura’s shoulder, “I was your replacement!”

“...” Kaina’s rifle retracted back into her arm, leaning her crossed arms onto the kotatsu, “How old are you?”

Himiko tilted her head quizzically, “I turned seventeen last month.”

“And you got out when?”

“A few years ago.”

Kaina sighed, shaking her head as she turned back to the TV, “You weren’t my replacement. You were my replacement’s replacement. HPSC wouldn’t dare go without an enforcer for that long. They tricked me into their bullshit right around when you were born. I certainly wasn’t the first, so who the hell knows what happened to the other assassin they had when I was there, or even who it was?”

Himiko went up to the kotatsu and sat down on the side to Kaina’s right, “Then who was your replacement?”

“That’s what I’m gonna find out.” Kaina’s gaze flickered over to Himiko. Her expression remained blank, but she eventually sighed through her nose. “...How’d they get you?”

Himiko’s gold eyes met Kaina’s, taken aback by her sudden interest. Nobody but Tomura had gotten more than a couple passive-aggressive sentences out of her, and even Tomura was saved from the passive-aggressive part. “...I can transform into whoever’s blood I drink, but it gives me vampirism. My parents made me suppress it, but the cravings became too much, I guess. I snapped one day, after seeing some blood, and I killed someone. The HPSC figured my quirk was useful, and gave my parents a deal to make me disappear.”

Kaina scoffed, grazing her chopsticks against the bottom of her plate, “Yeah, that sounds about right. You can be anyone, get in anywhere, frame anyone they want. I was just an idiot, thinking I was helping. By the time I figured out what I really was, it was too late…”

“Better than me. At least you did something about it at the end.”

“I murdered a man and sacrificed my freedom, all so the HPSC can go on with business as usual. I didn’t do anything.” Kaina then peered at her, looking back at Tomura, who still sat back with his hands in his pockets. “What is this? Is this supposed to make us friends? Look, I can sympathize, but you’re still working with the League of villains. You made your choice.”

Himiko shrugged, “So did you.”

“I’m here because I don’t really have another choice.”

“Did I?”

“You did after you escaped. How many people have you killed since then? Innocent people?”

“All I’m saying is I want to see them burn, too.”

“You guys want to see the whole world burn.”

“Not true,” Tomura finally chimed in, a smirk growing on his face, “But, a piece will do.”

“I’m saying I’ll help,” Himiko said. “Like you said, my quirk is useful.”

“I don’t want your help. I told you all that I’m not going to kill anyone.”

Himiko pouted, “Aww-”

“Toga…” Tomura chastised her.

“Ugh, fine. I won’t kill anyone.”

Kaina clearly wasn’t amused as she got up, taking her plate to the kitchen sink. She started washing her plate, speaking without looking back at them, “What was your training like?”

Himiko leaned back on her hands, a brow raised, “They just trained me to kill. What else would they do?”

“Did they educate you? Try and teach you philosophies, morals, anything?”

“Yeah, kind of. They always tried to give me stuff. Whenever I act out, they take things away. It was like they always tried to act like they were helping, like they were guardians instead of captors. They also tried to teach me all their HPSC rules and junk.”

Kaina hummed to herself, placing her clean plate on the drying rack, “Figures. After me, they probably realized I was given too much freedom. If they tried to indoctrinate you, then they were successful with whoever came before you. They got you young, so they probably got the other one young too. Children are easier to mold, it was another one of their mistakes with me. So, I’m looking for one of the younger Pros, probably in their twenties; thirties at maximum.”

“That’s a lot of heroes,” Tomura scoffed.

“It still narrows it down by a lot.” Kaina turned around, crossing her arms as she leaned back against the counter, “Is that all?”

Tomura chuckled, sending a quick text to Kurogiri, “Go on ahead, Toga. Our presence still disgusts her.”

A portal opened up behind them, with Himiko skipping through, “Later, Assassin Sister!”

“Don’t call me that!” But, she was already gone. Kaina groaned, dragging her hand down her face. Her gaze shifted to Tomura, who still stood by her kotatsu. “Yes?”

“Have you thought about what we talked about last time?”

Kaina sighed, “I have a feeling you’ll keep pestering me about it either way, so just ask me a question. *One* question. I can’t be here all day.”

Tomura nodded, complying far easier than Kaina had anticipated. “What do you expect to change with all this?”

Kaina narrowed her eyes, “...You mean besides exposing the HPSC for dozens of murders and other conspiracies?”

“Well, yeah, I mean what’s that gonna do?”

"It’ll get rid of everyone at the top, or at least put them under investigation and get them out of power. It'll be a clean slate."

"Lady, the only real clean slate that'll work is the one that *actually* cleans it all up. The HPSC is the entire reason heroes are what they are these days. They made heroes gods that people worship, when they’re just celebrities not worth the words they spit out. To keep that illusion up at all costs, they chose to turn you into an assassin, just to keep the ‘peace’. What’s gonna stop them from doing it again? You don't want history to repeat itself, so don't give it the chance."

Kaina shook her head, "You can't just get rid of a government branch, especially one that gives heroes salaries to pay for their families, food, education. That's just asking for chaos. That's not how the world works."

"I'm just saying, maybe we don't need 'em."

"So you're an anarchist?"

"Anarchy? Nah. Sounds kinda fun at first, but that would end quickly and pointlessly. I'm just saying if something causes more harm than good, why have it at all?"

"The idea itself isn't the problem, it's who's in charge of it. Someone can make a company prosper, while the other can run it into the ground."

"Then who's gonna be in charge? You?"

"Yeah, sure. The convict. If I can expose the problems, the people who oppose them can make sure they don't happen again."

"Hm...Now who doesn't know how the world works?"

Kaina scoffed, turning away from him, "I'm not gonna apologize for wanting a better world and not a destroyed one."

"...Now, that we can agree on."

**(** **UA: Ground Beta: Faux City Street** **)**

  
  
  

“Are we sure this is a good idea? This feels…” Kyouka looked down at her hands, The Equalizer at the ready, and then at the buildings all around her. “...unsafe.”

They stood in the center of what seemed to be Ground Beta’s downtown area. Buildings from five-stories tall to ten-stories tall loomed on either side of the couple, the street ending about two-hundred meters away at an intersection. Cars were sparsely parked along the sides of the road, restaurants, outside dining areas, working streetlights, etc.

She still couldn’t believe how detailed this recreation was. It felt like they were in a movie where they were the last two people on Earth. All they needed were a bunch of clothes lying around, and it would look like Imperfect Cell ran through here.

“What else are we supposed to do?” Izuku asked from a safe(?) distance, from twenty-meters away. “We need to test out your ultimate.”

“I know, but the move causes *small* quakes. I’m pretty confident in my control of my new strength, but there’s always a chance I bring down one of these buildings on us.”

“Do you really think you can do that? I-...Wait…We’ve never actually tested out how strong your jacks are now, have we?” Izuku furrowed his brow, rubbing his chin in thought. “I mean, not *really.* We know your hearing and their actual physical strength has been enhanced, but what about their output? Your jacks create vibrations through the pulse of your heartbeat, and your gear is meant to boost that further. Let’s see what you can do without your gear.”

Kyouka blinked a couple times, raising a brow at her boyfriend, “I repeat: Are we sure this is a good idea?”

“We have to find out, and we might as well do it while in a training environment intended to be destroyed. Better now than during a life or death battle. Or, in my case, during the entrance exams that will change your life.” 

“Eh, fair point. I’m only going to try twenty-percent, though. I don’t wanna take the chance and explode my jacks into a red mist. Alright, get further back. Earplugs in, too!”

In a flash of green light, Izuku ran further down the street, Mei-Provided earplugs in and hands over ears. He gave her a thumbs-up, “Yes, ma’am!”

Kyouka turned back, facing down the empty faux-city street, skyscrapers looming on either side of her. She unclipped her headphones from her belt and placed them on her head, her own heartbeat thumping in her ears. She raised her jacks out in front of her, the appendages beginning to glow brightly as violet sparks crackled around her body. 

“Okay…Three…Two…”

***\*SCHREEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!!!\****

Kyouka wasn’t exactly sure what she had been expecting, but she underestimated herself.

Soundwaves blasted out of her jacks. Every window on that street shattered, their shards shining in the sunlight as if it was raining diamonds. Car alarms blared, the ground cracked into thousands of pieces, dust and debris flying down the street as they were caught in the shockwave. Buildings rumbled, but none took a punishment like the one at the end of the street. It took the full brunt of Kyouka’s quirk, the entire face of the building breaking apart. 

Kyouka quickly stopped her soundwaves, her eyes going wide as she watched the face of the building down the road begin to fall apart from the rest of itself, crumbling to the ground. Puffs of dust plumed into the air, the sound of concrete and metal hitting the ground was masked by the echo of Kyouka’s quirk still ringing across campus.

One of the UA bots rolled out from one of the buildings, its visor cracked. It blinked a few green lights, all of the cars in the vicinity beeping, and their alarms silencing before the bot rolled back to its station.

Kyouka was ironically silent, completely stunned. She turned around, finding Izuku in the same stupor as her. Until, a big smile slowly grew on Izuku’s face. “That…was…”

“AWESOME!!!” Kyouka finished for him, smiling in return. Her jacks hurt like Hell, and bruising was already starting to form. But, they were still attached and not bleeding, so she counted this as a win. Thank goodness her jacks were durable already, or this would’ve ended a lot differently. 

The only problem was how they were going to explain this to Aizawa, who was driving up to them in a cart- Oh…

In one of the eight-seater UA golf carts used to get around campus, Toshinori and Aizawa pulled up just behind Izuku. Both of them were staring at the two teens standing in a level of destruction that made it seem like a bomb went off.

Aizawa stepped out of the cart, with the couple unsure which emotion was most prominent on his face: Shock, Anger, or Confusion.

Toshinori got out of the cart, looking over to Kyouka, “...Was this you?”

“...Yeah.”

“...Hell yeah!” Toshinori laughed in amazement, walking up to the teens, glass crunching under his shoes. “That’s amazing! Oh my God, I mean-! Was that even your full power? Just imagi-...”

Toshinori quickly shut his mouth as his eyes landed on Aizawa, clearly not as amused by this as he was. “What. The *hell.* Was that?!”

“I-It was my idea, sir!” Izuku quickly nervously interjected, already feeling the weight of Aizawa’s stare upon him . “I just realized that we never actually tested out how powerful Kyouka’s quirk had gotten, and I figured we needed to gauge it before we tried out any ultimate moves, so…”

“I’m just as much to blame!” Kyouka tried pulling the focus back to her. “I know I should be more careful, I jus-”

Aizawa raised his hand up, silencing them both as his other hand pinched the bridge of his nose. “This is why I gave you the nicknames. Without even bringing up the fact that you could have blown your jacks off, how are we even supposed to explain this? That was probably heard thirty kilometers from here, so the entire campus heard that. You’re not the only two scheduled to use this testing ground, so people are going to come here and see this before the bots can fix it.”

“People know how powerful Izuku is,” Kyouka shrugged. “That, along with my gear, people will believe we caused this amount of damage.”

“People will really believe your gear enhances your quirk that much?”

“Mei,” the couple said simultaneously. 

Aizawa was silent, not really having a rebuttal to that. Toshinori looked at him and shrugged, “I’d believe it. Young Hatsume is the best I’ve seen since David Shield. I’ve also been on the receiving end of her Boombox, it’s no joke.”

“Ugh, fine,” Aizawa groaned, turning back to the cart. “C’mon, let’s get out of here before anyone’s curiosity gets the better of them.”

“Recovery Girl, please!” Kyouka said as she and Izuku made their way to the golf cart. “I’d much prefer being able to move my jacks.”

Aizawa merely grunted in response as they got in the cart, taking the row of seats behind Aizawa and All Might. As they began to drive through the city, something came to Izuku’s mind. “Wait a minute. I completely forgot to tell Recovery Girl about Kyouka!”

“It’s fine, I did,” Aizawa replied. “Once I was told she was in on this whole thing, I figured her and I should tell her I was brought in too. She was confused, to say the least, but who wouldn’t be?”

Toshinori looked back at the teens, “That reminds me, what was Torino’s reaction to all this?”

Izuku and Kyouka looked at each other, panic flaring in their eyes. Kyouka looked back at her teacher, leaning forward in her seat. “...You didn’t tell Torino?”

“I-? What?! *You* didn’t tell Torino?!” Toshinori countered back, his panic matching theirs. “This is your big thing, not mine! I’m not taking the brunt force of this! I wasn't even there when it happened! I already had to face your parents!”

“He’s your teacher!”

“It’s your quirk!”

Aizawa slowly smiled, “My mood is suddenly much better.”

Ignoring his coworker, Toshinori dragged his hand down his face, shifting his eyes in thought, “...You know, we could just…not tell him yet.”

The couple shared a look, with Kyouka playing along, “He’s super busy looking for the League. What kind of people would we be to put that kind of stress on him right now?”

Izuku wrung his hands together, “I don’t know, it still feels like he should know.”

“He’ll know,” Toshinori reassured him. “...Eventually. Besides, you two have to focus on getting your licenses. That should be your priority.”

“Speaking of which,” Aizawa cut in, looking at Izuku in the rearview mirror, “It’s been two days and you haven’t started on your ultimate moves.”

“I-I’ve started! I just…haven’t gotten anywhere.” Izuku felt the pressure of Aizawa’s scrutinizing deadpan gaze upon him, nervously clearing his throat. “The problem with having somebody else’s quirk is you basically have their moveset too. A lot of what I can do with a body enhancer is pretty basic, ironically with how complicated One For All is.”

“That *should* be true,” Aizawa nodded, making a turn, the main gate now in sight down the road. “However, this quirk has changed multiple times throughout the timespan that you’ve had it.”

Toshinori scoffed, leaning his good arm on the back of his seat, “Tell me about it. Thirty years with the damn thing and I didn’t get any other cool powers.”

Aizawa raised a brow at him, “You flew.”

“At the very end! Speaking of which, Young Izuku, have you learned anything about that?”

Izuku sighed, shaking his head, “Nana’s been gone since Kamino. I’ve entered the Vestige Space a few times when I go to sleep, but I can’t find her anymore. She’s just gone. I can’t ask her about any of the other users’ quirks.”

“Mm, just give her all the time she needs. She’ll be back. After what she learned, well…Devastating is a weak word. Although, I suppose keeping things less complicated for the time being is for the best. Even if it's possible to gain access to other powers, you can’t use them openly. We can’t focus on new quirks anyway. Focus on what you *can* do. I understand your worry about copying me, but your ultimate moves aren’t about finding something new. They’re about fine-tuning your abilities, showing mastery of yourself. You think at a billion miles-a-minute, my boy. Don’t get too far ahead of yourself.”

“...A step back can be the way forward,” Izuku mumbled to himself. 

“Exactly…I think.”

Kyouka chuckled, “That ‘Teaching for Dummies’ book really must work.”

“Hey! I told you to forget you saw that!”

“You think I listened?”

“Ironically, no,” Toshinori sighed, turning back to Izuku. “You’ll think of something, kid. With your mind and talent, there’s no doubt. As someone who’s fought you, I know how creative you can get.”

Izuku chuckled dryly, “Well, I highly doubt there are going to be any generators for me to absorb power from at the License Exam.”

“Hmhm, probably not. Perhaps Young Kaminari can act as a substitute battery for you.”

“Mei said the little golden bolts on my suit are meant to attract electricity, so I shouldn’t drain as fast as I usually do.”

“Good, because I can say from experience that energy of yours really packs a punch.”

Izuku’s brow furrowed at that, thinking back through the conversation, as well as his old lesson from Torino. “...Packs a punch.”

Kyouka smirked at him, instantly recognizing that look on his face, “You got something?”

Izuku looked down at his hands, his own smirk growing on his lips, “...I think so.”

**(** **Night: Heights Alliance Building 1A: Common Room** **)**

  
  
  

“So, Jirou, I couldn’t help but notice you and a certain someone were matching today.”

Kyouka deadpanned over at Mina as all the girls sat around the couches near the front of the first floor, drinks in hand. How Kyouka managed to give a Kubrick Stare still look effective with a juicebox in hand, Mina would never know. 

She would also never know how she managed to convince Kyouka to hang out with them instead of her boy toy, who was training just outside. Although, she could see Kyouka’s gaze flicker over to the window every ten seconds at minimum. 

“Just because I told you about my relationship, doesn’t mean I want to talk about it. It also took you less than a week to spill your guts to someone who didn’t know,” Kyouka replied, nodding towards Tsu.

Tsu just shrugged, “It’s been obvious since I’ve known you two, ribbet. You two being a Hero Duo pretty much sealed it.”

Mina raised her hands up in defense, “I’m just pointing it out. I never expected to see Midoriya wear make-up.”

“I’m not gonna make the poor schmuck wear face paint everyday. I think some days I’m gonna paint on a design to match his freckles.”

Ochako’s face clenched up, a hand over her heart, “You’re killing me with cuteness.”

Tooru leaned forward across from Kyouka, “What’s it like?”

Kyouka side-eyed her, really hoping she was asking about being in a relationship and not certain activities done when in said relationship. “What?”

“Being in a relationship. I see all these romance movies and stuff, an-...I don’t know. You guys always just seem like you’re in your own little world together.”

“I…I mean, I can’t speak for anyone else. I have no clue what relationships are supposed to be like, but ours works for us. Honestly, I’m a little surprised none of you have been in a relationship before. You’re all so…you know.”

“Gorgeous in mind, spirit, and body,” Mina completed for her. “Yeah, we know, but so are you. You were just the lucky one of us that landed the hunk of man.”

Kyouka deadpanned at her again, “Okay, end of the love talk.”

“You said you love him!” Mina and Tooru cheered.

“Okay, that’s enough,” Momo chastised them. “Boundaries, girls.”

Both girls pouted, sinking into the couch cushions, “Yes, ma’am.”

“Now, how’s everyone’s training going?”

Ochako pumped her fists in excitement, “I can finally float myself without puking everywhere…for like, thirty seconds, but still!”

Momo smiled at her friend before turning to Kyouka, “I suppose with Izuku on the mind—”

“When is he not?” Mina giggled.

“I know Izuku’s been having trouble with his own moves,” Momo continued. “Has he made any progress?”

“Good question.” Kyouka got up, grabbing another juicebox from the table. “I’m gonna go check.”

“Oh no, ten minutes have passed since you’ve seen your boyfriend,” Mina said, sarcastically. “I’m surprised you survived.”

“Me too,” Kyouka played along, heading out the front door and into the cool night air. She made it down the front steps, already seeing Izuku over by one of the trees in the side yard, a decent distance away from the building. She made her way across the grass, watching her boyfriend write stuff down in his journal.

Or, actually *their* journal. 

Izuku was still the main writer, but she had contributed to a decent chunk of the entries since she got him his fourteenth journal on his birthday.

“Heads up, Pretty Boy.” Kyouka threw the juicebox at him, with Izuku turning at the sound of her voice and catching it with ease. “How’s it coming along?”

Izuku didn’t answer, he merely smiled. Setting his juicebox down on one of the exposed tree roots, he clenched his fists, his body glowing as One For All flowed through him. He channeled his excess power towards his hands, but instead of releasing it as a controlled pulse like he learned at Torino’s, he kept it all stored in his fists.

Kyouka watched as Izuku’s fists began to glow bright cyan— almost a piercing white— and slowly faded as it went up his arms. Izuku’s usual lightning crackled and coiled around his body, rather than dissipating quickly. It struck against his skin, moving along his body as if it didn’t want to go. It was like she was watching her boyfriend turn into a tesla coil in slow motion.

“Okay, and then we just…” Izuku pulled his fist back, throwing a few jabs at the air. Power sparked off of him with each punch, and Kyouka could hear the hum of the energy.

Izuku threw a wide haymaker into the open space in front of him, his energy releasing in a shotgun blast of green electricity and arcing into an unstable pulse rippling through the air.

“Phew,” Izuku wiped his brow, chuckling to himself as he watched the last sparkles of light vanish. “I don’t have a name for it yet, we can workshop it later. At the moment it’s kind of hard to focus on it while trying to fight.”

Kyouka crossed her arms, going over to him and leaning against the tree, “Ok, just so I fully get it, you take your excess power and store it in your hands.”

“Yeah. That way I can hit harder without actually increasing One For All’s percentage, and I can still release it as a pulse on impact.”

“...Have I told you how sexy I find your nerdy brain?”

“Quite a lot, actually.”

“Not enough. We’ll work on names later. At least we both have starting points now. The only problem is we still have to come up with an ultimate Move that we can both do.”

Izuku leaned on the tree too, “Well, technically you can do my ultimate move too. I just need to teach you how.”

“I can’t use it publicly, though.”

“That doesn’t matter. You need all the training I’ve gotten. You never know when you and I will have to work together and go all out. We’ll need every trick up our sleeve that we can get.”

“It’s been almost a month, but I still can’t really process all this power. What I did at Ground Beta today was insane.”

  
“It’s a lot, I know. I realized back during my internship that I still have trouble leaving my quirkless mindset. Even for somebody who already had a quirk like you, suddenly having access to such power isn’t something you just accept overnight. I think about what I can do now, and then I remember all the reports of All Might back in his prime. We can’t use all of our power right now, but technically we’re both stronger than that. Lifting buildings, jumping across cities, breaking the sound barrier, it’s all so-”

“Wait a second…sound barrier.” 

“You got something this time?”

“I think so,” Kyouka smirked. “Something for tomorrow.”

“Have I ever told you how sexy I find your creative brain?”

“Quite a lot, actually.”

“Not enough.”

Kyouka giggled, taking Izuku’s arm and hugging it to her chest, walking back towards the dorms. Her jack reached back, picking up Izuku’s forgotten juicebox and placing it in her jogger’s pocket. “Unfortunately, I don’t think my idea is something that we can do together.”

“I figured. Although you might not be able to use any energy openly, it doesn’t mean you can’t use mine.”

Kyouka raised her brow as she gazed up at him, “I’ve already got two weapons to carry. I’m not wearing a battery pack.”

  
“Hmhmhm, no, not that. I can carry your stuff if you want, but what I meant was I think you could weaponize my energy. We need an ultimate move that works for both of us, and with your hammer…”

“...You’ve been holding on to that ‘Thunder and Lightning’ attack name all this time, haven’t you?”

“It works! Especially now!”

Kyouka chuckled as they reached the front steps of the dorms, “We’ll have to talk to Mei again.”

“You say that like we’re burdening her, when in actuality nothing would make her happier.” 

“Burdening her? We’re the ones caught in her explosions and get faces filled with boobs.”

Izuku chuckled, opening the door for her, “Who knows? Maybe it’ll be your turn this time.”

  
  
  
  

***…~AMP~...***

  
  
  
  

**(** **Two Weeks Later: National Takoba Arena** **)**

  
  
  

The 1A bus pulled into the curved entry road to the arena’s front building, only a small fraction of the size compared to the massive stadium-like construct behind it. Izuku had thought the UA Stadium was huge, but this was insane. 

Other buses and crowds of students were already at the entrance, piling into the building by the dozen. 

Aizawa got up from his seat near the front of the bus, looking back at his students as they parked. “We’re here. They’re going to explain to you the rules once you’re inside.

The bus door opened and they all filed out of the bus, everyone looking around at all of the different Hero Schools in attendance. With how much you hear about UA in the populace, it was almost hard to remember that there were multiple Hero Courses around Japan. 

AMP stepped off the bus, their friends not far behind. Each had their respective cases with their costumes, with another case strapped to each of their backs. Izuku had the Boombox, and Kyouka the Equalizer. 

“Holy crap,” Ochako said as she got off the bus, looking around at the different students. “There’s gotta be like a thousand people here. There’s no way this is gonna be like the Sports Festival, right? Going against all of these people would take all day, probably more.”

“I doubt it,” Tenya shook his head. “My brother told me about his exams. He said that it was mostly simulated villains and civilians. Almost every year the passing rate is fifty-percent or more, so they’ll likely grade us individually as we go, and pass us once a certain requirement is reached. Although, we go to a school that has already pitted us against each other in combat multiple times, so…”

“We’re screwed,” Kyouka nodded, her nerves getting to her.

“We’ll be just fine,” Momo chuckled, a hand on Kyouka’s shoulder. “We just have to work together.”

“If they give us that chance,” Kyouka sighed. Her jacks poked Izuku in his side with a smirk, “The perks of being a package deal is they have to let us work together.”

“Don’t jinx it,” Izuku scoffed. “They’ll find a way.”

“C’mon, I could really use my ‘optimistic to a fault’ boyfriend, right now.”

Izuku laughed, his hand finding her back, “We’re going to get our licenses; all of us. If we passed a battle exam against All Might— even one holding back and intentionally handicapped— then we can pass this. We’re better than we were back then, and we’re even greater together.”

“There he is,” Kyouka grinned. “Let’s do this thing.”

“Alright, reprobates!” Aizawa got his students’ attention as the last one stepped down from the bus. “I expect each and every one of you to get your licenses today, because what’s our class motto?”

“Don’t embarrass you,” 1A said in unison. 

“Perfect,” Aizawa nodded, a satisfied smile on his face.

“What happened to Plus Ultra?!” Everyone jumped in surprise, turning around to see a taller boy with buzzed, brown hair and dark, intense eyes. He had a crazy look in his eyes and a wide smile, but that was becoming the norm these days.

“Inasa,” a boy with purple fringe and a matching school uniform called out to him, standing with the rest of what they could assume was his classmates. “You’re intruding into their group.”

“I am SO! VERY!” Inasa bowed so far down that he slammed his head into the concrete, “SORRY!!!”

Kyouka didn’t even look shocked. She just looked over to Izuku, “One of us attracts the crazy ones, and I can’t tell which one of us it is.”

Izuku shrugged, “You attracted me, and I’ve been called crazy. I’m pretty sure you’ve even called me crazy.”

“...Shit.”

Inasa stood back up, unfazed by the blood dripping down from his forehead, “I’ve just always wanted to say PLUS ULTRA! I freakin’ love UA!”

Everyone was silent, not quite sure what to say. Denki just gave him a thumbs-up, smiling awkwardly, “Uh, thanks, du— And he’s walking away.”

Inasa marched back to his class, his attention on UA now completely gone. Sero walked up next to Denki, just as confused as him, “Who the hell was that?”

“Inasa Yoarashi,” Aizawa answered, eyeing the teen suspiciously as he spoke to his other classmates. “He was supposed to be with all of you, under special recommendation. His grades alone would’ve gotten him in, but he backed out at the last minute.”

Tsu turned to her teacher, “You’re saying we could’ve had him instead of Mineta?”

“Hey!” Minoru cried out. “I’ve been on good behaviour!”

“He’s strong,” Aizawa continued, ignoring their antics. “Everyone keep an eye on him. Keep an eye on all of them, in fact.”

“All of them?” Kyouka raised a brow, turning to Izuku. “Encyclopedia?”

“That’s Shiketsu High,” Izuku explained, watching them begin walking towards the main entrance. “They’re probably the only Hero Course that can rival UA.”

“...Oh boy.” Kyouka looked past Izuku, finding Shoto’s gaze still locked onto Inasa. “You good, Shoto?”

Hearing his name, Shoto was shaken from his thoughts, “Hm? Oh, yeah. That guy just seems familiar, I guess.”

They watched the Shiketsu students walk by, with the couple catching the eye of a long-haired blonde with glossy lips and dark brown eyes. The bubbly blonde lit up as she saw the couple, winking as she blew a kiss their way.

Kyouka scowled, glaring a hole through her head, "He's taken, bimbo."

"The kiss was for both of you, sexy."

Kyouka’s face bloomed with a deep pink, her eyes wide, "Wh-? I ju-! Wh-...I…I don't know how to respond to this." 

“By calling me!” She laughed back as she walked into the building with her class. 

The couple sat there in stunned silence before Kyouka swiveled around to Izuku, “...What the hell was that?!” 

“Don’t care,” Aizawa cut in, turning towards the building. "Okay, class, follow me. We need to-..."

Aizawa suddenly froze, looking out into the distance. Everyone looked at their teacher in confusion, with Sato asking, “Uh, Mr. Aizawa? You good?” 

Aizawa held his hand up, silencing him. It was like he was sensing something. He sniffed at the air, silent as he stared into nothingness, “...She’s here.”

"Eraser!” A voice called out, causing Aizawa’s eyes to go wide. From the crowd emerged a woman Izuku instantly recognized as Ms. Joke. She skipped over to the class, smiling brightly at their teacher. “There you are! I've missed-...Awww, where'd he go?"

Kaminari furrowed his brow, "What do you mean? He's right he— Ah! What the-?!"

The class all looked back to see Aizawa nowhere to be found, vanished into thin air.

“Bah, it’s okay!” Emi giggled, smiling wide as her pupils shrunk. “...I always find him in the end.”

“...The hell-?”

“Anyway! Good to see Eraser didn’t fail any of his students this year; that’s rare! Hey, why dontcha meet my students? Ketsubutsu 2-2! Get on over here!”

Another group of students turned at the sound of their teacher’s voice, getting excited once they recognized the UA uniforms. As they got closer, Mina shifted over to Kyouka, elbowing her arm, “The cutie in the front remind you of anyone?”

Kyouka rolled her eyes, “He’s kinda got Izuku’s hairstyle. Doesn’t make him my type.”

“...Is your type only Izu-?”

“Only Izuku.”

“Ugh, you two are so cute it hurts.”

The said student led the pack of Ketsubutsu students, rushing up to each and every one of the UA students and shaking their hands. “The name’s Shindo! It’s great to meet you guys! You UA guys have been hit with the worst this year, but you’re all still here trying to be heroes? That’s the kind of fortitude heroes need these days!”

Kyouka leaned over and mumbled to Izuku, *“Kind of a kiss ass-”*

“And you two!” Kyouka was cut off as Shindo got to them, shaking each of their hands. “The Dynamic Duo of the Sports Festival! You guys were great. Your fights against Todoroki and that fight at the end against Bakugou were awesome! Kinda brutal, but still.”

“Uh, th-thanks…” Izuku awkwardly smiled, really hating how much that fight has come back to haunt him in the last couple months.

“And, of course, the one at the center of it all, the one at the heart of Kamino.” Shindo moved over to Katsuki, reaching his hand out to him. “The news said you escaped all on your own. Now that's so-”

“Cut that crap and get outta my face,” Katsuki smacked Shindo’s hand away, glared at him with disdain. “Your stupid hair already reminds me of somebody I hate, but it’s that mug of yours that spells it all out. You don’t mean any of this shit. Whatever you’re after, forget it. Just go back to your shitty classmates and prepare to die.”

“Okay, let’s go!” Kirishima got between them, pushing Katsuki away. “I’m sorry about him, he’s got issues!”

“The fuck’s that supposed to mean?!” 

Kyouka perked up, a wide grin instantly on her face, “Oh, I’ll translate! He means your anger issues, your superiority complex, your lack of emotional complexity and understanding, your-”

“Shut the fuck up, Earlobes!” 

“Hey…” Izuku growled out, his glare dancing the line between a warning and a threat.

“Just leave it, man!” Kirishima sighed, continuing to push Katsuki away. “We need to focus. C’mon, let’s go get signed in.”

Katsuki smacked Kirishima’s hands off of him, giving Kyouka one last glare before conceding. He took his leave, heading towards the entrance.  
  

Tenya cleared his throat, beginning to usher the class towards the building, “Alright, everyone. We should follow their example. Let’s all go get signed in and dressed in our costumes. The briefing is in half-an-hour.”

1A began their trek towards the arena, with the couple hanging back a bit. Izuku turned to Kyouka as they walked, his hand finding hers as they semi-hid their interlocked fingers between their bodies, “The hatred between you two is gonna explode some day.”

“Hello, Pot. The name’s Kettle. Have we met?”

Izuku chuckled a little, his eyes finding the back of Katsuki’s head in the sea of students. Katsuki had yelled at Kyouka before, it wasn’t new. But, it got to him more and more every time. Kyouka didn’t care, in fact she probably loved how much she irritated Katsuki. 

Her hatred for the blonde was almost unmatched.

…Almost.

Izuku shook his head, punching down that rageful feeling in his gut that felt all too familiar. It hardly ever got to see the light of day, but he wouldn’t let it poke its ugly head out.

Not today.

“Problem Children.”

“AH!” Both teens jumped, turning around to find their teacher had reappeared, his eyes looking around frantically and his voice low. *“I don’t have much time, so we’ll make it fast. Jirou, when it comes to using your newfound abilities,* *try to keep it to an absolute minimum, alright? Only for emergencies, and low percentages. Don’t use it in front of any of your classmates.”*

Kyouka’s brows rose, taken aback by the advice, *“I’m surprised you’re not telling me to not use One For All at any cost.”*

*“It’s like I told All Might, we need you two to get your licenses over anyone else here. This isn’t favoritism, it’s doing what needs to be done. When something related to our little group arises, we can’t have police breathing down our necks because you acted without some damn paperwork. If you use it very sparingly, only for emergencies, where almost nobody can see you, you can get away with it. If anyone did see anything mildly questionable, they’ll forget it ever even happened. Everyone here has far more important things to worry about, and they don’t know the extent of your base quirk. Listen, all I’m saying is to be smart about it. You did it back at camp before you even knew what you were doing, you sure as hell can do it now.”*

*“Yes, sir.”*

*“Good. Now, I gotta go befo-* ”

“Found you!” Ms. Joke appeared out of nowhere, latching onto Aizawa’s arm with an iron grip. “C’mon, I saved us some seats!”

Aizawa was dragged away in the blink of an eye before he could say a word, leaving the couple alone once more. 

“...Welp, he’s dead. C’mon, let’s go ace this thing.”

**(** **Ten Minutes Later: National Takoba Arena** **)**

  
  
  

*“Zzzzz…Zzzzz…Zzzzz…Zzzzz…”*

“...Is he okay?” Ochako asked. 1A stood in a massive conference room filled with hundreds of different Hero Course students. At the front of the room was a stage with a long table reaching from one end to the other, with HPSC representatives at every seat. 

The shaggy-haired man in question was the one at the center podium, completely passed out and snoring into the mic. It echoed throughout the room, with everyone silent and waiting for someone to wake him up. 

Kyouka sighed, her jack extending out above everyone’s heads and going over to the podium, poking the man in the forehead, *“Zzz-* AH! Ur-! Eh, where am I? Oh, right, welcome everyone. I’m Mera, with the Hero’s Public Safety Commission. We’re short-staffed and I’m incredibly tired, so let’s get this over with.”

“Wow…” Kyouka deadpanned as she wiped off her jack once it came back to her.

“Before we begin, there are some differences with this year's testing compared to previous years that you need to be aware of. There are just over one-thousand five-hundred of you participating this year, and usually we have about a fifty-percent passing rate. However, due to the controversy that has arisen from the Hero Killer incident earlier this year, along with the recent stunt pulled a couple weeks ago at our Tokyo HQ, some changes have been made. The people are beginning to question and doubt who should be assigned the role of Pro Hero. Sure, it would be great for everyone to want to do this job with no compensation, but that’s not how modern society works. However, it is true that this profession has become very saturated. So, here’s what’s gonna happe— *Zzzz…Zzzz…Zzzz…”*

“For the love of-” Kyouka extended her jack out again, this time slapping Mera across the face.”

“Wh-?! Ah, the window of time it takes for a hero to arrive and take care of major emergencies is extremely small. So, to weed out the best of the best, only the first one-hundred examinees to meet the passing requirements will receive their licenses today.”

The crowd erupted into protests and murmurs, with someone shouting, “There’s over a thousand of us!”

Mera put his hands up in defense, “Now, now, I know that sounds bad…”

“...” The room was silent again, waiting for him to continue.

“...Okay, so here are the rules. Once you enter the testing arena, there will be crates filled with attachable disks, or ‘targets’, and a lot of balls.” Denki and Sero immediately began snickering, both receiving smacks to the back of the head from Mina, who had a tiny smirk on her face too. “Everyone must attach three targets onto your body, and they must be exposed; no soles of the feet or armpits. You must also take six balls. If you have less than three targets, hidden targets, or you take more than six balls at the beginning, you’ll be immediately disqualified. The targets are programmed to light up once hit by the balls. Once all three of your targets are lit, you’re out. The first one-hundred examinees to defeat two other students get to move on. I’ve also been informed that we have a Hero Duo in the running today. Hm, pretty rare for a bunch of first and second years. Hopefully you’ve been informed that if one of you fails, both of you fail. You also need to collectively take out four students to win. If one of you takes out two students, you don’t pass until your partner also takes out their two. Okay, that’s about it. Once the room opens up, you’ll have one minute to prepare yourselves. Good luck, I guess.”

Shoto’s brow rose, “Opens up”

Kyouka’s jacks perked up, hearing locks in the walls open and gears shifting below them. Everyone in the room jostled as the ceiling above them opened up, the floor rising out into the open air. The walls around them sunk back down into the massive elevator shaft, revealing the testing area.

It was like someone took the UA testing grounds and clobbered them together into one huge arena. A rocky plain, city zone, industrial zone, forest area, mountain area, and a water area. 

Ochako shook her head in amazement, “Our tax dollars at work.”

The speakers buzzed, ringing out across the arena, *“Your minute begins now! Get moving!”*

Izuku rushed over to one of the crates surrounding the platform in a flash of lightning, bringing it back to his class and yanking the lid off. He began passing targets around as other classes began to do the same for their own groups, “Classes are going to stick together rather than go for the Free-For-All. We need to stick together. Keep at least two of your targets on the front of your body.”

“Bro, isn’t that the easiest place to hit,” Denki asked as he passed more targets back.

“It’s also the easiest way for you to defend yourself. You don’t want to put any targets in your blind spots. When we get out there, everyone get behind Kyouka and I. We’ve got you all covered.”

“To Hell with that,” Katsuki scoffed, his typical wicked grin growing on his face as he attached his targets to his body. “I’m gonna blow ‘em away.”

“Please don’t take cover,” Kyouka put her hands together, pretending to beg to Katsuki. *“Please* fail this test. Please, it would be so damn funny.”

“Not today, Earlobes. I don’t need your bullshit right now. I’m getting that license.”

“You’re doing a lot of talking to build-up the joke.”

“Hey,” Kirishima cut in between them, “Midoriya and I want our licenses too, so we’d rather not have to split our focus mediating you two.”

“Agreed,” Izuku lightly tugged on Kyouka’s jacket.

“I don’t need any fucking baby-sitting!” Katsuki sprinted away, practically giddy as he went to find some opponents.

***—“FIVE”—***

Kirishima sighed, picking up his rubber balls, “Welp, I’m gonna go babysit. Good luck, guys!”

***—“FOUR”—***

“Guys, we should be in groups!” Denki cried out as he ran after them. 

***—“THREE”—***

Shoto turned to his friends, walking backwards as he said, “I can’t use my quirk when we’re packed together like this. I’ll see you guys when we pass.”

***—“TWO”—***

“Good luck, man.” Kyouka let out a shaky breath as she pressed the blue button on the top of her Boombox, transforming it into its hammer state and hoisting it over her shoulder. “We ready, Izuku?”

***—“ONE”—***

Izuku widened his stance, sparks of cyan dancing across his skin, his fists clenching as power seeped into every fiber of his being. He could feel Kyouka just barely tap into their connection, keeping One For All at the ready. 

“More than ever.”

***—“BEGIN”—***
