Sirius watched Harry flying and tried to be sang-froid about the tricks and speed his son was capable of doing. Harry was fine; he was a good flyer like James. He wasn't going to fall off his broom or crash or…

Sirius leaned against the tree, folded his arms and looked over as Bill approached with some pumpkin juice.

"Thank you." Sirius said, accepting the glass of chilled liquid with a pleased smile. He still felt tired from the magic he'd performed but he didn't want to ruin Harry's first birthday with him and so had gone ahead with their plans as though nothing was wrong.

"Harry's giving Charlie a run for his galleon." Bill commented, looking up and shading his eyes as the players weaved in and out of each other. "I haven't seen anyone fly as good as him before but Harry is definitely in his league."

"I'm hoping Quidditch player is on his career list." Sirius admitted. "James wanted to play professionally but, well, with the war he thought he ought to sign-up as a Hit Wizard."

"I meant what I said earlier today; Harry would make a good curse-breaker." Bill commented and laughed at the dirty look Sirius gave him. "I was impressed with him." He fiddled with his drink. "I mean, learning the kid faced a basilisk to save my sister is one thing but actually seeing him deal with a situation that would send a lot of people twice his age running for the hills…"

"He's a very special kid." Sirius said gruffly, looking around to make sure Molly wasn't in earshot. She had been surprisingly courteous to him since they'd arrived, and had been polite the few times their path had crossed during the Longbottoms' party. Sirius was going with the assumption that someone had told her to be on her best behaviour. He wasn't going to risk endangering that by her finding out he'd allowed Harry to go into a dangerous situation.

"Well, I guess he's not so much a kid, but a young man at fourteen." Bill said, shielding his eyes to follow the flight of his brother. "I remember thinking I was an adult at that age no matter what my Mum said."

Sirius glanced at Bill speculatively. "How are you finding your service?"

Bill's head snapped to him in surprise. "To be truthful it doesn't feel like service." He admitted after thinking about it. "I'm doing a job I love for a cause that I fully support. My long term career isn't affected and while the Unspeakables and I aren't exactly sharing knowledge openly, it's not hard to pick up their tricks in the field. And I get a great place to stay into the bargain."

"Ah, London Street." Sirius said nostalgically. "That place has a lot of memories for me. James and I moved in after school; young, free and single – well, me; James was already engaged to Lily."

"I'll look after it." Bill promised.

"Don't forget to live in it too, Bill." Sirius advised. "The place was filled with a lot of fun and laughter. You'd be honouring the place if you made sure it was again."

Bill nodded.

"HE'S GOT THE SNITCH! HARRY'S GOT THE SNITCH!"

Ron's booming voice sounded out across the field.

Bill winced. "Got a pair of lungs on him, my youngest brother."

Sirius tucked his glass under his arm as he clapped while the players flew down. Neville who had been coerced into playing as a Beater was beaming happily; Ron was grinning ear to ear as was Harry. Susan looked chuffed to bits. The opposing team of the twins, Tonks and Charlie all looked chagrined.

Charlie gave a rueful grin as he landed. "Just as well I left before Potter here turned up at Hogwarts or I'd have lost my place on the team for sure."

Harry smiled back at him, dismounting. "I got lucky. I have the faster broom."

"It was skill." Charlie said.

Sirius smiled proudly and reached out to pat Harry's shoulder. "Well done, kiddo." He tried to hide the lingering tiredness he felt and figured he was only half-successful when Harry's eyes narrowed on him.

"I think we should probably have tea now." Harry declared.

"You're the boss." Bill said.

"*And* it's your birthday!" Fred and George said in unison.

Everyone chuckled but Sirius could see something flash across Ron's face – jealousy, maybe at the fact that Harry was Bill's boss in theory. But then Ron pulled Harry toward the Burrow and Sirius let it go; obviously whatever Ron felt had been fleeting. They made their way to the large trestle table just outside the Burrow's back door; it was adorned with goodies that Molly had laid out.

"Oh, lovely!" Molly beamed. "I was just about to call you all! Go wash up!"

The kids all exchanged knowing looks and headed inside.

Hermione set a platter of sandwiches down. "Is there anything else you need doing, Mrs Weasley?"

"No, you and Ginny can sit down now dear." Molly said, directing them to seats on either side of the table.

"This looks marvellous, Molly." Andromeda said warmly. "You've outdone yourself."

Molly smiled proudly as everyone gathered to eat, the kids trickling back from a hasty wash of their hands. "Thank you, Andy. Ron, why don't you sit beside Hermione here along with Andy and Ted? Ah, there you are Tonks. You take this seat here beside Charlie and Bill…Susan, why don't you take the one between the twins along with Neville. Percy and Penny…ah, Harry, you're here next to Ginny, and Minerva if you'd like to sit at the end of the table here by Remus…"

Sirius caught Andy's eye and they both turned away again quickly rather than start laughing out loud at Molly's obvious match-making.

"Sirius, you're here next to Harry on his other side." Molly pointed to the empty seat and Sirius gave her a grateful smile seeing the gesture as the olive branch it clearly was. She sat beside Sirius as Arthur took his place at the head of the table. "Well, tuck in everybody!"

The meal was excellent. Sirius could admit that Molly was a fine cook. The high tea was a myriad of pies, sandwiches and salads. A bench laden with desserts awaited them finishing their main course. The good food put them all in high spirits and the conversation was lively as the twins cajoled Remus into telling tales about the Marauders.

"Pranks!" Molly chided Remus. "Whatever were you thinking?"

"Good revision and practical application of spells." Remus promptly responded. "It certainly helped me ace my OWLs and NEWTs. The Prophet was right you know; Sirius was the top of our class overall, but I was top of Arithmancy, Sirius was top in DADA and Runes, James in Transfiguration. None of us could beat Lily for Charms or Severus for Potions but we came close. There's a lot of research and invention that goes into pranking. It was invaluable."

Fred and George exchanged a look that Sirius read all too well. They hadn't aced their OWLs – or probably had with the ones they wanted but had not paid attention to the rest – and were now worried about their mother's impending reaction because the results would be arriving any day. He'd overheard them whispering in the corner of the room about a joke shop and products. He wanted to help them since he thought it was an excellent idea but he figured Molly would kill him.

Remus pointed at the twins. "I'm pretty certain these two will ace their Potions, Charms, and Transfiguration OWLs. Don't you agree, Minerva?"

"I do." Minerva said, patting her mouth delicately with a napkin. "Your twins are very bright when they apply themselves, Molly."

Molly puffed up proudly.

"If they stay on and do well in their NEWTs, as the steward to two Ancient and Noble Houses who have produced members with a penchant for pranking, I might be predisposed to look over any business plans they might have for say, a joke shop?" Remus said casually.

Sirius almost choked on his juice. Only Moony could get away with that completely innocent look while being devious and conniving.

Fred and George were gazing with adoration at Remus while Molly looked torn since Remus, an ex-Professor no less, had made their planned career which she objected to in principle contingent on getting qualifications which she wanted more than anything. Minerva was hiding her smile in her napkin.

Harry leaned into Sirius. "Moony has to teach me how he does that whole innocence thing."

"Over my dead body," Sirius whispered back, "then you'd both be able to place the blame on me!" He winked at Harry who laughed quietly beside him.

An owl suddenly dove down to the table and landed beside Harry. The table quieted at the intrusion.

Sirius didn't recognise it and placed his hand on Harry's arm to stop him taking the letter. "Do you recognise the owl?"

"No." Harry fed the owl a piece of ham in lieu of bacon. "I don't think it's a Hogwarts' owl and the letter doesn't have a seal."

"It's not from the Ministry either." Percy said officiously.

Sirius frowned. Harry's owl ward had been reset but he still shouldn't have received any owls from people he didn't know. "I should check this first."

Harry frowned unhappily and Sirius knew he was thinking of how tired Sirius was after the previous day's escapades.

Bill reached over to check the letter. "Here, let me. It is part of my job, after all." He waved his wand over the owl and the parchment. "No curses, hexes or jinxes."

"Well, that rules out the twins." Charlie said joking and trying to lighten the atmosphere.

"Looks clean. Shall I open and read it?" Bill asked.

Sirius hoped it was just some fan that had managed to find a way to send Harry a note but he didn't like the uneasy feeling in his gut and he didn't want Harry reading it first. "Go ahead."

Harry's frown deepened at the intrusion into his privacy and he sent a glare at Sirius but thankfully didn't argue after a sharp look from Andromeda.

Bill unrolled the parchment. His face paled under his freckles. "Remus, Sirius; you should see this." He threw an apologetic look at Harry when he made to object. "Let me show them first, Harry."

Sirius got out of his seat and walked around to Bill as did Remus. Sirius and Remus read the parchment over Bill's shoulder.

"*Enjoy your birthday, Harry. It will be your last."*

His blood ran cold and his wand was out immediately as was Remus's. He motioned for Bill to turn it over and they checked the back of the parchment.

"*The Boy Who Lived, The Burrow."*

Sirius froze; they hadn't included Harry's unofficial and unwanted title in the mail ward reset but evidently magic recognised it if a letter had gotten through.

"Bugger." Bill swore.

Sirius looked at Remus and knew their decision was made in complete agreement.

"I'm sorry but this is a threat and we're moving everyone to Black Manor, now!" Sirius said, scanning the far treeline and the sky. "Anyone underage grab onto Harry; Penelope, Minerva, you go with them. Harry, use your ring to portkey and get everyone to safety now! We'll be right behind you!"

Harry's eyes were wide with fear and apprehension but he did as Sirius asked as his friends crowded around him.

"But…" Molly protested as the kids and Minerva disappeared.

Arthur glanced at the note Bill continued to hold and blanched. "I'll raise the rest of the wards." He hurried inside.

Remus had already sent a patronus message off to the Aurors by the time Tonks asked to see the note.

Andy cleared her throat. "Molly, why don't we box everything up so we can take it to the Manor?"

Sirius was grateful to his cousin as she managed Molly through the work and into the house to deal with the rest of the food and Harry's presents. Ted followed along with his wife after Tonks refused to leave on the basis that she was an Auror in training.

Remus nudged Sirius. "Take the others to the Manor and reassure Harry. We've got this. Bill and I can deal with the Aurors."

Sirius grabbed a plate and turned it into a portkey. He stepped into the Burrow and headed for Molly who had just finished packing.

"This is just terrible!" Molly wailed. "Who would do such a thing? And on his birthday?"

"I don't know but when I find out they're not going to be fully attached to their limbs for very long." Sirius growled.

Molly's eyes met his and for once it seemed that they agreed fully with each other.

Sirius offered her the plate. "It's a portkey to the Manor. Andy, Ted?"

They hurried over carrying a box each. A second later, the whirl of the portkey deposited them in the reception room of Black Manor.

Penelope hurried in. "The kids are in the Summer room with Minerva."

Sirius nodded. "Thanks. Get Kreacher to set up the remains of the meal in the dining room, please. Molly, if you could come with me, Andy and Ted; we may have to calm the kids down."

Molly nodded. "What are you intending to tell the children?"

"The truth." Sirius said bluntly.

"It's too much for them!" Molly immediately argued.

"Molly, they already *know*." Ted said firmly. "Sirius telling them a pack of lies to try and cover up what happened will not help matters."

"You can't tell me that it's right that a thirteen year old boy finds out that someone wants him dead!" Molly said furiously.

"He's fourteen," Sirius corrected tersely, "and Harry is already very aware that there are people in this world who are out there and ready to do him harm – he knows Peter's still at large for one thing!"

Molly bristled.

Andy moved forward and placed a comforting hand on her arm. "Molly, Sirius is right. Harry's situation isn't the same as another boy his age. Harry is too famous in our world and the Boy Who Lived is a target. His last three years at Hogwarts have already shown him that. To deny that there's a problem will only make him chafe against the protective restrictions I'm sure Sirius is about to place on Harry for the rest of the summer. If he understands the issue, he is likely to take better care not to sneak out or leave his guards behind."

For a long moment, Molly seemed to struggle with Andy's point of view but she suddenly subsided, nodding unhappily.

Sirius bit back words of anger and sarcasm that she was finally allowing him to do what he wanted with his son. He whirled away and headed for the Summer room.

Minerva had them all sitting down on the floor in a circle but they got up hurriedly as Sirius entered, Molly, Andy and Ted trailing in his wake.

"Where's Dad?" Ron demanded. "And my brothers?"

Fred and George nodded anxiously.

"They stayed behind to help guard the Burrow until the Aurors turned up." Sirius informed him briskly. He held up a hand. "Before you ask any more questions, let me explain."

They all gathered in front of him quietly, Minerva bringing up the rear.

"The letter that was sent made a rather nasty if implicit threat towards Harry – and no, Hermione, you don't need to know exactly what it said." Sirius said gravely, motioning for Hermione to put her arm down. "Obviously we have to take it seriously especially as it was obliquely addressed to Harry but specified the Burrow."

"So it was from somebody who knew Harry would be there today." Hermione surmised.

"Exactly." Sirius said. "Now, while it is more than likely today's note was a warning spell across a shield rather than notice of an imminent attack, better to be safe than sorry which is why we've moved venues. This place, while not being as cheery or as welcoming as the Burrow, is a veritable fortress and nobody need worry about being safe here."

Susan raised a hand and Sirius nodded for her to speak. "Have the Aurors been called?"

"Yes, and the rest of our missing party stayed behind to speak with them." Sirius said. "In the meantime, I think we should get on and celebrate Harry's birthday and show whoever it was who sent that note that they can't spoil our fun! What do you all say?"

A round of cheers, even if some of them were a little muted, agreed with him.

Molly attempted a smile. "The food is out in the dining room so why don't you all go finish up your meal?"

Ron led the way and the others followed at a more subdued rate, Molly, Ted and Andy chivvying them along.

Harry lagged behind. "What did it say?" He demanded when the rest of the party were out of the room.

Sirius sighed, debating inwardly about whether Harry needed to know the exact message. "Do you really want to know?"

"Yes!" said Harry. "I should know! It was addressed to me! Bill shouldn't have read it first!"

"I acknowledge that someone else reading your mail is an invasion but it was warranted in this case," Sirius shot back, "and what use is knowing the exact words of the threat going to be to you, hmmm?"

Harry glared at him but eventually his shoulders slumped as he forced himself to think past his immediate want to know. "I just…was it bad?"

"Bad enough that I need a hug." Sirius opened his arms and Harry moved into the hug quickly. The feel of Harry alive eased his own worry greatly. "It's not as though we weren't aware before that you're a target so it makes no real difference, but it is a bit scary and we're going to have to talk about security later. OK?"

Harry hugged him back.

"It's going to be OK, Harry." Sirius promised gruffly. He pressed a kiss to the top of Harry's head. "Come on. Let's go and celebrate your birthday."

Harry eased away from him without letting go and nodded. Sirius kept his arm around him and they both turned to the door and froze at the sight of Molly.

She had the grace to look embarrassed and pointed behind her. "We missed you and…well, I see you're on your way so…" she hurried away.

Sirius exchanged an amused look with Harry. They followed her into the dining room and Harry let Molly usher him into another seat by Ginny. Sirius rolled his eyes at him as he took the seat on the other side of Harry rather than his usual place at the top of the table.

By the time, the cake was on the table, everyone else from the Burrow had arrived along with Amelia who briefly confirmed everything was fine and the Burrow was secure. Eventually, the party wound down and the guests dispersed. A group remained behind and gathered in Sirius's study.

Sirius sat beside Harry on one sofa, Minerva sat in a chair, Bill perched on the desk while Remus and Amelia sat on the sofa opposite. Kreacher had popped in with drinks but they'd all eschewed food, stuffed from the spread Molly had cooked.

"What did the investigation turn up?" asked Sirius, sipping at his pumpkin juice.

"Well, firstly, the Aurors did a full sweep of the Burrow and the land beyond. No sign that anyone was poised to attack." Amelia assured them. "It looks like it was a warning but not a direct one."

"Dad's got all the wards up anyway and we're talking about putting it under Fidelius." Bill added. "But as the target is Harry…" he shrugged.

"Which leads us onto how someone knew Harry was going to be at the Burrow." Amelia set her tea aside. "Unfortunately, it only takes one slip of the tongue or one overheard conversation from a parent or a guest for someone to have known. I'm not certain it's worth tracking down who might have let it slip to others and what those others might have let slip to more people…"

"The fact is that we might never know who was overheard or who told the wrong person." Remus said. "Just a brief conversation with Arthur and Percy had them admitting that they'd both told their direct colleagues – Percy had informed Barty Crouch in an update to him and Arthur had mentioned they were having a party for Harry to his assistant Perkins." He motioned at Sirius. "And we can't throw stones either; we mentioned the party in front of Lawrence, Caro and Bertie earlier, and such information probably isn't covered by the confidentiality vow they took for their Treasure Team duties."

Sirius's anger mutated to chagrin. Remus was right; they had all been sloppy.

"Add to that the fact that the Burrow isn't under Fidelius which may have prevented the location being known even if someone spoke of the party…" Amelia shrugged. "Most of Arthur's colleagues have visited the Burrow at one time or another. Most of the Wizengamot knows where the Burrow is since many families live in the area. It's not a secure location."

"My Mum didn't really give Sirius and Harry a choice." Bill commented before Sirius could retort.

"I've stayed there before and nobody's sent me a threat." Harry pointed out with impeccable logic.

"True," Amelia allowed, "but unfortunately, the political atmosphere is tense and with the Dark Mark strengthening…"

"Someone decided to make a move." Minerva surmised with a frown.

"Possibly," Amelia sighed. "My best guess is that the note was sent by a Death Eater as a way to curry favour with his Master. Maybe as a response to the Mark darkening and twinging recently. Upset the birthday of the Boy Who Lived, create a bit of fear."

"But?" prompted Sirius.

"We checked in with the Rat Squad and none of the tagged Death Eaters sent the owl." Remus reported.

"We do know of one Death Eater who isn't tagged." Sirius said. "Dumbledore's spy." Dumbledore had flat out refused to have Severus tagged even to give him cover.

Remus's eyebrows shot up. "Severus may not like Harry but I don't see him sending a threatening note; it's not his style."

"I agree with Remus." Minerva said. "I can't see him doing something so petty."

"He takes points off me for breathing," Harry replied dryly, "*I* think he could be petty enough to want to spoil my birthday – especially the first one I'm spending with Sirius."

Bill cleared his throat. "Maybe it's his way of warning us that his Death Eater chums are getting frisky without being overt."

"He would have sent word through Albus." Remus argued. "I just don't see Severus as a viable suspect."

Sirius sniffed. He definitely saw Snivellus as a viable suspect.

"We should get Albus to check though." Amelia said. "We did do some checks on the parchment but all we found was a faint trace of house elf magic. Snape would have access to one at Hogwarts."

"The house elf thing would also seemingly rule out Pettigrew and Riddle." Bill said.

"Not necessarily." Sirius said. "They could be staying with someone with a house elf."

"Our surveillance hasn't uncovered any sign of any Death Eater actually being in contact with either." Amelia argued.

"So either they're staying with someone we don't know and haven't got tagged or they've bought a house elf or it wasn't them." Sirius went through the various options.

"Peter wouldn't have sent something like this." Remus commented.

"I'm not sure we know Wormtail all that well enough to make a judgement," Sirius replied snappishly, "he did pull the wool over our eyes for years."

"It is like Tom to send something like that." Harry said, silencing the room very effectively.

Sirius swallowed his pumpkin juice and wished it was Firewhiskey.

"Couldn't someone have used their house elf to send the letter even if you did tag them?" Harry asked, breaking the quiet.

"That's true too." Amelia said. "We can't tag the house elves. The magic won't stick to them."

"So we really don't have any idea who sent it." Sirius concluded.

"No." Amelia admitted with embarrassment. "All we can do officially is advise you to be on your guard and take sensible precautions."

"Well, thanks for trying to find out anyway." Harry sighed and turned to Sirius. "Can we go home?"

Sirius nodded. "Like Harry said, thank you, Amelia." He stood up with Harry.

"I'll see you at home." Remus said.

"Happy Birthday, Harry." Bill said as a goodbye and Minerva echoed it with a small smile.

"Thanks, everyone." Harry smiled tiredly and Sirius ushered him out and to the floo.

They had just stepped out of the floo when Harry hugged him unexpectedly.

"Thank you, Padfoot. This was still my best birthday ever." Harry said.

Sirius tightened his hold, too choked up to speak. Finally, Harry broke away and made for the stairs. Sirius watched him go and swiped at his damp eyes, furious at the Dursleys and Dumbledore all over again that a birthday that included a hunt for a horcrux and a death threat could possibly be seen to be Harry's best ever.

o-O-o

"Did you really receive a death threat on your birthday?"

Harry was glad he hadn't taken a sip of his drink or he might have choked.

"Really, Jeremy?" Susan snapped. "That's what you're leading with?"

The fifth year Ravenclaw and Heir to the Ancient and Noble House of Branstone sighed. "Our parents and or guardians have stuffed us into this room to get to know Potter better because of the new alliance. I assumed that meant we were allowed to ask questions, Bones."

Harry sneaked a look around the rest of the room – sixteen Heirs of varying ages from twelve to twenty and five related siblings of a similar age. The large conservatory of Longbottom Manor just about held the space for them all and the tea table set out with drinks and cookies. He tried to bear up under the collective weight of so many eyes. He was Lord Potter, Heir to the House of Black, he reminded himself. He had a duty to get to know everyone and at least he knew Neville, Susan and Hannah who had all grouped around him protectively. He glanced at Bill, another Heir in attendance that he knew; but Bill was there in service to the House of Potter as a guard for Harry and the House of Weasley wasn't formally part of the old Potter alliance.

"It's OK, Susan," Harry smiled at her gratefully though, "I don't mind answering."

Neville shifted beside him. "So long as people remember that you don't have to answer anything you don't want to – none of us do."

Jeremy nodded. "Fair enough."

Robert Ogden, a Hufflepuff who'd be entering his final year at Hogwarts that September and Tiberius's grandson, motioned at him. "So? Death threat? Yes or no?"

"Yes, there was an implied death threat on my birthday as the Prophet reported." Harry said. "No, I don't know what it said exactly. Sirius wouldn't tell me."

"You don't seem that freaked out." Alicia Doge said quietly. She was the oldest, a grand-niece of Elphias and his only living relative.

"I'm a target." Harry said bluntly. "Thanks to this." He lifted his fringe and revealed his scar.

"Are the rumours true about you killing Quirrell?" asked Terry Stebbins, eighteen, newly graduated and a Chaser for the Brighton Broomflyers. Harry had been hoping to talk to him about Quidditch.

Twelve year old Connor Sapworthy dropped his glass.

"Terry!" Albert Marchbanks, nineteen, and related to Griselda in a fourth cousin twice removed kind of way that made Harry's head hurt, dealt with the mess while Marcus Belby poured Connor another drink.

Michael Corner cleared his throat. "It's a valid question. I mean, we are supposed to be following the House of Potter and we need to know if, well, uh…"

"I killed someone?" asked Harry dryly.

"Yes." Michael said.

"Well, we already know he killed someone! He killed You-Know-Who," pointed out Lydia Inglebee, smiling at Harry sweetly while her twin brother, the Heir, made a gagging gesture behind her; they were both a year behind Harry at Hogwarts, "and he's a hero. If he killed Quirrell it's because he was a Dark Wizard."

"Quirrell?" Robert snorted. "He couldn't find his own arse without stuttering!"

Connor dropped his glass again.

Bill walked over and spelled the glass impermeable. He cast a look at Harry that asked if he needed help but Harry shook his head a touch to decline. As much as he wanted to tell Michael and Terry to shove it, they had a point. And he had to get used to dealing with these types of questions; he'd already had variants of them at the dinners with the Heads of their Houses although Sirius usually ran interference.

"Quirrell was possessed. That's what killed him according to the Headmaster." Harry said simply. "My friends and I just stopped possessed-him being able to steal something from the school."

"It was still very brave of you to go after him." Lydia said – and was she actually fluttering her eyelashes at him?

"Actually my friends and I thought it was Snape." Harry admitted sheepishly.

Terry grinned and raised his glass to him. "Balls of steel then! Not many of us would have faced him down!"

"I'm sure after You-Know-Who Snape is nothing." Lydia said.

Harry shot Neville a 'save me' look but it was Susan who stepped in.

"I'm sure Harry doesn't want to dwell." Susan said sharply enough that Harry was reminded of her aunt.

"Do you remember that night when you offed You-Know-Who?" asked Michael.

Harry felt the horror and revulsion of having to even think about that night arrow through him again but before he could respond…

"Corner!" Bill's hard voice resounded across the room. "That's enough!"

"Exactly," Neville glared at Michael, "you wouldn't ask me if I remember the night my parents were tortured so why would you ask Harry that?"

Michael went bright red and he muttered an apology.

But Robert scowled at Bill. "We are supposed to be getting to know him, Weasley."

"Getting to know him, yes, *Ogden*." Bill said with the same hardness to his tone that warned the boy not to push him. "Satisfying your prurient curiosity about certain events in his life, no." He pointed his wand at Harry. "For instance, nobody's asked him about what he fancies doing as a career. Or what his favourite subject is. Or what his views on the Quidditch league are."

The group turned in a mostly chastised mass back to Harry who shot Bill a look of thanks.

"And there was I thinking we'd gotten rid of the Harry guards." Terry said in a loud whisper.

"Guards?" asked Harry confused.

"Ron and Hermione." Neville supplied.

Susan nodded. "They're very protective over you."

"Although," Neville said, glaring at Michael again, "if that's the type of crap questions you have to put up, who can blame them."

"I said sorry!" Michael retorted huffily.

"I guess they are quite protective of me." Harry acknowledged, thinking of his two friends. "The first few months at Hogwarts everybody kept staring at me, and in second year, there was the whole thing about me being a parselmouth."

"Yeah, sorry about that." Susan exchanged an embarrassed look with Hannah.

"I think parseltongue sounds sexy." Lydia said, inching closer.

Harry tried to shake the feeling of being trapped. "It all sounds like English to me."

"Really?" Michael asked. "That's fascinating. I read a book that theorised that parseltongue couldn't be taught because it was a magical interpretative charm that Salazar keyed to his blood that automatically changed the hissing into speech. It sounds like the book might be right."

"But wouldn't that make Harry the Heir of Slytherin?" Hannah argued. "And didn't we establish he wasn't?"

"Tom Riddle is the Heir of Slytherin." Harry said firmly. "Otherwise known as Voldemort."

Many in the room flinched.

"We think when he attacked me there was a magical transference because of this." Harry explained, once again lifting his fringe and revealing the faint scar.

"I wish I could talk to snakes." Connor piped up. "We have a garden snake that lives under the apple tree."

"The first snake I talked to was a boa constrictor at a zoo." Harry told him, grateful for Connor's intervention. "He was very bored at just being stared at all day."

"Did he say anything else?" asked Connor, his brown eyes shining with curiosity.

"Well, he thanked me for freeing him although I didn't really mean to." Harry said with a small laugh. "My cousin pushed me and I accidentally magicked the glass away from the snake's enclosure."

There were quite a few chuckles in the room.

"How was it growing up with muggles?" Robert asked, toying with his empty glass.

Harry tensed again at the question but forced himself into giving a shrug. "OK. I prefer living with Sirius."

"I guess it gives you a unique insight, doesn't it?" Alicia said, thinking out loud. "You're the Head of a powerful Ancient and Noble House who effectively knows what it's like to be a muggleborn in the wizarding world."

"I guess." Harry said doubtfully.

"OK," Albert said, "now it's getting interesting. What are your thoughts on being muggleborn in wizarding society?"

Harry glanced at Neville who gave him an encouraging look, one that said he'd back Harry up. This was the kind of the thing they'd debated in Sirius's politics lessons. He took a deep breath.

"I think it's harder than it needs to be." He waved a hand to stop anyone interrupting. "My relatives were afraid of magic so they didn't tell me what my accidents were and I thought, well, I thought I was a freak." He blushed hard but ignored the heat on his cheeks to continue. "Now, my relatives knew it was magic but didn't tell me because they were scared. The parents of normal muggleborns probably don't know though so there's no way of reassuring their kids."

"You think we should get involved earlier then? As soon as accidental magic is detected?" Albert questioned.

"Won't that endanger the Statute of Secrecy more?" argued Robert.

"I would say it would protect it more," Neville chipped in confidently, "if we provide early assistance, we provide reassurance and can help the parents ensure other instances are kept to a minimum."

"And we can help prepare them for entering the wizarding world better." Harry warmed up to his argument. "I was really overwhelmed when I was told so I didn't know what to ask and everything was very confusing."

"Muggleborns get the introduction booklet don't they?" Robert said dismissively. "That should be enough."

"The booklet isn't very good." Hannah spoke up. "I'm a halfblood because Mum's muggleborn and she showed me her copy. It's an outline of the government set-up, the directions to Diagon Alley and Saint Mungo's, and then mostly about Hogwarts but then it's just the classes and a brief history."

"Is that all? That's appalling!" Michael said. "There should be a proper book…"

"We and Hermione were thinking primary schools for wizarding children." Harry said, pointing at himself and Neville. It had been the idea they'd come up with during their last politics session.

Albert smirked. "I see it didn't take long for the Houses of Potter and Longbottom to regain their former closeness."

"We stand together as always." Neville said simply.

"And besides Neville and I godbrothers." Harry added, defensively. "We're practically family."

"I like the idea of a wizarding primary school." Hannah said. "My Mum made me go to a muggle one and it was great. If we had a wizarding one, I think that would be marvellous."

"Maybe one day Abbott, Granger, Longbottom and Potter will be to primary education what Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, Gryffindor and Slytherin are to secondary." Alicia teased.

Harry smiled back at her. "I can think of worst things to do with my life."

"What do you fancy doing as a career?" Terry asked, butting into the conversation.

Harry darted a look at Terry. "I haven't really decided but I was thinking Quidditch player or broom racer."

"Oh, you'd be brilliant!" Terry said immediately.

"I don't know if I'm that good." Harry said modestly.

"You're the youngest seeker in a century." Jeremy pointed out. "And you're undefeated – well, apart from that match against Diggory but that wasn't your fault. You're likely to get try-outs by seventh year if you continue."

"I think that would be a marvellous career! You look smashing in your Quidditch gear." Lydia exclaimed, flicking her long blonde hair over her shoulder.

Susan sent her a dirty look. "Harry could do a lot more good staying in politics or becoming an Auror."

"Is that what you want to do Susan?" Harry asked quickly, taking the opportunity presented to throw off attention from himself.

"I was thinking law." Susan replied.

Harry's questioning gaze went to Hannah who blushed. "Healer, probably."

Robert shifted as Harry looked at him. "I'll be taking over Ogden's. Firewhiskey doesn't make itself."

"I was thinking of the Ministry. I'd like to get into the DOM as a researcher." Jeremy said.

"I'm a mediwitch at Saint Mungo's." Alicia supplied.

Everyone else chimed in and the range of careers and ambitions was impressive and gave Harry food for thought about his own future.

Lydia had waited until last. "I'm going to be a wife and mother."

Her brother dropped his head into his hands.

"Well, that's a valid choice." Alicia said kindly. "Motherhood is a wonderful thing." She glanced at Harry and winked at him. "Are you going to be arranged, Harry?"

Harry avoided Lydia's stare and shook his head at Alicia. "Sirius said my Mum would come back and hex him. He's giving everyone the freedom to choose for themselves."

"So that's why Parkinson's arrangement with Malfoy was dissolved?" Michael asked. "You know she's furious."

"She probably sent the death threat!" joked Jeremy.

Harry smiled. He wished it had been Pansy but he suspected it was Tom.

"So you're not arranged to the Granger girl then?" asked Lydia bluntly. "Because you've been seen *everywhere* with her this summer."

Harry frowned at the slight to Hermione. "She's with me because she's my best friend and she's under the sponsorship of the House of Black."

"My Dad said Lord Black announced it at the July Session." Terry said. "Said it was a repayment of a life debt."

There was a hint of a question and Harry nodded. "She helped me save Sirius from the Dementors at Hogwarts."

"So she got sponsorship?" sniffed Lydia.

"That's our plan B." Neville said. "If we don't get a wizarding primary school system, then more families sponsoring muggleborns would be the way to go."

Harry smiled his thanks at Neville for turning the conversation back to the muggleborn discussion.

"Does it really make that much of a difference?" Michael asked, genuine interest colouring his words.

Harry nodded. "Hermione's parents said that they didn't know what to ask when Professor McGonagall turned up. They're very happy since Andy has been sponsoring Hermione because they have someone they can talk to and who will help them understand things."

"My Gran is thinking of sponsoring a muggleborn now. If all the houses did it…" Neville said.

"Yes, but sponsorship is a serious business." Albert remarked. "There is a commitment involved. Not every House is as well-placed to offer sanctuary and protection as the Houses of Black, Potter and Longbottom."

"Maybe not." Neville countered. "But we could time limit the sponsorship to the school years or even simply their introductory year."

"I think it's a good idea." Hannah said. "I might ask Dad to look into it. Mum would go for it for sure."

"I agree," Jeremy said, "I think it's a splendid idea."

"Count me in." Alicia said enthusiastically.

"Speaking of life debts," Michael threw a look towards Bill, "is there another one to be announced?"

Harry looked at Bill seeking his permission.

Bill cleared his throat. "You're right, Corner. I'm sworn to serve the House of Potter to repay the life debt between Harry and my sister."

"So that story of you saving Ginny Weasley in the Chamber of Secrets is true?" Jeremy whistled.

"She's my best mate's sister!" Harry said quickly. "I'm sure any of you would have done the same."

"I think it was terribly heroic!" Lydia said on cue.

Harry smiled tightly.

"When you think about it we all owe you a life debt." Michael said idly, waving his cookie in the air. "You know for offing You-Know-Who."

Connor fumbled his glass but kept hold of it. Harry offered him a smile and Connor grinned back at him triumphantly.

"He's right." Jeremy said.

"I don't think life debts work that way," Harry said diplomatically, "and we think both my Mum and my Dad helped me."

"It doesn't change the main principle though, does it?" Albert questioned thoughtfully. "We all owe the House of Potter. It sacrificed its Head, its Lady and almost its entire line to keep us safe." He frowned.

Harry squirmed uncomfortably.

"But isn't that why we're in the alliance?" asked Robert.

"We're in the alliance because they think He's coming back according to my Mum." Connor said with honest naivety.

Harry's heart just about sank and he examined the shocked expressions on most of the Heirs' faces. Neville looked determined – he knew most of it straight from Harry – and Albert, Susan, Hannah and Alicia weren't wearing looks of surprise.

"Is that true?" demanded Robert.

Susan shook her head. "No, we would all be in the alliance anyway according to my father. I overheard him telling Hannah's Dad that they're all a bit bemused by how they let the alliance slip just because the House of Potter was, uh…"

"Out of action?" Alicia suggested quietly.

"So You-Know-Who isn't dead?" asked Jeremy, leaning forward intently.

All eyes turned to Harry. Harry glanced at Bill again for direction; the eldest Weasley gave another encouraging nod.

"The night he attacked my parents and I," Harry said haltingly, deciding that if he and the group around him were going to work together he needed to be honest but he knew Sirius wouldn't be pleased if he told them everything, "he did die kind-of. He lost his body anyway. But he's done some magic to keep his spirit around like a wraith. We think Pettigrew is helping him get a new body."

"So the death threat was from him?" Jeremy asked shocked.

Connor looked terrified.

Harry sighed. "Maybe or maybe from one of his followers. It doesn't matter."

"That's very brave of you!" cooed Lydia.

"It's not brave…" Harry said immediately, "it's just…I've faced him a few times now and…"

"How?"

"When?"

The voices all merged until Neville yelled for people to be quiet.

Harry looked at his friend in shock. Who knew Neville could be that assertive? "Uh, thanks, Neville."

Neville nodded briskly.

"Look," Harry said, turning his attention back to the crowd, "Voldemort was a halfblood called Tom Marvolo Riddle, the son of a witch and a muggle. He was an orphan and he was picked on by others in the muggle orphanage where he lived so he started to use his magic to protect himself. He went to Hogwarts back when Dippet was Headmaster and Tom became the Head Boy. All Tom wanted was power."

Harry couldn't see himself so he couldn't see how his green eyes gleamed with determination, his face shining with passion, a natural charisma to lead unfurling as the others listened to him spill the secrets of the most feared Dark Lord of the wizarding world.

"He knew the power was held by the pureblood families so he gathered followers who espoused a pureblood agenda and his hatred of muggles helped him say the right things and talk the same language so they believed him. And soon he had a group of very powerful friends. But Tom wanted more power so he took himself off and when he came back he'd reinvented himself as Lord Voldemort, the Heir of Slytherin, and hardly anyone remembered Tom Riddle and those that did were sworn to secrecy." Harry continued.

"Why doesn't everyone know this?" asked Jeremy.

"I don't know." Harry answered honestly. "Anyway, my point is that Tom isn't any different to any of us. He was a student once; he had friends. He just got power hungry."

"And turned into a very powerful Dark Lord." Robert pointed out. "It was said that even Dumbledore wasn't able to beat him."

"I've beaten him." Harry pointed out. "I beat him when I was a baby – and yes, my Mum and Dad helped but he was still driven out of his body. I beat him when he possessed Quirrell," Harry continued, ignoring the sudden looks of understanding, "and he tried killing me three times that year – four if you count the troll he let into the school. I beat him when he reopened the Chamber, took Ginny and turned his basilisk on me. And all that time part of my power was bound!" He gestured. "I've been lucky," he admitted, "but I don't want you to think he's unbeatable because that's not true. I mean, if Voldemort turned up right now and we all stuck together, we could beat him or at least drive him off!"

"Even me?" asked Connor wide-eyed.

"All of us." Harry said again firmly.

"Well, that's the point of the alliance, isn't it?" Jeremy said suddenly. "We all stick together and don't let him win!"

"But that's politics!" Robert argued.

"Which is half the battle." Albert pointed out. "If we hold the power in the Ministry and the Wizengamot, he loses ground."

"If he turns up with a body, we're still going to have to fight him though, aren't we?" Robert pointed out.

"Maybe we will," Susan allowed, "but Harry's right; if everyone stuck together, we could drive him off."

"And we have Harry." Lydia added.

Harry blushed.

"Are you that powerful?" asked Robert bluntly. "I mean joking about basilisks and Quirrell and rumours aside?"

Harry debated for a moment and sighed. "If I show you something, you can't tell anyone, OK?"

Everyone nodded.

Harry took out his wand and pointed it at the empty space beside him. "Expecto Patronum!"

Prongs clattered out of his wand and onto the tiles of the conservatory. He was solid again although Harry had tried dialling back his power. There were exclamations of wonder and awe. Connor snuck up to the stag and patted him gently.

"Merlin! He's solid." Alicia said as she reached over and touched Prongs. "This is incredible."

Prongs snorted.

"Why do you need us if you're this powerful?" asked Robert, his eyes glued to the stag which turned to give him a dirty look – he wasn't the only one.

Neville glared at him. "You'd leave an ally alone on the battlefield with an enemy? If Harry has to fight You-Know – Voldemort! – I will stand beside him."

"As will I," declared Susan.

A round of agreements filled the air as Harry gave the command for Prongs to depart.

"Hopefully none of us will have to fight Tom." Harry said loudly. "Sirius and your parents and guardians are doing everything they can so we don't have to, so it doesn't end up in all-out war like last time." He worried his lip a little before he charged on with his words. "But thank you for your support – all of you. It means a lot." It was a tad overwhelming and he didn't really want them to fight alongside him in truth; he'd rather they stayed safe.

There was a semi-awkward silence.

Harry cleared his throat as he realised it was probably up to him to smooth things over. "So, who's going to the Quidditch World Cup final?"

Terry shot him a grateful look and raised his hand. "Me!"

The conversation turned to other things and by the time Sirius came to collect Harry, they were fiercely debating witches' rights to inherit Wizengamot seats and Alicia was half a phrase away from hexing Robert much to Harry's amusement.
