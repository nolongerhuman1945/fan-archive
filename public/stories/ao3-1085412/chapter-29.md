"Time's up!"

Harry set his quill down and massaged his cramping right hand with his left. He breathed in deeply the way Healer Fay had instructed; his magic responded to his call and healed the strained muscles. He instantly felt better and took another breath as the Runes teacher, Professor Bathsheda Babbling, took his completed parchments with a bright sunny smile. She reminded him a little of Hermione; wild chestnut hair, kind brown eyes and an intelligent face.

"Ah, excellent, Mister Potter." Professor Babbling said happily. "I'll have these back to you by the end of the day."

Harry nodded nervously. It was the first test he had sat since Sirius had assumed guardianship of him, and beyond the goal of getting into fourth year Runes, he also wanted desperately to have done well. The test had been really long though and the questions towards the end included deciphering runes in strange combinations that he and Sirius hadn't covered in their tutoring. Maybe the syllabus had changed since Sirius had been a student, Harry thought ruefully. But hopefully, hopefully, he had done enough.

Professor Babbling dismissed him briskly and Harry gathered up his things and exited the classroom. Padfoot waited for him in the corridor and Harry made for the dog, giving him a hug before stepping back so Sirius could transform back into a man.

"Well, don't keep me in suspenders!" Sirius said urgently. "How did it go?"

Harry smiled at Sirius's obvious interest. "I think I did OK. There were a lot of questions for an end of year exam and some of the combinations at the end we hadn't covered."

Sirius frowned. "Did you break down the combination and work them out though like..."

"Like you taught me." Harry nodded. "I think I got tangled up on one and I'm pretty sure I said the Norse rune for healing was for blessing in another but…" he heaved a sigh, "I think I did enough to get in the class?"

"Good. Excellent work." Sirius said, slinging an arm around his shoulder and prompting Harry to walk toward the Great Hall. "Everyone else should be gathered for lunch. We'll have a quick bite to eat and then it's off to the Chamber of Horrors."

Harry smiled. The quiet return to the Chamber to search for another one of the objects Voldemort had left behind like the diary had turned into a huge undertaking to maintain the cover story. Some of it, Harry admitted to himself, was his fault as he had asked for Ron to come along. Bill had agreed but in convincing his mother, somehow the condition had been set that the Weasley matriarch and Ginny should attend too. According to Ron, Ginny had "gone mental" demanding that if anyone should be allowed to return it should be her and, after some discussion with Madame Pomfrey, it had been decided it would be beneficial for Ginny to face her demons.

In addition to the Weasleys, Sirius had gained agreement from the Grangers to allow Hermione to attend and the Headmaster in announcing that they were recovering the basilisk had found himself with an influx of volunteers from the excited Hogwarts staff, all wanting to catch a glimpse of the infamous Chamber. Minerva, Hagrid, Professor Flitwick, Professor Snape, Professor Sprout and the new DADA Professor Alastor Moody were all coming along. A contingent of Gringotts Creature Specialists had also been hired for the basilisk removal and rendering. With the treasure team, Bertie, Sirius and Remus, Harry felt they had enough people that even the massive Chamber he remembered was going to feel cramped.

The Hall was bustling with people when Sirius and Harry entered. A long table had been laid out in the centre and everybody was milling about with beverages. The house elves were popping in and out with canapés, looking immensely thrilled to be busy.

"Harry!" Hermione came rushing up with Ron trailing behind her. "How did you do? Did you manage all of the questions? Were they hard? Did you answer the essay question on Norse or Celtic runes? I did Norse but after the exam I thought I should have done Celtic and…"

"Blimey, Hermione!" Ron interrupted as both Sirius and Harry started chortling at the stream of questions. "Give the bloke a chance!"

Hermione blushed but crossed her arms and pinned Ron with a glare. "You're not even interested!"

"It's an exam!" Ron retorted. "One I didn't have to do! Of course, I'm not interested!" He suddenly seemed to realise that his words could be offensive to Harry and winced visibly. "Sorry, mate!"

Harry shrugged. He doubted he would be that interested in an exam Ron did that he didn't have to sit for. "It was OK," he said in reply to Hermione, "yes, I managed all the questions but only just in the time, some of them were really hard and I did the first essay question on Norse runes and the second one on Celtic."

Hermione frowned. "My exam only had one essay question."

"Maybe she added some questions to test me more since she didn't teach me it and this is to prove I have the knowledge to get into fourth year." Harry theorised. There had been a *lot* of questions. His stomach growled.

"Lunch time." Sirius said firmly, leading him to the table.

"You should try these little sausages on sticks," Ron said enthusiastically, "they're brilliant!"

Hermione sniffed. "You'll ruin your appetite eating all those before lunch."

"Your appetite, maybe," Ron shot back, "mine no way!"

"Well, that's because you're a growing boy." Molly said, walking up to join them. She gave Harry a light hug. "Glad to hear it went well, dear. Sit down and have your lunch."

It appeared that with Sirius and Harry both seated at the table, everyone else began to wander over and in no time at all, the table was filled.

Sirius sat one side of Harry with Hermione on the other. Ron sat across from Harry in between his Mum and Ginny. Remus ended up next to Sirius, Bill next to Ginny. The Professors grouped together at the head of the table where the Headmaster sat presiding over everyone. The rest of the treasure team, Bertie and the Gringotts' Creature Specialist team (two Goblins named Footlock and Brimbold, an old wizard named Casper that Bill had greeted happily and a young wizard called Aontius who was Bulgarian and a Gringotts' intern) gathered together at the bottom.

A lively debate broke out about the imminent Quidditch World cup with Aontius defending Bulgaria and Bill taking the side of Ireland. Ron chipped in on Aontius's side surprising his brother. Viktor Krum, the Bulgarian seeker, according to Ron, was the best seeker in the entire world.

Harry took part enough to contribute his own point of view that Ireland had the better Chaser formation before turning and engaging Hermione in a conversation about why she'd wanted to do the essay on Celtic runes rather than the Norse as she had done. Remus and Sirius were happy to debate the relative merits with both of them and since it had the added benefit of preventing Sirius from glaring at Snape every few minutes it was all to the good. The initial meeting between the two hadn't gone well…

*Harry smiled as he stepped out of the floo without stumbling and into the Headmaster's office.*

*Remus was already there and waved his wand to clear him of soot. "You're getting better at floo travel, Harry."*

"*He couldn't get much worse." Snape sneered, drawing Harry's attention to his presence. Snape was lurking at the back of the office by a bookcase.*

*Dumbledore smiled widely. "Now, Severus, it does take everyone some time to get used to travelling by floo."*

*Harry exchanged a look with Remus but thankfully Sirius arrived, stepping out of the floo with a poised grace and elegance that Andy had promised Harry he would one day achieve for himself.*

*Sirius smiled at Harry before his eyes caught on Snape and his expression lost all semblance of good humour. "Snape."*

"*Black."*

"*What's he doing here?" Sirius asked sharply.*

"*As our Potions Master, Severus is helping with the basilisk." Dumbledore said mildly but Harry could hear the rebuke in Dumbledore's tone at Sirius's question. "He, of course, is also aware of the real reason for our descent into the Chamber today."*

"*I still don't know why I have to suffer the presence of the man who tried to feed me to a Dementor!" Sirius snapped.*

*Snape bristled and took a step forward, hands clenching into fists at his side. "You tried to feed me to a werewolf!"*

"*You tried to feed yourself to a werewolf!" Sirius retorted.*

"*The werewolf in question would like to point out that he prefers a nice steak." Remus inserted, subtly placing himself beside Harry protectively.*

*Harry couldn't help but chuckle.*

*Snape glared at him. "I suppose you think that's funny, Potter?"*

"*Everyone except you thinks it's funny including the phoenix!" Sirius said, and he was right; Fawkes was amused. Sirius put a protective hand on Harry's shoulder.*

"*I don't have to stand here and be insulted by you!" Snape snarled, his wand appearing in his hand.*

*Sirius moved in a blink and his wand was out and pointed at Snape. "Bring it on, Snape. We might as well duel now and get it over with because I don't see you having the self-control to actually treat Harry with decency and civility and I won't stand for you bullying him!"*

"*You and your little group bullied me for years and you know it!" Snape sneered.*

"*I don't deny it." Sirius said, taking the wind out of Snape's sails in a major way if the blank look of shock on Snape's face was anything to go by. "Oh yes, Snape. I've been honest with Harry about the mistakes I've made and I've admitted to him that I'm not proud of how we behaved with you. But when we bullied you, Snape, we were all the same age and perhaps it wasn't fair, four on one, but it was a damn sight fairer than a grown man picking on a child who can't even remember the man you hate him for looking like!"*

*Snape glowered angrily. "I have a role to play, something you would know nothing about."*

"*Don't try to justify your atrocious behaviour as a teacher because you're a spy!" Sirius snapped. "And I know exactly what it means to play a role with Death Eaters! I was undercover for almost six months with a pack of them on the continent. So don't give me that!"*

"*Gentlemen!" Dumbledore said loudly, finally rising from his chair to intervene. "Sirius, please; we are all on the same side."*

"*I'm not too sure about that." Sirius growled, anger turning his grey eyes stormy.*

"*Severus has my complete trust…" Dumbledore began.*

"*And no-one else's." But Sirius lowered his wand and Snape put his away with a haughty sniff.*

*Remus gave a small sigh and Harry looked at him surprised, realising how tense Remus had been about the confrontation.*

*Sirius gave Snape a glare. "I'm only going to say this once,* *Professor* *Snape; I hear of one incident that involves you being less than professional in regards to Harry and I will ruin you. Don't think you can hide behind Albus's robes; not even he will be able to protect you."*

*Snape's nostrils flared in anger. "You think just because you're* *Lord* *Black now you can get away with threatening me?"*

"*It's not a threat, Professor," Sirius smiled humourlessly, "it's a promise. That, and the fact that I'll be assuming my place on the Board of Governors and will be keeping a close watch on the teaching standards here at Hogwarts."*

*Snape gave an incoherent snarl of fury and stormed out of the room, his robes billowing behind him.*

"*I had so hoped a private meeting would have given you an opportunity to put aside your differences and agree to work together." Dumbledore remonstrated.*

"*Firstly, if that was your intent, you should have forewarned me of a meeting and it certainly didn't look like Snape got the memo on your agenda," Sirius snapped, "and secondly, I'll put aside my differences when he apologises to Harry for being a complete bastard and…" he stopped himself abruptly, "and other things." He held up a hand when Dumbledore went to speak. "Keep your pet spy on a leash or I will do exactly what I promised, Headmaster."*

"*Well, I never," Phineas Nigellus said from his portrait, "speaking to the Headmaster in such a disrespectful tone and…"*

"*Your Lord Black commands you to silence!" Sirius turned around and snapped at the portrait which immediately shut up, bound by the Black family magic to follow the order.*

*Harry shifted uncertainly by Sirius's side, knowing that something in the confrontation with Snape had upset Sirius hugely as had Dumbledore's defence of the Potions Professor. He placed a hand on Sirius's arm comfortingly. "Headmaster, is Professor Babbling waiting in her office for me?"*

"*The Runes classroom, Harry." Dumbledore smiled at him, evidently appreciative of Harry's attempt to change the subject.*

"*We'd best be making a move then." Sirius agreed, taking Harry's cue and running with it.*

"*I'll stay and go over the details of when everyone else is arriving with Albus." Remus promised with a fond smile for Harry. "Good luck!"*

All in all Harry was relieved that Snape was down at the other end of the table from Sirius. He appreciated Sirius sticking up for him but he truly didn't think it was going to make any difference to Snape's behaviour. But it felt good to know there was someone who would stand up for him. If he'd told his aunt or uncle about Snape's behaviour they would have just told him he deserved it.

Harry set his spoon down as he finished his dessert and caught sight of Ginny's pale face. He wondered if it really was the best thing for her to face the Chamber. He had to admit his own nerves had started up with his exam out of the way.

"Ladies and Gentlemen," Dumbledore stood up and smiled benevolently down the length of the table, "thank you all for coming today. This is a special occasion. We all have the honour of descending into Slytherin's Chamber of Secrets. Our primary objective today is to recover the basilisk which Harry killed in self-defence when rescuing Miss Weasley. We have the help of our esteemed visitors from Gringotts led by Goblin Master Brimbold. Half of the revenue will be donated to a new trust for the maintenance of Hogwarts including purchase of new teaching equipment, books and supplies; it will be known as the Phoenix Trust and will be administered by the Potter steward. The rest of the revenue will be split in various amounts between all those affected by the basilisk and her master including: the family of Myrtle Bootle, Rubeus Hagrid, Argus Filch, Colin Creevey, Justin Finch-Fletchley, Penelope Clearwater, Hermione Granger, Ronald and Ginevra Weasley. Oh, and there will be a new perch for Fawkes in recognition of his bravery and assistance in defeating the basilisk along with a small donation to St Mungo's for the on-going care and treatment of Gilderoy Lockhart. On behalf of the school, I would like to thank Harry for his generosity."

There was a small round of applause which had Harry blushing. His discussion with Sirius about how to divide the basilisk revenue had been an interesting one. He had debated endlessly about Fawkes and Lockhart: the former because Harry placed a lot of emphasis on the role the phoenix had played in helping him, and the latter because as much as Lockhart was an obliviating fraud, Lockhart had only been down in the tunnel because Harry and Ron had forced him into it. In essence the trust to the school was recognition of the phoenix's major contribution since Harry couldn't exactly gift the money to Fawkes personally. He'd also debated about the Weasleys since they hadn't been harmed by the basilisk so much as its master; Ginny had been rather silly writing in the diary but then hadn't Harry done the same? And Ron...well, Harry firmly believed that Ron deserved something for braving his demons and going into the forest; for his want to rescue Ginny even if he'd ended up on the wrong side of the cave-in. Still the Weasleys' share was very small compared to those that had been petrified and Harry was content he'd made the right decision to give them something.

"Now, while I'm sure we're all excited about visiting the Chamber," Dumbledore continued, "I must remind everyone that although there is no longer a basilisk protecting it, there may be other dangers. Salazar Slytherin was a very cunning and powerful wizard and it is unlikely that the basilisk was the only protection. We may also come across artefacts from Slytherin and these may also be dangerous. Therefore, our underage students today must remain with an adult at all times, and I would encourage the adults to allow our specialist curse-breakers to lead the way."

Harry glanced at Sirius who gave him an encouraging wink. They had already discussed Harry remaining with Sirius and following the same rules as the expedition to get the ring.

"Well, if we're all done with lunch, may I suggest we make final preparations and gather in ten minutes for Harry to lead us to the Chamber." Dumbledore finished.

There was an immediate scramble for the loo. Before too long Harry found himself in another familiar bathroom.

"You came back!" Myrtle appeared with a splash from a toilet and Harry shot Sirius a 'don't you dare tease me in front of everybody' look.

"I did, Myrtle," Harry said, politely, "we're all going to see the Chamber, do you want to come with us?"

"Oh no!" Myrtle shook her head. "We ghosts can't go down there!"

"Fascinating." Dumbledore murmured behind him.

"A ghost ward of some kind?" Bertie offered as an explanation.

Harry crouched down and set his eyes on the small squiggle that represented a snake. "*Open*." He hissed.

The sink moved aside just as he remembered and the long steep slide revealed itself.

"Try asking for stairs." Bertie said quickly before Harry could move. "I doubt Slytherin would slide down; far below his dignity."

Harry nodded, closed his eyes to conjure up a picture of a snake in his head and whispered the word 'stairs' in parseltongue.

The whole tunnel shimmered for a second before the top of the pipe was raised and steps appeared, roughly hewn and very steep but there.

"Oh, well done, Harry!" Dumbledore said.

"Right then!" Bill wriggled his way to the front. "Caro and I will go ahead."

"Be careful, William!" Molly called out.

Bill rolled his eyes at Harry as Caro smirked at him. Harry grinned and moved away from the opening. The Treasure Team, Bertie, the Creature Specialist team and most of the Professors all headed down before he and Sirius followed, the lumos spells lighting their way, Remus behind them with Hermione and Molly with Ginny and Ron.

Walking down took a *lot* longer than sliding and Harry was slightly out of breath by the time they reached the cave-in where Lockhart had tried to obliviate them. Someone had created balls of light that lit up the area, relieving the dark. Most of the group was working to clear the tunnel and shore it up to make it safe.

Harry stayed back to let them work but shivered suddenly as his mind started to churn with the memories of terror and horror and…

Sirius moved closer, wrapping an arm around him. "You OK?" He whispered.

Harry nodded, unable to speak and his eyes sought out Ron and Ginny. They looked as pale and frightened as he felt. Ginny was clinging to her mother; Ron looked milk white under his freckles.

"If you want out at any time, Harry, just say and we'll leave." Remus said quietly.

"It doesn't matter if we have to come back so no worries, alright?" Sirius added, supportively.

"Yeah," Harry managed with a small smile, "sorry, it's just…coming down here…I didn't realise it would bring it all back so much."

Remus nodded and catching Harry glance towards the Weasleys again, he smiled. "I'll go check on them."

Hermione's hand gently took hold of Harry's and he shifted his grip to hold hers in case she was feeling scared.

"I wish I'd been with you." She whispered.

"Me too." Harry replied, remembering how she'd helped him with all the traps with the Philosopher's stone. But at least she hadn't been hurt beyond the petrification. If she'd come with him and Ron, would she have ended up beside him fighting the basilisk or dead or…

"Wonderful!" Bertie's shout dragged Harry's attention to where everyone else was gathered.

Where there had once been a heap of rocks and stone stood a brand new archway built out of the rubble.

"That's a nice bit of transfiguration, Albus!" Bertie said.

Minerva nodded. "It'll hold for a good year or more."

"Would you give me an Outstanding then, Minerva?" teased Dumbledore, his eyes twinkling.

Snape rushed forward and started to examine the huge cast-off skin that lay on the other side of the archway.

Brimbold followed and turned to Harry. "How large is this beast?"

"I'm, uh, not sure of the size," admitted Harry, "but it was really big."

"I'd estimate around fifty to sixty feet based on Harry's memory; as thick as an ancient oak tree." Bertie said. "Harry, if you could, we're going to need you for the next bit."

They all carried on down the tunnel to the massive doors, a strange silence settling over the group.

Dumbledore turned around and held up his wand for attention. "It has been over a year since Harry defeated the basilisk so there is likely to be some decay. You may want to cover your mouths and noses until the smell has been dispersed."

"Here." Sirius handed Harry a handkerchief and conjured another for Hermione's use.

"There's a perfect spell called the Bubble Head charm for this type of situation but they don't teach it to us for another couple of years yet and, oh look! Professor Flitwick's demonstrating it." Hermione rambled in Harry's ear.

Harry looked at their Charms Professor and saw a strange translucent bubble surrounding his head.

"It's mainly meant to be used underwater like the old deep sea diving suits but an alternative use is in potions and as a supply of fresh air in spelunking." Hermione continued to ramble and Harry didn't object knowing it was her way of dealing with her nerves. "Of course, it is very unstable if cast inexpertly and can easily be disturbed which makes it very dangerous!"

There was a loud sob and they both turned to look at Ginny who was a trembling mess.

"That's it!" Molly declared as she rubbed Ginny's shoulders. "I'm taking you back up! I knew this was a bad idea."

"No…" Ginny sobbed. "I just…" her eyes snapped open and arrowed in on Harry. "Please, can I stay with Harry?"

Molly sent Harry a helpless look. Ron mouthed the word 'mental' at him.

Harry nodded reluctantly. He held out his free hand to Ginny who immediately rushed over and grasped it tightly. Hermione, who held his other hand, gave him a subtle squeeze of support.

"Well, since Harry's got his hands full, a handkerchief isn't going to work anymore so…" Sirius frowned. "Moony?"

"You always were hopeless at remembering the wand movements for the Bubble Head, Padfoot." Remus said, performing the magic so that a secure Bubble Head appeared around Harry. He did the same for Hermione and Ginny.

"Excellent work, Remus!" Professor Flitwick grinned at him.

Bill motioned for Harry to step forward and he whispered once again for the doors to open.

From the distressed sounds that the people with only handkerchiefs made, Harry was glad of the Bubble Head. Bill and Caro were both casting in unison and Professor Flitwick and Snape hurriedly moved alongside them to help.

It was Caro who gave the signal it was all clear and Harry felt the Bubble Head disappear, and wrinkled his nose at the slightly stale musty smell that remained. Bill entered with Caro and Harry waited patiently while others walked in; he was in no rush. Eventually Hermione nudged him gently and he cleared his throat.

"You ready, Ginny?"

She nodded, her face wet with tears.

Her mother had walked up to stand beside them and she took Ginny's other hand. "Come on, dear."

Harry was glad of Sirius's warm presence behind him; his hand on Harry's shoulder.

They cleared the doors and shuffled around the frozen group of adults gazing at the remains of the snake. It came into view slowly; a large green creature with torn sightless yellow eyes that had dimmed with decay. Its mouth was open and filled with sharp fangs that sent another shiver through Harry.

"Bloody hell!" Ron muttered under his breath and nobody remonstrated with him about his language.

Ginny raised her head from its hiding place in Harry's shoulder, took one look at the huge corpse of the basilisk and fainted. Molly and Sirius reacted quicker than Harry as Hermione had tightened her hold on his other hand. They both caught Ginny before she hit the floor.

"I thought this would happen." Molly muttered. "I knew she wasn't ready for this! But she was so determined and wouldn't listen to me! Her own mother!"

Bill hurried over to his sister's side. "How is she?"

Remus checked Ginny's pulse. "It's just a faint but I think it's best we get her up to the infirmary. I'll carry her for you, Molly."

"Thank you, Remus." Molly said. "Come on, Ron."

"But Mum…" Ron complained.

"You've seen the basilisk and the Chamber." Molly said briskly. "In fact there's no need for any of you children to be down here anymore."

"Mum, Harry needs to stay in case a parselmouth is needed and I'm sure he'd appreciate Ron and Hermione's support." Bill said, before anyone could argue.

Molly looked for a moment as though she wanted to protest but in the end gave a nod. She turned to Sirius. "Thank you for catching Ginny."

"Not a problem." Sirius said.

Harry frowned at the strain in Sirius's voice but waited until the others had left before he said anything. "You OK, Padfoot?"

Sirius nodded and clasped the back of Harry's neck. "Just…I know I've seen your memory of what happened but seeing that beast for real and knowing how close you came…" he stopped abruptly.

Harry sent Hermione a look and she let go of him so he could hug Sirius. He mouthed a thank you at her and she sent him an understanding smile back.

Sirius held onto him for a long time – long enough for the others to collect themselves and begin organising.

Brimbold had his team start on breaking down the basilisk with Snape hovering in wondrous appreciation for the potions ingredients. Bill and Caro moved ahead to examine the walls of the Chamber and the Professors followed after them, talking in reverential tones. A few of them, Hagrid and Moody in particular, looked sympathetically towards Sirius and Harry, and Minerva wandered over to engage Ron and Hermione in a discussion. Sirius stayed wrapped around Harry and for once Harry didn't protest the hug going on too long or in front of someone, knowing that it was Sirius who needed the comfort not him.

Eventually, Sirius took a deep breath and loosened the tight hold he'd had on Harry. "OK."

"Yeah?" asked Harry softly.

"Yeah." Sirius said quietly. "Just promise me no more basilisks."

"I promise that I will not fight any more basilisks if I can help it." Harry said.

"That's good enough." Sirius patted his back and eased away, still keeping a hand on Harry's shoulder though to ground himself.

Moody wandered over and Harry smiled at the old Auror who gave him a nod of acknowledgement. "I'm looking forward to having you in my Defence class, Potter. You did a good job with this bloody basilisk."

"I was lucky." Harry replied. "Fawkes helped me out a lot."

Moody nodded. "Luck's half the battle, lad." His magical eye swivelled and fixed on Sirius. "Black, you're as pale as a ghost. Here." He thrust his flask at him. "Take a sip and don't argue with me."

Sirius took a swig of what Harry assumed was whiskey or some other alcoholic beverage, and handed the flask back. "Thank you, sir."

"None of that 'sir' business. Haven't had the chance to say anything to you since you got cleared but I cocked it up with your arrest. Should have checked on you after Crouch hauled you off and made sure there was an interview." Moody said grimly.

"I don't blame you, Alastor." Sirius said. "I remember what the office was like back then. You were lucky if you got a minute to do the paperwork before there was another raid to go on."

"Still, it's no excuse." Moody said crisply. His magical eye suddenly swivelled towards Harry. "Where's your wand?"

Harry grinned and showed him his wrist holster.

"Good lad." Moody nodded at him. "Always remember…"

"Constant vigilance!" Sirius and Harry chorused together.

A chuckle behind them had them turning to find Remus smirking at the two of them. He ruffled Harry's hair. "I had a moment of déjà vu there. You know after every training session with Professor Moody here Sirius and James would turn up and yell 'constant vigilance' at me?"

Moody looked over at Sirius who had a hint of colour in his cheeks.

"We might have maybe sometimes done that…" Sirius allowed. "Anyway, enough about me…"

Harry exchanged an amused look with Remus at Sirius's discomfort.

"…how's Ginny?" Sirius asked as Ron and Hermione gathered back around them.

Harry sobered and awaited Remus's reply eagerly.

"With Madame Pomfrey." Remus said. "I sent a patronus message to her so she was waiting in the bathroom. She's taken Ginny to the infirmary; she thinks it was just too much for her."

"Mum and Dad tried to convince her not to come but she wouldn't hear it!" Ron confirmed, but there was relief written across his face with the news that Ginny was fine.

"It was brave of the lass to make an attempt." Moody said.

Snape gave a large snort in the background.

Remus put a hand on Sirius's arm so he wouldn't retort. "How are things going down here?" He said lowering his voice.

"Well, so far I've freaked out, Harry gave me a hug and Moody gave me some Firewhiskey." Sirius answered.

"I don't do hugs." Moody deadpanned.

They all burst out laughing at that.

"Some of us are trying to work." Snape snapped.

Sirius was prevented from retorting again by Remus who suddenly pointed at the statue of Slytherin. "Didn't the basilisk originate from the mouth of the Slytherin statue?" He began walking towards it and Sirius settled for glaring at Snape before nodding at Harry in agreement that they should follow Remus.

The others saw their direction and Bill walked over to join them. "We haven't found anything here in the outer chamber." He admitted. "Bertie, Caro and Professor Dumbledore are going over it a second time but I don't think anything's here."

"But the basilisk came out of the statue so perhaps there's something beyond it?" Remus mused out loud. He started waving his wand in a scanning spell that Harry recognised from the ring search.

Bill joined him, repeating the movements. He inhaled sharply. "There's a parseltongue ward."

"Didn't the…the diary version of Riddle say something when he called forth the basilisk?" Sirius prompted.

Harry nodded. "Should I…?"

"Just wait a moment until we've updated everyone." Bill said, walking back towards Caro.

It seemed to Harry to take forever before everyone bar the Creature Specialist team were back in front of the statue – or rather to the side in case any additional mythical beasts came out – and waiting for Harry to say the password.

"*Speak to me, Slytherin! Greatest of the Hogwarts four!*" Harry stated loudly. The rumbling sound of the mouth opening had Harry instinctively ducking his head, the memory of the basilisk emerging uppermost in his thoughts.

Sirius and Remus immediately moved closer to him. Hermione sneaked her hand back into his and smiled at him reassuringly as Ron hovered closer.

It took a long moment but he realised there were no sounds of slithering – nothing was coming out of the mouth.

"Right." Caro said briskly. "I'll go up and take a quick look." She transformed into a tiny sparrow and took flight.

Harry watched her wide-eyed. He'd been thinking about his animagus form ever since Minerva had agreed to allow him the same deal as his father since Sirius would actually be teaching him. He really didn't want to be a stag. He loved that his patronus was a symbol of his father but he wanted to be something different. He got 'you're so like your father' enough without adding his animagus form to it. He had toyed with the hope of canine forms – a wolf or a dog; he wouldn't mind either as both would represent his respect and affection for Sirius and Remus. He wasn't sure about cats; he didn't mind them but he remembered his days of hell with Mrs Figg too much to want to be one. He definitely didn't want to be a snake. He didn't mind snakes, basilisks aside, but he didn't like the idea of transforming into one. A bird though…to be that free…

Caro transformed back into her human form and shouted down that there was a room…and suddenly there was a shriek…

A tiny sparrow zoomed out of the mouth followed by a large black cloud…

Harry was pushed behind Sirius and Remus with Hermione and Ron; the two men took up a defensive position – wands out as the sparrow fled the black mist…

Harry could see that the others were scattering, hiding behind pillars and raising their wands…

Bill yelled something at Bertie that Harry couldn't hear over an ominous rumble coming from the statue…but the two of them raised their wands and began casting something white in the direction of the black cloud…

The cloud took shape into a snake and abandoned its chase of the sparrow; it dived for the two wizard threatening it…

Harry's heart pounded fast in chest.

Dumbledore moved, his wand weaving sharply in the air as he cast the same spell to the rear of the cloud…

But it wasn't going to be enough…

"*Stop!*" Harry's voice hissed out.

And the black cloudy snake disappeared just before it hit Bill and Bertie, leaving an eerie silence in its wake.

Harry could hear Hermione's ragged breathing and he took her hand as he turned to check she was alright. She nodded at his questioning look and they both turned to Ron who gave a shaky nod and clapped Harry's shoulder.

"Well done, mate!" Ron said. "What was that thing?"

"A guardian spirit." Remus explained. "Obviously deactivated by parseltongue."

"Yes, obviously." Sirius said, rolling his eyes, but he grinned at Harry. "Good thinking, Harry."

Harry decided he wasn't going to tell anyone that it had been pure instinct.

"Yes, well done, my boy!" Dumbledore beamed at him. "I haven't had this much fun in years!"

Minerva shot him a 'I can't believe you said that' look.

Caro transformed back. She barely looked out of breath or startled. "I triggered the spirit when I couldn't respond to a snake ornament up there but I think that was the only thing there." She looked at Bertie. "Try again?"

Bertie nodded.

Everyone moved back to their defensive positions as Caro flew back up in her sparrow form once more. There was a brief silence and then she called out it was all clear. Harry watched as ladders were pulled out of Bill's satchel and ropes to tie them securely in place. They were floated up to Caro to anchor and Bill headed up first, followed immediately by Bertie and Dumbledore.

"Are we…are we going up?" Hermione stared at the ladders with foreboding.

Harry remembered that she hated heights and squeezed her hand gently. "I don't think so. I don't think we're needed anymore."

"What about if they need you for another one of those spirit things?" Ron asked bluntly.

Harry shook his head. "I think that was it."

Sirius cleared his throat. "I think Harry's right. We should head upstairs. If they need you for parseltongue again we can come back."

Minerva nodded sharply. "I'll send a patronus if we need you." She smiled warmly at Harry. "You did very well, Harry."

"Thanks." Harry was relieved as they set back off, leaving the basilisk and the Chamber behind. Sirius sent a ball of light through the tunnel to lead the way and Hermione chattered on about the spell that he had used; Ron rolled his eyes at her in exasperated fondness.

The climb back up was arduous and they were all breathing heavily by the time they got to the bathroom.

"You're back!" Myrtle warbled in greeting.

Harry didn't immediately have the breath to reply; he waved at her.

"The redheaded girl was carried out this time." Myrtle informed him. "Her mother was not pleased! My mother wouldn't have been pleased either."

"We'd best go see Ginny." Harry said to Ron and Hermione.

"You're leaving me already?!" Myrtle complained.

"We'll come back and see you when school starts," Harry said, "I promise."

"Me too, Myrtle." Hermione said.

Myrtle gave a huff and jumped in a toilet, water splashing on the floor.

Sirius laughed. "Somehow I think she wanted Harry to herself, Hermione."

Harry shot him a look as Ron and Hermione joined Sirius in chuckling.

Remus steered them towards the door. "Let's get to the infirmary."

They trooped through the school with Remus and Sirius telling stories of events in various corridors. Harry and Ron listened eagerly, sniggering as Hermione's expression morphed from one of interest to horror at the rule-breaking.

"You can't encourage Harry and Ron to do that!" She exclaimed as another tale ended (with a boy called Mulciber dressed in a fetching purple thong dancing down the corridor they were walking through). "Do you know how many school rules you broke?"

"Five, six if you consider Mulciber was out of school uniform and it was essentially our fault." Remus answered absently.

Sirius stared at his friend for a moment and burst out laughing. "Only you, Moony."

"And we can't really say anything, Hermione," Harry pointed out, amusement colouring his tone, "how many rules did we break rescuing Buckbeak and Sirius?"

"Or saving Ginny in the Chamber?" Ron agreed.

"That was different!" Hermione protested. Her chin went up and her lips took on a stubborn set that Harry knew all too well. "Besides, when we saved Sirius we had the Headmaster's permission so technically we didn't break any rules, and you did have Lockhart with you when you went after Ginny so…"

Sirius and Remus broke out laughing again. Hermione looked at them askance and Harry just shook his head at her when she turned to him for support.

They all sobered up though as the doors of the infirmary came into sight. Harry felt his gut twist. He seemed to spend an inordinate amount of time in the infirmary and he had never liked the place. He followed Remus inside and immediately spotted Molly sat by a bed in the corner; Ginny was tucked up and looked fast asleep.

Molly waved them over. "She was hysterical when she came to – she wanted to go back. Poppy gave her a sleeping potion. Poppy said she was suffering from shock. I've left a message with Arthur's secretary. Hopefully, he'll be able to get here once his meeting is finished." She stroked Ginny's cheek gently. "She was so determined to come. We thought we were doing the right thing."

"You couldn't have known how she would react for certain, Molly." Remus said soothingly. "Nobody really does know how they'll face the site of a traumatic event until they're there."

"I freaked out too." Harry confessed, hoping to make Molly feel a bit better about allowing Ginny to go along.

"Me too." Ron admitted, shifting closer to his Mum.

"And me three." Sirius said gently. "And I only saw Harry's memory of what happened."

"If she had been able to handle it, it would have been a positive experience for her to face her fears." Remus added.

"Which was why I endorsed the effort." Madame Pomfrey bustled into the room and glared at the crowd of people surrounding the bed. "You may have to return her to her mind healer, Molly. She's clearly still dealing with the after effects of her experience."

Molly went bright red. "She…we…" she stuttered before getting hold of herself, "Ginny hasn't seen a mind healer. She seemed back to normal and the Headmaster said she was OK so…"

Madame Pomfrey's eyes widened dramatically, her face turning as red as Molly's. "And when did the Headmaster receive his healing qualifications?" She all but shouted.

Harry felt supremely awkward standing in between the two women.

"I told you at the time that your daughter would need…"

Sirius cleared his throat. The mediwitch shot the assembled crowd a look and took a calming breath evidently reigning in whatever she'd been about to yell given the presence of other people.

"I highly recommend that you engage a mind healer *now*." She said briskly. "If you'll excuse me…" She swept away before anyone could say anything.

Molly's colour hadn't abated at all and she wouldn't look at any of them. "I thought she was fine. She's had a few nightmares over the last year or so but nothing that would indicate a real problem."

Harry had no idea what to say and he had a feeling Ginny would be mortified to hear her mother discussing her problems with so many people.

"Kids are remarkably resilient," Remus assured her gently, "but with her reaction to the Chamber, she obviously hasn't come to terms with her experience. I'm sure a mind healer would be able to help her."

"I can recommend a good one." Sirius added, a little hesitantly.

Ron stirred restlessly. "We can use the money from the basilisk, Mum." He bit his lip, before he continued on anyway. "You can have my share if Ginny's won't cover it."

"That's kind of you, Ronald," Molly patted his hand and smiled at her son, "and you're a good brother for offering but that money's a nest egg for you."

"I'm sure Ginny's share will more than cover it." Remus said. "Basilisk products sell well."

Molly nodded and met Sirius's eyes with a determined expression. "A recommendation for a mind healer would be appreciated."

Sirius smiled. "I'll owl you his details when I get home."

A Hogwarts elf popped into the infirmary and bowed to Sirius. "Professor Babbling is ready to meet with you and your Heir, the Lord Harry Potter, at your convenience, Lord Black."

"Thank you." Sirius said formally.

The elf popped away again.

It was his test results. Harry was assaulted by a rush of nerves; twisting, torturing nerves that writhed in his belly and made him want to throw up. What if he hadn't passed? What if he'd failed? Sirius would be so disappointed in him…

His mouth went dry.

"Come on." Sirius nudged his elbow. "We shouldn't keep Professor Babbling waiting."

Molly managed to dredge up a smile for Harry. "Good luck, Harry."

"Yeah," Ron said, punching Harry's upper arm lightly, "good luck, mate."

"You'll be fine, Harry. You can't have discussed Runes as much as you did at lunch without knowing enough to have passed the requirements for fourth year." Hermione informed him as they wandered out of the infirmary with final farewells to the Weasleys all consisting mainly of hopes that Ginny would feel better shortly.

When they reached the main staircase, Remus paused and nodded at Harry. "Hermione and I will meet you at the entrance. Good luck."

Sirius's firm hand on Harry's shoulder guided him back through Hogwarts' maze of corridors to Professor Babbling's office.

She greeted them warmly and within moments Harry found himself sitting rather uncomfortably on a wooden chair in front of her desk, Sirius beside him.

Professor Babbling smiled a tad nervously. "Well, firstly, I have to admit to making a mistake."

"Oh?" Sirius asked immediately protective.

"I accidentally gave Harry part of the fourth year final exam along with the third year." Professor Babbling confessed ruefully.

So that was why there had been so many questions! But that meant he hadn't had the full time for his third year questions and…Harry bit his lip, nerves rushing him again.

"Now, it has led to some surprising results." Professor Babbling continued. "On the third year material, taking into account your reduced time for the essay question and so removing it from consideration, you scored an Outstanding."

Outstanding!

He'd gotten an Outstanding! He almost drowned in the relief and turned to Sirius with a happy grin.

"I'm so proud of you, Harry." Sirius said, reaching over and gripping his shoulder. "That's excellent work!"

"Yes," Professor Babbling smiled widely at him, "you did very well. Only your friend Hermione and Anthony Goldstein did better on those portions of the exam and I'm sure if you had been given the full time you may have equalled or surpassed them."

Harry flushed warm with the praise and the almost definable paternal pride he could see oozing from Sirius as the Professor continued talking.

"But the really interesting thing for me," Professor Babbling said, "is that you scored an Acceptable on the fourth year material you answered, and really once again, if you'd had the proper time you may well have scored an Exceeds Expectation. Certainly your analyses of the Runic combinations were very well done."

"That's brilliant!" Sirius declared when Harry remained speechless. "So I assume there is no issue with him taking the fourth year class?"

"Well, that's what I wanted to discuss with you." Professor Babbling leaned back and fixed Harry with an intent stare. "If you continued tutoring for the rest of the Summer, I believe you'd pass the fourth year final exam, and would therefore be able to sit with the fifth year class in September."

Harry looked at her astounded. "You mean…I'd…" he gestured jumping weakly with his fingers.

"Skip a year, yes." Professor Babbling said with a smile. "There are advantages; firstly, it would keep you challenged. I think a fourth year placement would bore you. Secondly, you could take the OWL at the end of the year and this would mean one less OWL for you to take next year which given the fifth year syllabi for the core subjects is recommended. Thirdly, on the assumption you would take your NEWT in your sixth year, I would not be adverse to signing you up to complete the initial Mastery year in your seventh. Whether you continue or not, the training would be useful in several professions."

Harry swallowed hard and darted a look at Sirius. He was really pleased to be considered but he wasn't sure if he wanted to jump a year but there were no hints at Sirius's thoughts as his father was intently listening to Babbling.

"There are disadvantages, of course," the Runes Professor said with a wave of her hand, "you'll be taking classes with the year above you and outside of your peer group which may lead to some resentment and suggestion of preferential treatment. Additionally, you would be sitting an OWL a year early and that would make fourth year exams slightly more stressful for you. But I think the advantages far outweigh the disadvantages in your case, Mister Potter. What do you think?"

What did he think? He glanced again at Sirius who looked back at him with calm thoughtful grey eyes and he knew Sirius was waiting for him to make his own decision.

He *really* didn't want to skip a year. People would think it was favouritism and special treatment. He would stand out; be different; not normal *again*. His entire being wanted to blurt out that fourth year class was fine with him.

But.

Hadn't he promised Sirius to always do his best? If he didn't skip a year, wasn't that holding himself back? Just as he had with all of his schooling before Sirius? Wasn't his aversion to his classmates resenting him just a reverse kind of peer pressure to conform?

"Mister Potter?" prompted Professor Babbling gently.

Harry bit his lip and sighed. "I'd like to try for the fifth year class if I can continue being tutored?" He looked over at Sirius who nodded.

"I can continue tutoring you, Harry; that's not an issue." Sirius assured him.

"I am worried though," Harry murmured, getting a sudden spurt of inspiration, "about people thinking that it's favouritism? I mean, I've only gotten the chance to move into fifth year Runes because of switching subjects and an accident with the exam so…" he sighed heavily, "is there any way we can offer the same deal to anyone else who might have gotten an Outstanding on the third year exam?" Like Hermione, who would probably jump at the chance to sit the fourth year exam with him and hopefully enter fifth year Runes alongside him.

"Oh, what an interesting question." Professor Babbling said, slumping back in her seat as she considered it.

Sirius winked at Harry seemingly understanding his ploy. "I think it's an excellent suggestion." He smiled at the Professor. "I'm thrilled Harry's done so well and has the opportunity to enter fifth year but I'm also concerned about his alienation from his peer group. He has enough obstacles in that regard with the Boy Who Lived nonsense. I think offering the other students who gained an Outstanding the opportunity to sit the fourth year exam at the beginning of September and the chance to move up would alleviate the majority of any resentment."

"I will need to run it by Professor McGonagall but I don't see any reason why we can't owl the Outstanding students by tomorrow and make the offer, explaining the circumstances." Professor Babbling confirmed.

Sirius smiled at her again. "Excellent."

The Professor rose to her feet and Harry leapt to his, grateful it was all over until he returned to school officially. He barely managed the goodbyes as Sirius hurried them out.

As soon as they were in the corridor, Sirius pulled him into a quick hug.

"I am so proud of you." Sirius said again. "You aced the test and you were brilliant about the whole moving up a year thing."

Harry returned the hug, feeling giddy with delight at Sirius's visible happiness in Harry's achievement. "I couldn't have done it without your help." He pointed out as they made their way back to Hermione and Remus.

"You're an excellent student, Harry." Sirius countered. "And, yes; I am an excellent tutor!" He winked at him and Harry chuckled.

They spied Remus and Hermione waiting by the massive front doors. Hermione was almost bouncing by the time they reached them.

"Well?" She demanded. "Did you pass? Did it go OK? It's OK if it didn't go OK but I'm sure you did fine and…"

Remus put a hand on her shoulder. "Take a breath and let him answer, Hermione." He looked hopefully at both Sirius and Harry. "Well?"

Harry smiled happily. "I passed."

"He got an Outstanding!" crowed Sirius.

Hermione squealed and launched herself at Harry.

Harry gave an omphf as he caught her, his arms automatically wrapping around her and noting that she was a girl in the way her body pressed against his in interesting places. He looked startled over her bushy hair for advice from Sirius who simply smirked back at him. Hermione untangled herself from Harry with a sheepish expression but she surprised him when she held onto him, one of her arms wrapped around one of his.

"Well done, Harry!" Remus congratulated him. "I think this calls for cake and ice-cream."

"Oh, there's more." Sirius said and motioned for Harry to speak.

Harry explained the accident with the fourth year exam papers and the opportunity to test into fifth for all of the Outstanding students.

Hermione squealed again but he was ready for her hug and grinned at her beaming face. "Oh, Harry! This is fantastic! Just think! We could sit our OWL a year early and that's one less for our fifth year and – oh, but there's only a month and I've only just started reading for Runes! And then there's…"

"You're more than welcome to join Harry's tutoring lessons, Hermione." Sirius said quickly.

"And if I can get into fifth year Runes, you definitely can." Harry assured her. "You did better than me on the third year stuff."

Hermione smiled up at him and nodded briskly. "Anthony Goldstein and Daphne Greengrass probably got Outstandings as well. Maybe Sue Li? I wonder if they'll want to take the test. Probably Anthony will. He told me before the exam that he was already half a term into the fourth year material."

The sound of someone approaching had them turning around rapidly to see Bill running up to them.

Sirius sent Remus a questioning look and Remus nodded.

"I sent a patronus asking if we were needed to remain here and for an update. I didn't expect a personal reply."

Bill waved at them as he joined them before bending double and catching his breath. "Merlin, that's some climb!"

"I preferred Fawkes helping me out." Harry admitted.

"So, what was in the secret room?" asked Sirius. "Do you need Harry?"

Bill shook his head. "There's nothing in the room."

"Nothing?" questioned Remus sharply, his eyes narrowing before he sighed deeply. "Of course, anything of value, Voldemort would have taken when he discovered the Chamber as a teenager, as Tom Riddle."

"That's our theory." Bill confirmed. "There's evidence that there were books, potions and there are some old cauldrons that were left lying on the floor but…" he shook his head, began to speak and stopped again at the sight of Hermione before he opened his mouth again, "definitely nothing of value."

Harry knew that meant the object they were looking for must be hidden elsewhere in Hogwarts. They'd have to regroup.

Sirius sighed. "I guess it was unlikely he would have gone back there if he'd taken everything of value with him."

"Bertie and the Headmaster are doing another check to see if there are any other nooks and crannies down there where stuff might have been hidden away but…" Bill shrugged.

Hermione was looking from Sirius to Bill to Remus with a calculating look that Harry knew all too well.

He hurriedly cleared his throat. "We should get going."

"Me too," Bill said, "I volunteered to come up so I could check on Ginny."

"Poppy gave her a sleeping potion." Remus informed him. "But I'm sure your Mum would appreciate the support. She's had a bit of a shock."

Bill nodded. "See you guys."

Sirius nodded. "Tell Bertie I'll owl." He ushered Hermione and Harry out of the door. "Come on. The sooner we get clear of the wards, the sooner we celebrate with cake and ice-cream!"

Harry smiled at Sirius's antics but his eyes caught Hermione's contemplative expression again and his heart sank. He didn't want to keep secrets from his friends but Sirius and Remus had discussed the necessity of it with him many times and he knew it was for their protection as much as it was for his. They didn't *need* to know about the treasure hunt or about the prophecy (and there were times as he had confided in Healer Allen that he wished he hadn't been so insistent on learning about it himself) and knowing about either would only put them in danger.

Hermione suddenly slipped her hand into his again. "It's OK, Harry." She whispered as they fell behind the two men striding away down the path out of the castle. "I know you can't tell me and I know it's probably something to do with the death threat and with *him*, but if you need me…"

He tightened his grip on her hand so relieved at her unequivocal support that he couldn't speak for a long moment. "Thanks." He managed eventually.

She smiled at him and started talking about fourth year Runes and how he wasn't to tell her what was on the exam but she had started reading about the recombinations of Runes in protection in her fourth year text book and what were Harry's thoughts?

They discussed Runes all the way to the Hogwarts gates and caught up with Remus and Sirius waiting for them on the path. Harry and Hermione came to a halt in front of the two men and Harry waited impatiently; weren't they supposed to be doing something like apparating them?

"Harry," Sirius said dryly, "I'm afraid you're going to need to let go of Hermione so Remus can apparate with her to Black Manor."

Harry looked at him confused for a long moment before he realised he was still holding onto Hermione's hand. He blushed furiously as they untangled their fingers and Hermione, her own cheeks a rosy red, stepped away towards a visibly smirking Remus.

Sirius winked at Harry and placed an arm around Harry's shoulders as Remus disappeared out of sight. "Hold tight."

They reappeared in the reception room and Hermione smiled at him shyly.

Harry blushed again but smiled back to reassure her there was no harm done, and wondered again at the flip-flopping sensation in his belly. Cake, he decided as he followed Sirius out of the room; he just wanted cake; it had nothing to do with Hermione.
