Harry's heart thundered in his chest and his breath rasped sharply in his throat as he tried to make himself smaller behind the boulder he'd managed to find for cover.

He peeked out.

The Horntail was stomping further into the arena. She was furious, her viciously spiked tail lashing out.

Harry's eyes widened in alarm.

The eggs!

He threw his arm out, wand in his hand, and cast a shield hurriedly over them just as the tail came down with a crash.

Harry breathed out in relief as the tail lifted to reveal the intact eggs. His shield had worked.

On the other side of the arena, the Fireball roared, recognising the new threat to her eggs. She caught the Horntail's attention. Another fierce cry rang out, this time directed at the Fireball as the Horntail challenged her. The Fireball answered it furiously, getting to her feet and shaking off the remnants of ice clinging to her scales. The Horntail lowered her head and attacked.

Harry looked around anxiously, assessing the situation breathlessly. He was stuck. There was open ground between him, the dragons and his path out of the arena. They might be distracted while they were fighting but he wasn't certain he wanted to take the risk of them both spotting him and deciding to gang up on him instead of battling each other. But there was the problem of what was going to happen once the battle was over.

There was better cover behind the flag where the flat of the rock sheared away providing a roof of sorts to a dip below. If he could get there…

He checked on the dragons.

The Fireball was at a disadvantage, chained and befuddled from the cold spell Harry had used, but she was lithe and using her greater manoeuvrability to avoid the worst of the Horntail's swipes and hits. She was also using the former nest as cover occasionally, picking up shards and loose rock to throw at the Horntail in between sending jets of fierce fire towards the other dragon. The Horntail lashed out with one wing and the Fireball in avoiding it ran straight into the Horntail's tail. She flew backwards, her chain breaking with a snap as she landed on her side with a massive smack on the nest.

She didn't get up.

The Horntail roared her victory.

Harry's eyes fell on his robe lying on the ground. He wet his lips, a plan forming in his head. He mouthed the spell quietly; the robe rose from the ground as though pulled by invisible ropes to spin in mid-air. Another spell had it growing rapidly spreading out to provide a wide curtain between him and the Horntail.

He ran.

He was almost at the eggs when the sound of ripping fabric had him glancing behind to see the Horntail rending the robe to pieces with its claws. She tossed the remains to the side as she stormed forward and Harry knew he didn't have time to get under cover.

He threw up a shield as the Horntail slapped a massive foreleg down on him. He blinked as the foot stopped bare inches from his body. He rolled out as the dragon lifted her leg again and hurriedly threw up another shield as the leg came down again; the tail landing close enough to the side of him that the rock beneath shook. He absently noticed the Fireball regaining her feet on the other side of the arena.

He was reminded how the Fireball had used the rocks around to pound on the Horntail and he pointed his wand at the wall of rock behind and with a rushed spell lobbed a chunk of rock at the Horntail.

The jagged boulder of black granite hit the Horntail in the face, whipping her head back painfully, and she yowled in pain.

Harry scrabbled backwards, careful of the eggs close behind him. He flicked his wand and sent another barrage of rocks and debris at the Horntail.

The Horntail batted them away though. She snarled through the green blood dripping down her face where Harry had wounded her and lashed out with her right wing, Harry could see the tail already in motion to hit him if he darted out of the way of the wing. And if he moved, the eggs were going to be smashed. He hastily threw up another shield, barely aware that it shimmered with gold and silver.

The wing descended…

The Horntail's mouth opened to deliver a devastating blast…

"Arrestus!" Harry pointed his wand and pushed the rest of his power into the spell.

The Horntail froze.

And a rock smashed down on the Horntail's head; once, twice, three times.

The Horntail crumpled into a bloody heap, its head caved in.

The Fireball stood behind it, the large rock clutched in one claw. She dropped it and the broken chain around its leg scraped along the ground.

For a terrifying second, the Fireball bristled, the golden spikes around its head erect. Harry kept still, his heart stampeding in his heart; he couldn't breathe, didn't dare.

And their eyes met.

There was pain in the Fireball's gaze and something else; an intelligence that seemed to judge Harry in every way.

Harry swallowed hard, desperately trying to think of anything that would work. The image of Merlin talking to the dragons in the play he had seen over the Summer flashed through his head and Harry latched onto it. "*Please…*" he whispered, unaware the word had hissed out in Parseltongue.

The dragon cocked her head.

"*Please.*" Harry whispered again. "*Let me go. Your eggs are safe. I protected them and I would never hurt them, I promise.*"

Her green-slitted eyes shifted to the intact eggs. She sniffed at her young. Slowly, the Fireball's ruff sank back to lie flat. She gave a snort and sank back on her haunches.

Harry moved slowly, not entirely sure she wouldn't attack him still despite apparently doing what he had asked. He carefully got to his feet and sidled away. The Fireball didn't look at him; she crept into the space Harry had vacated and curled protectively around her eggs. Harry stumbled around the massive body of the Horntail, hurrying as fast as he could to the path. He fell a couple of times, his legs shaky and weak, but he scrambled back up each time.

At the gate, he wasn't surprised to see Sirius on the other side waiting for him, Remus not far behind. Sirius opened the small wooden door and Harry all but fell against him.

Sirius clutched Harry tightly to him. Harry tucked his head against Sirius and breathed.

He was safe.

Bagman was announcing something.

Harry didn't care. He tightened his grip on Sirius, his scratched-up hands fisting in the material of Sirius's robes. He felt Sirius rub his back, small circles of warmth as Harry shook. There was another hand on his shoulder providing a comforting grounding anchor; Remus.

"Come on, Pronglet." Sirius said quietly. "Let's get you to the infirmary tent."

He didn't release his hold on Harry though, and Harry figured Padfoot was waiting on him to move. He slowly convinced his fingers to let go, one at a time. He pushed weakly on Sirius's chest and Sirius helped steady him as he got upright.

Sirius slid an arm around his waist. "Do you think you can walk?"

Harry nodded quickly but Remus moved to his other side and braced between the two of them he found it wasn't a lie. He could walk although their progress was slow.

Everything hurt.

His arms ached; his hands stung where they were scraped; his legs were sore from the climb and the fall and the stumbles.

Madame Pomfrey met them at the flap of tent. "Goodness, look at you! I'm afraid you're stuck with me; Doctor Jordan is out at the dragon pens healing the injured from that dangerous Horntail." She sniffed. "Dragons! What were they thinking?!"

She chivvied them towards a bed and Harry climbed up and endured the diagnostics with a pained grimace as Sirius hovered beside him; Remus at the end of the bed.

He glanced around. Fleur was curled up in another bed at the far side of the tent; her shoulder was heavily bandaged. An attractive older woman with blonde hair, a distinguished looking man, and a young girl who looked like a miniature Fleur were gathered around her. Her family, Harry guessed.

"What happened to Fleur?" he asked worriedly. She'd faced the Horntail.

"When they were bringing the Horntail into the arena, one of the eggs was dropped and destroyed." Remus explained. "The Horntail was enraged before Miss Delacour even entered the arena." He sighed. "She actually did very well. She hit it with a strong sleep spell, had a similar idea to you with the robe to carry the eggs only…the Horntail woke up before she got more than a few steps away from the original nest. It attacked her and the rest of its eggs were destroyed."

"They had to send half a dozen dragon handlers in to subdue it and get Miss Delacour out." Sirius added. "How the hell did it get free to go on the rampage?"

"A good question." Remus stated dryly.

There was the sound of running feet and Cedric and Viktor both entered. Viktor looked unharmed beyond a strapped-up wrist but Cedric was covered in pink burns paste all over one side of his face.

Pomfrey tutted loudly. "What did I tell you about leaving the tent, Mister Diggory?" She pointed at the bed between Harry and Fleur.

"I snuck out to watch you." Cedric said to Harry as he hurried to sit where she was pointing. "You were just…"

"Incredible." Viktor said gruffly. "Your strategy vas excellent."

Harry shrugged despite the praise making him smile. "How did you both go?"

Viktor frowned heavily. "I used Conjunctivitis Curse but I vas only able to get two eggs as the dragon destroyed the others when she staggered into them."

The curse caused great pain in the eyes and Harry tried not to let his disapproval at deliberately hurting the dragon and causing her to hurt her own eggs show. It could be argued that he had hurt the Fireball just as much, freezing her half to death.

"What about you, Cedric?" Harry asked.

Cedric gave a pained smile. "I summoned my broomstick to fly around it. I managed to get one egg but…it caught me full blast with fire on the second run and that was me out of it." He winced and rubbed the back of his neck. "I'm going to need a new broom too. Mine's ash now."

Harry grimaced. He remembered how he'd felt when the Whomping Willow had battered his first broomstick. It had been a loss. He loved his current broomstick though, mostly because it was his first ever present from Sirius. He was suddenly very glad he had decided not to fly.

"Vou are in lead." Viktor said disgruntled.

"The judges awarded you thirty-five points and you got tens from Bagman and Professor Dumbledore." Cedric expanded. "Madame Maxime gave you a nine and Karkaroff gave you a six."

"Karkaroff is blatantly biased." Remus said with an apologetic look at Viktor. "He gave Cedric three points and Fleur a zero."

Viktor nodded in agreement though. "I did not deserve nine."

"What are your overall scores?" asked Harry as Pomfrey started to wave her wand over his hands, healing up the scratches.

"Fleur has sixteen. Maxime gave her a six, Dumbledore a five and Bagman another five, and you know Karkaroff's score." Cedric recited. "I had all sevens except for Karkaroff so I'm on twenty-four."

"I have thirty-three." Viktor said brusquely.

It was a high score but Harry appreciated that Viktor's competitiveness demanded perfection and he hadn't attained it. Harry squirmed under Pomfrey's fussing over the bruises on his legs.

Remus patted Harry on the shoulder. "I'm going to tell everyone you're fine. I'll see you in your rooms later for the celebration."

Sirius caught hold of Remus before he left. "Find Moody and ask what the hell went down with that Horntail, will you?"

"Definitely." Remus answered.

Harry felt some of the strain ease out of his arms and shoulders as Pomfrey healed them.

"We're done here, Lord Potter. You're free to leave but I highly recommend not using your magic for a day and resting." Pomfrey said. She bustled into the back of the tent which was cordoned off.

Harry slid off the bed and he was pleased that his legs held up better than they had when they'd come out of the arena.

"Ah, there you all are!" Bagman grinned and gave them a brief round of applause that drew disapproving looks from the Delacours. Harry didn't blame them.

"Fantastic performances today, boys!" Bagman said brightly. "Really, really fantastic start to the competition."

Harry, Cedric and Viktor all exchanged a disbelieving look.

"Now, clues for the next task!" Bagman continued chirpily, paying them little attention. He raised a black velvet bag and delved inside. "This one is for you, Cedric. One clue for one egg." He handed Cedric a small golden egg.

It reminded Harry of the small Cadbury Crème eggs that Dudley always scoffed at Easter.

Bagman rooted around the bag again and handed Viktor a larger egg about the size of a normal chocolate Easter egg. Dudley usually had several whereas Harry had never received one from the Dursleys. "Two clues for you, Viktor."

"And for you, Harry," Bagman reached into the bag and improbably brought out a large gold egg, "you get all four clues." He straightened. "Now, you're not allowed to confer or share clues before the next task which will be held on February twenty-fourth!" He gave another smarmy smile and left.

"I should go back to ship." Viktor bowed at Cedric and Harry, departing briskly with no other fanfare.

Cedric sighed and subsided onto the bed. Harry wondered where his parents were; he knew if he was as injured as Cedric Sirius would be hovering…just like he was hovering right at that moment.

"You going to be OK here, Ced?" Harry asked, holding tightly to his egg as Sirius wrapped an arm around him. He wanted to protest but he knew Sirius probably needed the reassurance that Harry was OK.

"Yeah, I only have to stay another hour." Cedric confirmed. "Then I'll be all fixed. No scars which will be good because I think Cho would probably dump me if I had scars, and she definitely wouldn't go to the Yule Ball with me."

Harry froze. "Yule Ball? What Yule Ball?"

o-O-o

"I can't dance!" Harry declared, looking more panicked than he had facing off against a dragon with nothing more than his wand. "I'm terrible! Ask Andy!"

Sirius made a comforting cluck as he directed Harry up a flight of stairs towards the tower. Harry had apparently missed everything Bagman had announced including the news that there was an official tournament ball. He understood some of Harry's consternation; there hadn't been time in Harry's etiquette lessons for polishing Harry's dancing skills that much was true.

"We can teach you enough to get by over the next couple of weeks. It'll be fine." He gave a comforting squeeze since he'd wrapped his arm around his son on leaving the infirmary tent and hadn't let go as they walked back through the school to their quarters. "At least you don't have to worry about who to ask."

"Oh Merln!" Harry clapped one hand to his forehead almost dropping his egg. "I have to ask Hermione!"

"Well, I assume you want to ask her…" Sirius murmured, wondering why Harry was so bothered about it.

"Of course I want to ask her but…" Harry sighed wearily. "We're going on our first date on Saturday and I spent a really, really long time coming up with something special. Now, I have to figure out something for asking her to the ball too! And then there's…"

He went so violently red that Sirius worried it was a reaction to the dragon fight for a moment before Harry mumbled something about kissing. And yeah, Sirius wasn't touching that subject with a ten foot pole unless Harry specifically asked for advice.

"Look," Sirius said firmly, "you've had a busy day," *understatement of the century*, "we have quarters full of your friends waiting to congratulate you for successfully completing the task and, you know, *not dying* with the whole thing with the Horntail so…" he made a vague gesture, "worry about this *tomorrow*."

"Tomorrow." Harry nodded briskly. "Right."

They were almost at the portrait. Sirius gave the password and it swung open, the babble from the waiting group of friends and family. He gave Harry a nudge forward and followed him.

There was an immediate outbreak of applause, whistling and cheering at Harry's entry.

Sirius plucked the egg out of Harry's hands as Hermione rushed over and hugged Harry hard enough that Sirius was pleased that Pomfrey had seen to Harry's bruises before he'd seen her.

"Oh God, Harry, that was the most terrifying thing I've ever seen!" Hermione said, low enough that her voice didn't carry to the rest of the room, but Sirius was close enough to catch it as he safely placed the egg on the table.

Harry patted her back consolingly. "The basilisk was worse."

His matter-of-fact tone brought Hermione back to herself and she moved back to consider him with an arched eyebrow.

"The basilisk bit me," Harry pointed out, "I almost died."

"The Horntail did kind of stomp on you, mate." Ron piped up, moving forward to slap Harry on the shoulder.

"Shield." Harry replied. "I had a shield. I was fine." But there was a flush of red on his neck that gave away his own fear that he might not have survived.

Or maybe Sirius was projecting.

"You were brilliant with the Fireball." Neville beamed at him.

Harry grinned back at him. "How much did you win in Blaise's pool?"

"Lots." Neville said cheerfully.

"Gambling is wrong." Hermione said sternly. "It can lead to all kinds of trouble just look at the twins."

Sirius wondered whether he should investigate as Ron shushed her and darted a quick look around as though to check his mother wasn't present. Sirius cleared his throat and slipped in between the chattering teenagers to gather Harry up.

"Come on." Sirius said cheerfully. "There are others here who want to say hello."

Andromeda approached first as protocol dictated, sweeping Harry out of Sirius's loose hold and into a hug of her own. "You were very smart with the Fireball and frankly I couldn't watch after the Horntail almost roasted you." She leaned back and brushed a hand over the grime on his face. "You need a bath then bed. You're exhausted."

"Madame Pomfrey said no magic for the rest of the day." Harry said.

"And I suggest you don't do anything tomorrow either." Sirius said. "Give your core time to recover." He glanced around. "Where's Ted?"

"There was a report of injured from the Horntail getting loose?" Andromeda said. "He's gone to help."

Sirius surreptitiously inched closer as the Malfoys stood.

Narcissa gave Harry a light hug and kissed his forehead. "You did well, Harry. I was most impressed."

"Your performance was most satisfactory." Lucius didn't try to offer Harry his hand or approach him.

There was a frisson of tension remained between Harry and Lucius. Both appreciated the need to tolerate each other but neither would ever like the other. Sirius wasn't too bothered by that since he didn't think Lucius liked him much and he definitely didn't like Lucius either.

Harry smiled humourlessly back at Lucius. "Perhaps I'm finally living up to my reputation."

Lucius's eyes glittered. "Perhaps." He stroked a hand over the top of his cane. "I expect to have some interesting conversations over the next few days."

Which was good.

If they could convince more of Voldemort's supporters to abandon him because Harry was showing them the power of the opposition, it would be less for them to face in a final showdown.

Harry nodded. "I hope so."

"Oh, I think there'll be a number of interesting conversations with that display of heroics you just performed, Potter." Draco offered his hand to Harry who rolled his eyes and shook it with appropriate seriousness. "Do we know how the Horntail got free to turn up and try to kill you?"

Most of the room looked interested in the answer and Sirius jumped in.

"Remus has gone to investigate." Sirius said.

Narcissa placed a hand on her son's shoulder. "If you'll excuse us; Sirius, Harry. We're going to walk Draco back to Slytherin and take our leave."

Draco pulled a face but nodded. "I should get back and confirm you're still alive."

Sirius's lips twitched as Draco's dry tone. "Your service to the House of Black is appreciated, Draco." He kept his tone light but sincere, and watched as Draco's face lit up with the praise. Apparently it was also enough to warrant an actual real smile from Narcissa. Lucius's suspicious gaze (as though he was wondering about Sirius's motives in praising his son) simply made Sirius's day.

"I should go too." Andromeda said, pulling on her outer robe. "Let Harry get some rest."

Almost immediately Harry's friends surged forward again as Sirius walked the Tonks' and the Malfoys out with a brief confirmation that Friday's family dinner was still on.

By the time he walked back to the main sitting area, the four kids had sprawled into one of the sofas and had started rehashing the entire first task. Dobby was busily providing refreshments.

Sirius snagged a cup of hot chocolate from the elf and took up a watchful pose in front of the fire.

"Krum was brilliant!" Ron enthused.

Hermione shook her head. "He was cruel. The Conjunctivitis Curse is one of the most painful curses!"

"I'm not sure I can throw stones seeing as I froze mine half to death." Harry muttered, wrapping his hands around his mug.

"Poor Fleur!" Hermione said. "She was doing really well too for a while but the sleep spell just wasn't strong enough."

"Cedric did well until the dragon set his broom alight." Neville said diplomatically.

Ron poked Harry. "I thought you were going to summon your broom too, mate?"

"We worked so hard on that plan too." Hermione sighed, folding her arms, obviously waiting for an explanation.

"When they said we had to get the eggs it didn't seem practical." Harry explained. "I fumble the Quaffle enough if I have to carry it in practice and that's with the spell that makes it sticky, I wasn't going to risk eggs."

Hermione sniffed. "Well, you're very lucky magical fire doesn't work the same way as a real fire which uses air as fuel."

"Weird." Ron commented.

"It's also a conjured wind so it doesn't have the same properties." Harry said simply.

Hermione's face brightened. "Where did you learn that spell anyway?"

"Professor Flitwick assigned me an essay on weather charms." Harry began to explain.

Sirius propped an elbow up on the mantelpiece and watched Harry, alive and well if exhausted and dirty, chatter with his friends.

o-O-o

"Stay still!"

The strident tone of the healer had Remus changing directions. He halted his search for Moody and made his way to Doctor Jordan. She and Ted Tonks were surrounded by injured dragon handlers. Most of them looked to have minor injuries, scrapes and burns, but there was a covered body a few feet away by the remains of the gate to the arena. The horror of losing one of their own told on the faces of the waiting men and women.

"Can I help?" Remus asked.

Jordan didn't look up but continued working. "That's OK, Mister Lupin. Healer Tonks and I have it under control."

Ted looked over briefly but only acknowledged Remus with a brief grim nod before turning back to his patient.

Remus decided not to argue. The Healers maybe needed to heal the ones they could after losing a patient. He continued on his way.

He caught sight of the Fireball, drugged and unconscious, being levitated into its pen by a team of dragon handlers. The Weasley hair was like a banner. Remus was pleased to see that Charlie was fine. He was about to move away when Charlie saw him and motioned for him to wait. Remus raised a hand in acknowledgement and folded his arms as he watched them manoeuvring the dragon. He shook his head in renewed amazement that Harry had gone up against it one on one.

It was a few minutes later that Charlie wandered over to him. He looked exhausted.

"Remus," Charlie greeted him with a handshake, "how is Harry?"

"Battered and bruised," Remus said, "but otherwise good." Better off than the dragon handlers Remus had seen waiting for treatment.

Charlie winced as though he'd read Remus's mind anyway. "The Fireball team were impressed with him especially when he protected the eggs."

"I couldn't believe the Fireball just let him go in the end." Remus admitted.

Charlie tilted his to the side, his eyes darting back to the pen. "They're very intelligent creatures despite their reputation of being dumb animals. The Fireball is one of the oldest species. The theory Karl, the team leader, has is that the dragon recognised Harry was protecting the eggs and so wasn't a threat." He gave a small sigh. "Tarkin thought Harry talked her into it since it looked like he said something to her but that's probably wishful thinking. I think all of us dragon handlers wish we could talk to them!"

"The Fireball recognising Harry wasn't a threat seems a reasonable theory to me." Remus said. "I was actually looking for Moody to see if he had found out how the Horntail got loose."

"We'd all like to know." Charlie sighed and shook his head. "It's the craziest thing." He motioned at Remus. "The Horntail team is the most experienced. There is no way they made some kind of mistake."

"Did you know the handler who died?" Remus asked compassionately.

Charlie nodded. "The Reserve is a small place, you know." His face crumpled briefly before he wrestled his grief back. "It's hit us all pretty hard."

Remus made a comforting noise. "I should get on and find Moody."

Charlie pointed to the next pen. "He's in the Horntail's pen with the guys from the Magical Forensic team."

"Thanks."

"No problem," Charlie took a step away, "hey, I was wondering if you can send Mum a patronus, let her know I'm fine?"

Remus could only imagine Molly's reaction if she heard one of the handlers had died and she didn't know Charlie was fine. He cast his patronus and sent it off with Charlie's message.

They headed in different directions and Remus spotted the Horntail's pen immediately. The metal railing and gate were melted in some places, mangled in others. Severus stood by the remains of the entrance and straightened at Remus's approach.

"Lupin." Severus drawled. "This area is off limits."

Before Remus could reply, Moody's gruff voice drifted over the railing. "Let him in Snape."

Severus glowered at Remus but stood aside.

"Thank you, Severus." Remus said politely. He had drawn level with the Potions Professor when Severus cleared his throat.

"I trust Potter is in one piece?" Severus asked casually as though the answer didn't matter to him.

"Poppy healed the bumps and bruises he got." Remus confirmed since he knew Severus was concerned. "He just needs rest."

"He performed adequately." Severus sniffed.

Remus smiled. "High praise from you indeed, Severus." He hesitated a moment. "Any luck with Winky or Summers yet?"

Severus stared down his nose at him. "I believe I will know in three weeks which potion was used. Beyond that…"

"It takes time." Remus nodded. "I'll remind Sirius when he gets too impatient."

"You will be reminding him frequently then," Severus said dryly, "to date, he has contacted me daily for an update."

Remus sighed. Only Sirius… "I'll see what I can do." He promised Severus and finally walked past the railing and into the pen properly.

Moody waved to him from the back of the large pen. Remus spotted Bertie and Caro beside him and a large steel pin that was driven into the ground.

Caro straightened as he approached. "Sirius send you to find out what happened?"

Remus nodded. "Although I am curious to know the answer to that myself." He gestured towards the pin. "What have you found?"

"It's what we haven't found that's the key." Bertie pointed at the empty ground. "No chain."

"There's a faint residue of a banishment charm." Caro chimed in, wiping away the sweat from her brow. "I think it was likely timed to coincide with Harry's attempt at the task."

"The feed was drugged too." Bertie said grimly. "Someone intended for the Horntail to be enraged."

Moody harrumphed. "They couldn't anticipate the eggs getting broken and the Horntail going feral anyway."

"She probably only attacked Miss Delacour in the manner she did because she was under the influence of drugs. It was likely the reason why she didn't stay under the sleep spell either." Bertie sighed. He looked his age for once; tired and weary. "I have to go make a report to Cornelius and Amelia. Whoever did this was responsible for the death of a dragon handler and attempting to kill Harry." He motioned to Caro. "Keep looking for clues. Maybe our culprit dropped something." He sighed. "I'll check in with Bill. He was going to check out the arena."

Caro thinned her lips but applied herself to the task.

Remus grimaced and rubbed his brow. It was no more than they suspected but he wasn't looking forward to breaking the news to Sirius.

"How did they get back here?" Remus asked Moody as they walked back to the mangled gate.

Moody frowned. "Nobody got back here during the last few days. I'd say whoever it was did the damage while the dragons were still being kept in the Forbidden Forest." He huffed impatiently. "The Reserve took responsibility for guard duty then along with a couple of Aurors they accepted for show mostly. I bet Amelia's going to string up her guys' guts for garters."

"It is certain then?" Severus said as they reached him. "It was sabotage."

"Certain as eggs." Moody said with dark humour.

Severus seemed to fall into quiet contemplation as they walked back towards the school, taking it slowly to account for Moody's leg.

"I believe we should consider the possibility that Potter was meant to draw the Horntail in the competition and therefore the preparations were made to make his task a true fight for his life." Severus broke the silence as they approached the tournament tents.

Remus breathed in sharply. "That's not a bad theory. Someone should round up the draw tokens – whatever was used, and examine them."

Moody stopped and pointed at the contestants' tent up ahead of them. "Let's take a gander then, lads."

The tent was empty and devoid of anything but a long table and some flimsy wooden chairs.

Severus sniffed. "There." He pointed at a side table where all four miniature dragons lay still.

Moody huffed and cast a standard detection spell. "Nothing."

"Maybe they couldn't get access to the tokens and that part of the plan failed." Remus suggested. "Otherwise why bother? They couldn't guarantee that the Horntail would enter the arena and kill Harry. It could have just rampaged around the dragon pens."

"Can't argue with that, and either way, I thought Riddle wanted the lad alive at the end of this." Moody said, gathering up the tokens into a bag for evidence anyway.

"He will likely have someone else designated as an alternative for the ritual; one of the other contestants perhaps or the Headmaster or Black." Severus stated matter-of-factly. "But there are two possibilities for him making the task more difficult for Potter: firstly, that he wishes to demonstrate why Potter was able to defeat him as a child in order to underline his anticipated final victory over Potter."

"Strategically that would make sense." Moody agreed grumpily. "It'd scare off any pretenders. Look, see how powerful this lad is, he can defeat dragons but he can't defeat me…so why would anyone else think they can?"

"Well, that's horrifyingly logical." Remus muttered as they left the tent.

"Secondly, this could be a mis-step on the part of Crouch Junior or whichever of his retinue he sent to interfere." Severus said. "Perhaps the order was to make the task more difficult for Potter and the extent was misjudged."

"And that's horrifying in an entirely different way." Remus noted with a sigh. What was worse that Voldemort had set out to make the task truly life-threatening or that his minion had made it so accidentally?

They all paused at the front steps where Hagrid was weeping into a large handkerchief.

"I have to report to Dumbledore." Moody said swiftly and departed much quicker than Remus had considered possible with Moody's bad leg.

"And I should check on the Blood Revelation potion I am brewing." Severus followed after Moody leaving Remus alone with Hagrid.

Cowards, thought Remus with some amusement.

"You alright there, Hagrid?" Remus asked gently, moving to sit beside the half-giant.

Hagrid blew his nose into his handkerchief and shook his head, his bushy beard quivering. "She was a wonderful dragon."

Ah, Hagrid was mourning the loss of the creature. Remus didn't remonstrate him for focusing on the dragon and not the dragon handler who'd lost his life. He knew Hagrid probably mourned both but creatures had been Hagrid's friends and companions long before any wizards were kind to him.

"She was my fav'rite when I went to look in on 'em in the Forest." More tears threatened. "Such beautiful green scales and yellow spikes!"

Remus frowned. "The dragon handlers let you visit?"

"Me an' most of the other professors who knew." Hagrid sniffled.

"Hagrid," Remus asked urgently, "who else visited the dragons that you know about?"

"Well, now," Hagrid frowned in concentration, "there was Olympe, uh, Madame Maxime…" he blushed a violent red, "we might 'ave been walking in the same direction like."

"And?" prompted Remus, deciding to ignore the hint about Hagrid's love life which was more than he had ever wanted to know about Hagrid's love life.

"Um, Pomona and Poppy," Hagrid hummed, "Minnie, Aurora and Septima…oh, and I think I caught sight of a couple of the Durmstrang lads takin' a look. They scarpered pretty quick when they caught sight o' me."

Remus's brow furrowed in thought. It was unlikely that any of the teachers were suspect but a couple of students…no, teenage boys were not capable of such sabotage; banishing with a timing element was advanced magic – and he should know the amount of times the Marauders had tried it on the chairs of various Professors. But if Crouch Junior and Peter or Travers had polyjuiced as a couple of teenage lads and put on Durmstrang uniforms would anyone know they weren't from the school…? That was a possibility.

Hagrid suddenly focused on Remus. "'ow's 'arry?"

"Tired but fine." Remus patted the large man's shoulder. "I should get back to him and Sirius." He headed briskly up the steps and into the castle.

Remus passed by the Fat Lady's portrait and the sounds of a party drifted out. The Gryffindors were clearly celebrating the win. Hopefully Harry was there with them. He bounded into the House of Black's temporary quarters and frowned at the absence of anyone in the main living area before striding across to the study.

Sirius was exactly where Remus expected him to be; sat at his desk. He was also staring at the blank piece of parchment in front of him as though it held the answers to the universe.

"Padfoot?" Remus cleared his throat, knocking loudly on the open door.

Sirius's head jerked up and he waved Remus in.

Remus closed the door behind him. "Harry at the Gryffindor party?"

"Bed." Sirius said. "He started yawning half-way through his cup of chocolate and made the decision himself to go. Hermione, Ron and Neville said they'd represent him at the party." He gesticulated impatiently. "Well?"

Remus slumped into a nearby chair and filled Sirius in on the various evidence and theories.

Sirius collapsed back in his chair and glared at the ceiling once Remus was done. "Never mind Harry, I'm not sure I'm going to survive this tournament, Moony."

There wasn't anything Remus could say to comfort his friend.

"I thought it was bad enough seeing his memories." Sirius continued. "Because seeing them reminded me that because I was stupid and in Azkaban I hadn't been there for him when he was faced with Voldemort again and a bloody basilisk and I had failed Harry and failed James…"

"Padfoot." Remus said softly, his heart tearing because he felt for Sirius but also felt the same guilt only he had no excuse. He should have been at King's Cross waiting for Harry on the first day of his first year…he should have tracked down Harry's primary school and checked on him personally…

"And now," Sirius said as though he hadn't heard Remus, "now I am in his life and how much use was I today? None. I still couldn't bloody help him!" He raised a hand and massaged his brow.

"Sirius," Remus sighed, "you have helped him." He caught Sirius's eye to prevent him replying. "Can you imagine what this tournament would have been like if you hadn't done everything in your power to adopt Harry this Summer? If you'd still been on the run?"

Sirius was quiet.

"He would have had none of the political alliances supporting him; none of the emotional comfort of having you, someone who loves him, present – because while I know you would have done what you could to be close by, you couldn't have been here in the school with him. There wouldn't have been the security around the tournament that there is now and he would have been more at risk." Remus felt his own stomach churn at the image he was drawing. "And Harry himself…his power would have been restricted, he would still be taking a half-hearted approach to studying and he certainly wouldn't have had the spell knowledge he needed to face a dragon."

Sirius lurched out of his chair and paced over to the window at the far side of the room.

"Just because a magical barrier stood between you jumping in front of a dragon for him," Remus said, his throat tight with emotion as he got to his feet and followed after Sirius, "do not ever say you are useless or haven't helped him. Do. Not."

It was enough to break the last of Sirius's defences; his head bowed and his shoulders shook. Remus gathered up his friend and hugged him tightly. Sirius needed the release of tension a good crying jag would give him; he'd almost seen his son trampled to death by a dragon, had watched his son face off against another in a task that had sent one of the Champions out of the arena on a stretcher. It was no wonder Sirius was a mess. Remus was half-tempted to join in; his tears scoured the back of his throat and pushed at the back of his eyes but Sirius needed him to be the strong one.

"Sorry," mumbled Sirius eventually, "I know I shouldn't let it all get to me but…"

"You're allowed to let it get to you occasionally, Padfoot." Remus chided him gently, letting Sirius pull away to blow his nose and mop at his face.

"Just not in public where Crouch Junior will see me though." Sirius grimaced, wafting his handkerchief in the direction of the outside. "Otherwise he'd know his plan to make my life hell was working."

"Focus on the positive, Sirius." Remus advised. "Harry is doing what he set out to do. He completely owned the actual task. He was totally brilliant and he's in the lead. He's on course to win it."

Sirius nodded briskly. "You're right." He took a deep breath and banished the handkerchief. "I think I might turn in early myself."

"Probably a good thing." Remus said mildly.

Sirius gestured back towards the door. "You should go and tell Moody and Albus about the visitors in the Forbidden Forest and the possibility of Crouch and accomplice moonlighting as Durmstrang kids. We should check the map daily; make sure everyone is who they're supposed to be."

Remus nodded. "You'll be alright?"

"I'll be alright." Sirius confirmed. "Thanks, Moony."

"Any time, Padfoot." Remus made for the door and glanced back only to find Sirius in his Grim form huddled up to the window and staring out into the twilight. He hesitated, wondering if he should stay anyway, but in the end the knowledge that he had vital intelligence to impart to others made him leave.

He paused in the living room and Dobby popped immediately.

"Dobby takes care of Harry Potter and Harry Potter's Paddy." Dobby reassured him. "You bes not worrying."

Easier said than done but Remus appreciated the sentiment. He left his loved ones in Dobby's capable hands and went in search of Moody.

*25* *th* *November 1994*

***HARRY POTTER, DRAGON LORD! By Rita Skeeter***

*In a remarkable display of power, Harry Potter, the Boy Who Lived, demonstrated how to tame a dragon. The last Champion to face the first task of the tournament, Harry found himself up against a Chinese Fireball – one of the most dangerous species of dragon, famed for their intelligence and agility. Harry's athleticism saw him climb across the cliffy rocks used in the arena before dropping down behind the Fireball to take it by surprise with a magical ice-cold wind. With the dragon down, Harry was able to carry away the four eggs with aplomb, securing himself first place in the tournament!*

*But that was not the end of Harry's dragon-taming escapade. The Hungarian Horntail which had put paid to French contestant, Fleur Delacour's hopes of completing the task, went feral. Having escaped from its dragon pen, it stampeded into the arena just as Harry was leaving and attacked! In an impressive display Harry teamed up with his former opponent of the Fireball to protect the dragon eggs and overcome the Horntail!*

*It was a riveting and breath-taking to see our young hero fight so heroically!*

*Mister Bagman, the tournament's official Ministry representative, confirmed that investigations by the Department of Mysteries and the DMLE were underway to find out how the Horntail got loose. This lapse in security may be down to the Romanian Reserve dragon team who had responsibility for the upkeep of the dragons during the tournament.*

*Amos Diggory, father of third placed Champion, Cedric Diggory, commented that the tasks and events with the Horntail demonstrated the need for strong magical creature controls and questioned once again the Wizengamot's review of the Magical Creature Laws.*

"Well, well, well," the Dark Lord murmured softly, tapping the newspaper and sending the dragon in the picture on the front page cowering in terror behind the pictorial form of Potter who glared out at the Dark Lord, "it seems Harry avoided your trap, Bartemius." There was a tense note in the Dark Lord's voice that noted his dissatisfaction.

Peter hid his smile as Barty bowed his head in dejected submission and slumped to kneel beside the chair where the infant Dark Lord sat boosted up with a cushion at the dining table.

"I have failed you, Father." Barty said miserably.

Peter tried not to look pleased as he placed the Dark Lord's potion in front of him next to the paper and eased himself down into the seat opposite, his shoulder aching from where Sirius had cut him. The Dark Lord hadn't offered to heal him and Peter had had to make do himself.

"You have done well." The Dark Lord's young hand reached out and stroked Barty's hair. "It was most unfortunate he did not face the Horntail in the task itself but his escape from its rampage has proven he is worthy to be my chosen enemy."

"Why didn't he face the Horntail?" asked Peter carefully. If the Dark Lord was not displeased with Barty then Peter would have to watch his tone.

"According to Karkaroff, Dumbledore created the tokens on the morning of the tournament and kept them with him until he gave them to Bagman for the draw." Barty explained tersely. "There was no opportunity to manipulate them."

"Hmmm," the Dark Lord chuckled, "perhaps the old fool is finally gaining some sense." He turned back to the paper. "And what of your host? Is Igor causing you and Dennis any trouble?"

"He's too scared of you to cause trouble, Father." Barty smirked. "He does our bidding like the snivelling yellow-bellied coward is he."

Peter felt a momentary pang of sympathy for Karkaroff for having to put up with Barty's and Dennis's bullying. Still, he'd never liked the guy and he'd sold out the Dark Lord. Karkaroff had to believe that helping them was his only way of having a chance to live. Of course, what Karkaroff didn't know was that the Dark Lord had already promised Dennis would have the honour of killing Karkaroff after the end of the tournament, when they no longer needed him and the Durmstrang ship to hide within and thus have revenge for Karkaroff sending his father to jail.

He did think it was an ingenious way for the two of them to hide-out at Hogwarts without anyone being any the wiser. The ship was considered Bulgarian territory and none of their enemies could risk going onto the ship without causing a diplomatic incident. Barty had thought of it, of course. It had been relatively easy for the Dark Lord to task a newly freed Dennis Travers with the task of going to Durmstrang in a polyjuiced disguise and threatening Karkaroff into obedience. They had been lucky that the checks for identity were all done within Hogwarts castle and no-one questioned whether there was anybody left on the ship. Dumbledore trusted that his peers had only brought those they had admitted to bringing.

Fool.

It was a small crack in Moody's security net but it was a crack Barty had been quick to take advantage of and take advantage of it they had.

Barty and Dennis had been able to access the dragon pens in relative anonymity pretending to be two of the Durmstrang students. They had successfully sabotaged the feed and the Horntail's chain. It was just the final part for Harry to get the Horntail in the draw that hadn't gone to plan.

Not that the failure seemed to matter to the Dark Lord, Peter thought sourly, careful to keep his eyes lowered to the table so his Master couldn't read his mind.

"Excellent." The Dark Lord drank down his potion. "We have made a successful start to our campaign." He tapped the newspaper again. "But perhaps we shall call this a draw as Potter survived without major injury."

Barty lowered his head again.

"Do not worry, Bartemius." The Dark Lord soothed him like a small child. "Potter will be defeated in good time." He smiled evilly – an incongruous sight on the features of the toddler he inhabited. "And in the meantime we can have some more fun with him. The second task will come soon enough and perhaps…" he gestured at the small sentence announcing a Yule Ball was to be held at Hogwarts as part of the tournament's events. "We should think of something for Yule…a Christmas present."

Barty's face brightened with malevolent glee.

Peter kept his expression as impassive as he could. He was rapidly coming to the conclusion that Barty wasn't altogether sane. But then how could he be, reasoned Peter. Barty had been locked up in a basement by his own father for over ten years. Peter felt his own existence as the family rat of the Weasleys was infinitely preferable in comparison.

"May I…" Barty began eagerly.

"Yes, you may think of something." The Dark Lord acquiesced. "But do not use Fenrir. I have given him another mission."

Barty frowned heavily. "I would have been happy to have assisted you, Father."

"You must always choose the right tool for the right job, Bartemius." The Dark Lord said firmly. "Fenrir is imminently suited for the task of menacing Potter's supporters such as the Weasleys and undermining his political base and agenda, especially as Potter is so focused on being kind to the werewolves. Fenrir is a blunt instrument but he will be effective."

"I understand, Father." Barty said quickly. "And you are right; I will learn to choose the right tool for the right task."

Tools, Peter thought derisively. That was how they were all seen, even Barty himself.

"So, Potter," the Dark Lord murmured down to the picture of Harry, "our war continues and we have won some battles and lost some on either side."

"Father?" Barty asked tentatively.

The Dark Lord's eyes slid to Barty and gazed at him sternly. "Why don't you list our battles so far, Bartemius?"

"The first task was one battle and you declared a draw there." Barty immediately replied, his elegant fingers wriggling in the air. "The second…was getting Harry into the tournament which we won although they tried to claim a victory in defeat."

"Excellent." The Dark Lord said.

Barty regained some confidence with the praise. "We liberated Travers but they foiled our attempt to grab Potter at the World Cup."

"And they have also recently found your elf and the Summers woman." The Dark Lord said quietly.

Barty's face was priceless.

Peter hid his own glee at the shock that radiated through Barty's handsome features. The Dark Lord had been furious when Peter had arrived back from the crypt with the news that he had barely escaped since the location had been found by the Aurors. Peter had kept his head filled with his battle with Sirius and subsequent panicked run from Sirius's Grim form to hide his remarks to his old friend.

He still felt a thrill about what he'd done. He suspected Sirius already knew about the ritual and therefore he didn't believe that he'd betrayed the Dark Lord at all. And he was still committed to being the Dark Lord's servant; believed that in the final showdown the Dark Lord with his years of experience, and guarded against the ancient magic Lily had invoked, would prevail against Harry. But maybe there was the possibility that Harry would pull another rabbit out of his hat and Peter hoped he had done enough to make Sirius hesitate about killing him next time their paths crossed.

"When…" Barty began.

"Last week." The Dark Lord said mildly. "I am surprised that you didn't feel the breach in your blood wards." There was a question in the statement of why Barty hadn't felt it. They'd only been alerted because of the trip alarms that the Dark Lord had insisted be placed around the crypt.

"The spell did call for the blood of a Head of House and as I've had some problems with the inheritance ritual," Barty hurried out as an excuse, "perhaps the wards did not work as they were meant to as I am not the recognised Head of House yet."

"Learn from your mistake, Bartemius." The Dark Lord said. "Your inattentiveness has caused us to lose our spare amniotic fluid for the ritual potion, my willing servant as Peter was almost caught, and our enemy now has your elf in their grasp."

"Winky will not betray me." Barty said firmly. "She loves her bond too much."

"The Blacks were purported to have a spell that would override the ownership of an elf for a short time." The Dark Lord informed him mildly. "I once heard Bella speak of it. I do not doubt the new Lord Black will know of it."

Barty bowed his head again.

"Do not fret, Bartemius." The Dark Lord reached out and stroked Barty's hair. The gesture turned Peter's stomach. "Your Draught of the Sleeping Beauty was perfect and there is no antidote." His young twisted features turned contemplative. "Although Severus might find one at Albus's behest, of course."

That was a possibility. Snape had been a pain back at Hogwarts but he had been a pain with a rare talent. If anyone could find an antidote it was probably Snape, Peter thought with faint alarm.

"Maybe it's time for us to bring Severus into our confidence." The Dark Lord mused out loud. "It would be good to have an actual Potions Master complete the ritual potion."

Barty frowned, clearly unhappy at the idea of anyone else finding favour with the Dark Lord. "Father?"

"Tools, Bartemius," the Dark Lord reminded him, "and Severus is a wonderfully sharp implement when he's used correctly."

"He betrayed you!" Barty spluttered.

"No," the Dark Lord's red eyes glittered, "Severus has always been mine. It was I who placed him within Albus Dumbledore's circle and he who first informed me of the threat posed by Potter. I do not doubt that he continues to serve me, remaining close to the Potter boy and Dumbledore to ensure I have the best of intelligence. I saw for myself how much he despises the boy when I occupied Quirrell. I do not believe he realised that I was behind Quirrell's machinations."

Peter rather doubted that the Dark Lord was right about Snape's loyalty. Snape had loved Lily once and he wasn't completely certain that Snape hadn't known that the Dark Lord occupied Quirrell when he'd kept getting in between the Dark Lord and the Philosopher's Stone. He kept his thoughts to himself though.

"Yes," the Dark Lord mused again, "it is perhaps time to bring Severus into the circle."

"How will I approach him?" Barty asked somewhat sulkily.

"Knowing Severus, he will approach you through Karkaroff soon enough." The Dark Lord said, amused. "I look forward to your Yule present, Barty. I have forgiven you your mistakes to date but another failure may not go unpunished, my Heir."

"Yes, Father." Barty replied straight away.

The Dark Lord waved a tiny hand at Peter. "I am ready to retire."

Peter hurried to see to his Master, keeping his own mind busy with the details of ensuring the bed was turned down and the pillows comfortably positioned before he left the Dark Lord in the care of the snake. Peter reluctantly returned to the small living room.

Barty had gotten up off the floor and was sprawled on the sofa.

Peter ignored him and slid into his seat at the dining table, pulling the paper toward him to reread it once more.

"Do you believe him about Snape?" asked Barty into the stretching silence.

"If the Dark Lord says he is to be trusted, he is to be trusted." Peter replied evenly. "I don't question the Dark Lord." It made him the perfect choice as the willing servant, Peter thought to himself. The right tool for the right job; the Dark Lord had chosen correctly after all.

"What about if it protects him?" quibbled Barty, lurching to his feet and pacing back and forth.

Peter flipped the page. "Even then."

"I don't trust Snape." Barty growled. "He's in too deep with Dumbledore."

"That was his mission." Peter pointed out dryly. "He was meant to get in deep with Dumbledore so he could report to the Dark Lord with confidence." He lifted a shoulder. "I would say he was certainly more committed to the cause than you back in the day. After all, you only took the Mark because Rabastan asked you to, didn't you?"

Barty waved away Peter's remarks about his own loyalty. "And now?" He zeroed in on the opening Peter had left. "Do you say he's as committed as me now?"

"I doubt any of us are as committed as you now." Peter said dryly. Or needed committing, he mused silently, as Barty began laughing, bending double in his hysteria.

"You're funny, Pettigrew." He straightened eventually and wiped his eyes. "And about Snape?"

"If the Dark Lord believes he belongs to the Dark Lord then I'm certain that he has his reasons." Peter prevaricated.

"But?" pressed Barty, his eyes narrowing on Peter expectantly.

"But I know Snape loved Lily Potter at one point." Peter said succinctly. "Whether the fact that the Dark Lord killed her has changed anything for Snape…well, only he knows for certain." He raised a hand. "On the other hand, Snape hated James and Sirius with a vengeance. He hates Harry now; that much I know. The boys used to complain enough about his unfair treatment of him when I was living as the Weasleys' pet rat. Can I see him truly on the side which is now being led by Sirius Black and a Potter who looks like James?" He shrugged again.

Barty considered Peter's words and frowned heavily. "Thanks, Peter." He sighed and dropped back onto the sofa. "I need a good idea for Yule."

"Don't look at me." Peter said dismissively. "I'm crap at coming up with Christmas presents."

"I'd like another go at the Weasleys but if Fenrir has been given them…" Barty sighed. "Perhaps Potter's brand new girl friend? She's a muggleborn, isn't she? And it would be such a heartbreaking blow for our young hero." He pouted. "But that seems so cliché."

Peter kept his own counsel and tried not to think about anything but lunch.
