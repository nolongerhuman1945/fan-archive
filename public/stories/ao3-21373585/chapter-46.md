“...We’re going, aren’t we?”

Izuku looked over to Kyouka, folding the note back up and sliding it into his jacket pocket, “Do we have a choice?”

“In reality? Yes. Based on our record…No, we don’t.”

Izuku sighed, watching Kyoutoku pull up to the sidewalk in his car. They would hold off on revealing anything until shit stopped hitting the fan for five seconds. He turned around, looking through the automatic doors to see the receptionist at the front desk, wishing someone had seen who had left the letter. 

If Tomura even was the one who left it. If one of the other League members left it, then who else was watching them?

Before turning back, he couldn’t help but notice a colorful bandaid on the receptionist’s arm. Was that there before?

He shook his head, banishing the mindless thoughts from his mind. He needed to think, distract himself from really worrying. *“...Aldera.”*

Kyouka nodded, flinching only a little bit at the squeaking of her father’s brakes, *“Your middle school. Which means you were right, he’s learning. What do you think he’s getting at? Your past? Your quirklessness?”*

*“I don’t know, but maybe? He didn’t seem to care about One For All at the mall, so I don’t know why he would care about whether or not I had a quirk beforehand. But, first, let’s focus on how we’re going to get out of everyone’s sight when the time comes. I have a strong feeling that my mom and your parents are gonna be pretty attentive today.”*

*“We’ll figure it out.”* They stopped their hushed talk, getting into the car and driving off as the adults chatted. Izuku gazed out the window as the hospital went by, Kyouka’s jacks in his hand to muffle the noise, and so she could focus on the pulse point on his wrist.

But, as they turned the corner onto the main road, Izuku’s brow furrowed at what he saw. 

Near an exit to the nearby parking garage was the receptionist. How did she get there so fast? That bandaid on her arm was gone too.

She caught eyes with Izuku as they drove by. She smiled widely and waved them goodbye. Ignoring that her smile seemed oddly creepy, Izuku swore that just for a split-second, her eyes glinted yellow in the sunlight.

Izuku turned back in his seat, his stomach churning as convinced himself that it was just his paranoia. Kyouka heard his heartbeat quicken, her own heart dropping as she watched him rub his scars with an unshakeable focus. But, she could tell it wasn’t his scars that were bothering him. 

Kyouka rested her head against his shoulder, covering his hand in hers. They were desperately hoping that after camp, they would be out of the dark. 

But, it looked like there was no end in sight.

**(** **Some Time Later: Kamino Ward Police Station: Tsukauchi’s Office** **)**

  
  

“You alright?”

Toshinori looked up from his intense focus on his wringing hands. How long had he been doing that? Long enough to where his eyes had to readjust as blood rushed away from his face. He had sat alone in Tsukauchi’s office, getting some quiet from the hustle and bustle from the stressed officers.

Not to mention the shouts from Mrs. Bakugou, who refused to leave or calm down since the operation started. Not that he blamed her. 

Torino walked in, shutting the door behind him as he strode across the wood floor until reaching the chair in front of the desk. He sat down, leaning back as he awaited his student’s answer.

Toshinori shrugged, sinking further into the pool of cloth that was his costume, “About as well as I can be in a situation like this, I guess.”

“Mm, so terrible.”

“Kinda, yeah.”

“Mhm, thought so. You been to see the kids?”

“No, I’ve been practically trapped here. Young Midoriya’s already out of the hospital.” Toshinori mindlessly flicked his thumb through random papers and folders strewn about Tsukauchi’s desk, thinking back to the night of camp. “I should’ve been there. I was at home taking a God-damn bath and watching old westerns. I should have known something would happen. When does stuff *not* happen to us?”

“Yeah, well, you didn’t know and you weren’t there. Doesn’t matter much now, does it? Should you have been back at Nana’s house when All For One killed Yori?”

Toshinori raised his hand up, stopping Torino, “I get it. I’m not actually to blame, and I knew that already. It’s just…tough, you know?”

“What I know is that’s not the main thing on your mind.”

“...” Toshinori was silent, which was all the confirmation that Torino needed. He stared blindly down at the desk, damn near vomiting with how uneasy he felt. “...Promise me that whatever happens, you’ll watch over them? Midoriya and Jirou aren’t ready, no thanks to me.”

“Toshinori-”

“Promise me,” Toshinori reached across the desk and put his hand on his teacher’s shoulder, a pleading look in his eyes. *“...Please.”*

Sorahiko sighed, shaking his head, “Toshinori, you don’t seem to understand. If you fail, and All For One wins, there won’t be any promises to keep. We’re all done for. But…

Torino pulled out a folded paper from his pocket, passing it to Toshinori. His protege raised a brow as he took the paper and unfolded it, surprised to see what it was. “Is this…?”

“An application for my old teaching job back. Your position, actually. Only if somehow you both kill each other out there. Any other outcome and I’m rolling that into a cigar. But, you listen to me, Toshinori, and you listen well. I got my own promise to keep.”

“And what’s that?”

“I’m not allowed to outlive you. Nana’s orders. And if what you told me about her being in Midoriya’s head is true, then she’s gonna be pissed.”

“Hmhmhm! Fair enough. Although, you’re not the one that’s gonna be on the receiving end of it. You forget, I’m the one that’s gonna end up in Young Midoriya’s head next. I’ll die just for her to kill me again.”

Torino smiled, leaning forward on his cane, “You know, I can’t tell if that little bastard is lucky or unlucky to have her with him.”

“For him? Probably very helpful. For me? Imagine having your own mother in your head twenty-four/seven.”

“Yeesh, nevermind. Point taken.”

“Hehehe. But, I gotta admit. I am a little jealous. Even for just one conversation…” 

“I know.” Torino stood up, turning back to walk to the door. “One more thing, Toshinori. This time, you don’t have a choice. I’m gonna be there this time. I’m fully aware that my presence may be more of a detriment than helpful, but if I see an opening on that bastard, I’m taking it.”

Toshinori smiled, relenting with a nod of his head, “If he’s there.”

Torino made it to the door, a sigh escaping his lips as he turned the doorknob, “We both know he will be.”

He opened the door, finding Aizawa leaning against the wall across from them. He looked up from the floor, a brow raised, “My turn?”

“All yours,” Torino grumbled as he walked away, leaving Shouta to catch the door before it closed.

Aizawa walked in, yanking his tie away from his neck as he approached the desk. “God-damn straight-jackets.” 

“Hmhmhm. Still handling the press?” Toshinori nodded at Shouta’s gray suit as he sat down across from him. 

“I’m pretty sure you mean fighting off the vultures.”

“Same thing.”

“Hm,” Shouta reached into his breast pocket, pulling out a flask and taking a swig.

“When did you get that?”

“This morning,” Aizawa grumbled, sliding it across the table to Toshinori.

“Thanks, but I can’t-”

“Can’t drink alcohol, I know. It’s coffee.”

“Eh, well I’m supposed to limit my caffeine intake too, but…Ah, to Hell with it.” Toshinori took a swig from the flask, cringing at the lukewarm, definitely instant coffee as it ran down his throat. “Jesus, that’s…something.”

“Mm, I know, but it keeps me up.”

“Keeps you up? For a guy that seemingly sleeps fourteen out of the twenty-four hours in a day, you always seem tired.”

“I’ve slept a max of six hours in the last three days. Once Bakugou’s back, I’ll crash for a week straight.”

“You should at least nap now. The raid doesn’t start for a few more hours.”

Aizawa shook his head, putting the flask back into his jacket pocket, “Couldn’t if I wanted to. He was taken on my watch. Whatever happens tonight is on me.”

“Hey, I just got the same talk. You couldn’t command the world to move in your favor. We were all caught off guard. We’ll make it right.”

Aizawa mostly ignored the comment, and Toshinori didn’t blame him. He had heard promises like that before, and sometimes artificial hope wasn’t what some people wanted. “...You know it’s gonna be absolute Hell once we try to start school back up.”

Toshinori nodded, rubbing his eyes, “We’ll have to pull off quite a few miracles to get even half of our students back.”

“Exactly. Nezu already said that we’re all gonna have to split up into groups and go house-to-house to try and convince the parents. I think I’ll jump out into moving traffic if I have to spend six-plus hours in a car with Mic all day.”

“Mhmhmhm. Well, what about Nemuri?”

“The day of the attack, she went on vacation to Martinuque.”

“Ah, that’s right. I remember her mentioning that. Hm, that’s funny. Downstairs, Mt. Lady has been complaining about how she should’ve been on a plane to Martinique by now. Small world.”

Aizawa nodded lazily, clearly tired despite the caffeine running through his veins, “I say we save each other and partner up.”

Toshinori tried to respond, but he stopped himself. A part of him was saying just to agree and move on, but something else was itching him. Torino was going to be at the raid, and there was no talking him out of it. What if both didn’t make it back? If there was ever a back-up plan…

“I…I gotta tell you…There’s no time to fully explain, but I…There’s a good chance I’m not coming back tonight.” 

Shouta’s brow furrowed, turning his perplexed gaze over to his coworker, “What the hell are you talking about? I’ve faced the new League members, and unless they have another Nomu like the one at the USJ, you’ll bulldoze them like nothing. You’ve got nothing to worry about.”

Toshinori shook his head, sighing deeply, “Not them. I don’t know for certain, but I think I know who their boss is. He’s worse. He’s much, much, much worse than anything you, or anybody on this Earth, has ever seen.”

“...You’re serious?”

Toshinori pressed his hand over his clothes, directly over where his wound was, “He’s the one that did this.”

“...Shit. You knew he was still out there?”

“No,” Toshinori shook his head, “Not until recently. I thought I killed him, but he’s a cockroach. He has the means of surviving damn near anything. I won the battle, but I fear tonight I may lose the war.”

Aizawa leaned forward, peering at his coworker, “...Why are you telling me this now?”

“Because if I die, you may be approached to help with something I’ve been a part of. I can’t say what, or who’s involved. It’s not my place anymore. If you’re not, you’re gonna have to act like this conversation never happened. But, I just…I just felt you deserved to be prepared. Now, excuse me, but I have a couple calls to make.”

Shouta nodded, getting up from his seat and making his way towards the door. As Aizawa put his hand on the doorknob, he paused, not looking back at Toshinori. “...Midoriya and Jirou.”

Toshinori didn’t respond, leaving the fate of any of Aizawa’s questions to his proteges. His coworker left, leaving Toshinori to dial Izuku’s number. After a few rings, Izuku picked up, *“Hey, All Might. Is something wrong? Er-...I mean, besides everything.”*

“Ah, my boy. Thank goodness. I’m so sorry I couldn’t make it to the hospital after you awoke.”

*“Don’t worry about it. I’m fine; Kacchan is more important right now, despite what Kyouka might say.”*

*“Hey!”* Toshinori heard Kyouka shout in the background, *“I hate him, but I’m not evil! Also, hey All Might.”*

“Hmhmhm, good to hear from you too, Young Jirou. Clean bills of health from both of you, I hope?”

*“We’re fine, All Might. We know the real reason you’re calling...”*

“I…” Toshinori sighed, leaning back into the chair to stare up at the ceiling. “...I just wanted to speak to you two before I go out there. We all know what’s probably waiting for me tonight.”

*“We do,”* Kyouka’s voice came over, becoming louder as she got closer to Izuku’s phone, *“And you’re gonna kick his ass again.”*

“Easie-”

*“Easier said than done, blah-blah-blah. No. Remember what you promised me back in Hosu? You promised to stop thinking of yourself as this human shield for our problems and fight for yourself too.”*

“...If I remember correctly, I specifically said I couldn’t promise anything.”

*“You said you’d try, so I’m struggling to find the difference.”*

*“I’m with Kyouka on this one,”* Izuku backed her up. *“But, if you’re that worried about it, then do one thing for me.”*

“What’s that, my boy?”

*“...Win.”*

“...Did you just Rocky II me?”

*“...Yeah.”*

“My boy, I’ve never been prouder than I am right now.” 

He heard Kyouka sigh as Izuku chuckled, *“Dudes are so strange.”*

“You’ll understand, Young Jirou. Because if I die, my entire film collection has to go somewhere, and I’m assigning Young Midoriya the job of showing you a very specific list of classics.”

*“You’re serious?”*

“It’s in my will!”

*\*Knock-Knock\**

“Hey,” Toshinori turned around, seeing Tsukauchi in the doorway, bulletproof vest donned. “We’re meeting in the lobby.”

“Yeah, I…I’m coming. Just a sec.” Toshinori began to pace frantically as Tsukauchi left, running a hand through his hair as he began spewing out stuff as fast as he could. “Uh, okay, what else? Um, oh! Nezu has my will. He’s also a lawyer, who knew? Obviously a portion of my money is split up among different charities, but you guys get the rest.”

*“All Mig-”*

“If you end up not wanting to be heroes you’ll never have to work a day in your lives. Anything I forget to mention in the will, my One For All ghost will sort the rest out.”

*“All Might?”*

“Oh, the keys to my truck are in my house. My house keys are back in my desk at UA, Nezu will get them for you. You’ll also find a book of contacts, mainly from America. It’ll be tough with the long-distance and all, but if you really need to, call David. I’d rather keep him out of all this, but he might become essential. Although, I guess to be fair, if All For One wins, all rules are off the table.”

*“All Might!” / “All Might!”*

“What?!”

Izuku took a deep breath before continuing, knowing they were still really dodging around each other. *“All Might, you’re coming back. I saw you fight him before. I saw everything you did that night, which means that you know even more than I do that All For One feels one thing about you that he’s never felt about anyone before. He’s afraid of you. You scared him into hiding for thirty more years, and into finding what I have to assume is a successor in Shigaraki. Which I have to also assume means that you destroyed him beyond what his agelessness can maintain. He’d have no reason to find somebody else otherwise. Nothing’s changed. You were better than him before, and you’re better now.”*

“Young Midoriya…”

*“I still have a lot to learn from you. You still have a lot of work to do on Lady Nagant’s case. I saw everything leading up to where you are today, and I think you’re still owed a life for yourself. Not to mention Nana’s going to be incredibly angry if you die. You’re not gonna have fun up in my head. I’d agree with her, I’d much rather have you down here with us. With your…E-Eh, well…I mean your-...”*

*“Your family,”* Kyouka finished for him. *“He means your family. Meaning us, by the way, just in case you’re both this emotionally blocked-up.”*

*“Real rich coming from you.”/* “Real rich coming from you.”

*“Wh-?! Hey, I…True, but still.”*

*“She’s right though,”* Izuku kept going. *“And, to top it all off, you’re coming back because…Kyouka and I kind of have something important to tell you once this is over.”*

Toshinori’s brow furrowed as he leaned back against the desk, “That’s…ominous. How important?”

*“Game-changing,”* Kyouka chuckled. *“Very game-changing. It’s a development you’re not going to want to miss, so you’re gonna have to win the fight to hear it.”*

“Alright! Alright, message received. Losing isn’t allowed. I get it, and…Thank you. Really, I…Sometimes I think back on how miserable my life would have been like if I hadn’t met you, Young Midoriya. Then, and forgive me for saying this, but I definitely didn’t expect you to get a girlfriend in the first week of school.”

*“Trust me, I didn’t either.”*

*“I was the one in love with him, and I didn't even think that would happen,”* Kyouka agreed with a chuckle.

“At first, I thought it could complicate things, but now I couldn’t have been more grateful. I found two young heroes that changed my whole world. That’s where I’ll find the will to win this battle. I want to hear this so-called ‘game-changing news’. I want to see you kids graduate, form your agency. And, forgive me for flustering you two for what could be my last time, but I’m making it my oath to see you get married.”

*“Wh-What?! I-I mean, not that I haven’t th-thought about it, but we have t-to graduate first.” / “Whoa, hey! Let’s settle down. I-I mean, yeah, obviously, but still. Give us some time.”*

“Ah, I hear wedding bells already. I’ve gotta go, but…Proud is an understatement. Words alone can’t do you kids justice. So, I suppose, I’ll just have to let my actions speak for myself when I return. Okay, I really have to g-”

*“Wait, All Might!”* Izuku stopped him, faltering on his next words. *“I…It’s just that…I…You can’t tell anyone this, but Kacchan isn’t going to be at the bar.”*

“...Excuse me?”

*“He’s not going to be there, so be careful of any kind of trap. You can’t tell anyone else he won’t be there, or else things could go very, very bad.”*

Toshinori was absolutely confused by that point, turning back to make sure Tsukauchi wasn’t waiting outside the door or anything. “...How do you know this?”

*“We…We can’t say that either. We’ll be fine, just…trust us, okay?”*

“I…I do. Good luck.”

*“You, too.” / “You, too.”*

Toshinori ended the call, still not exactly comfortable with this new situation. But, he wasn’t lying, he trusted them. Whatever happened, whatever they knew, he had faith they would pull through. 

Bakugou was apparently their responsibility now. Which, to be honest, made him breathe a little easier.

He’d have his hands plenty full tonight.

  
  
  
  
  

***…~AIV~...***

  
  
  

**(** **Kyouka’s Room** **)**

  
  

Kyouka sighed as she flopped down on her bed, dreading the ever-approaching setting sun. “Are we sure not telling him is a good idea?”

Izuku shook his head, pacing back and forth across the room, “He won’t be able to resist. He’ll try to help in some way, and I really don’t want to try and call Shigaraki’s bluff. It won’t end well for us.”

Kyouka threw her arm over her eyes, “I know. What are we saying to our parents?”

  
“Nothing,” Izuku replied, grabbing a notebook off of Kyouka’s piano. “We’ll leave a note saying we wanted some alone time at the beach.”

“What if they come looking for us?”

I don’t think it’s gonna matter. They won’t know where we are, and that’s the whole idea.”

“Mm, easier to ask for forgiveness than permission…If we survive to ask.”

“I’m far more afraid for Kacchan. He’s made it pretty apparent that he doesn’t want us dead. If we upset him, he’ll likely just kill Kacchan and leave with the portal guy. One thing is for absolute certainty though. We should try to keep this split a secret. If he attacks, leave Shigaraki to me.”

“I only promise to not use One For All unless you’re about to die.”

“Deal.”

“Now, I get not telling him where we’ll be, but…do you regret not telling him anything else? Specifically, maybe how you feel about his role in your life?”

Izuku chuckled a bit, but ultimately shook his head. “No need. Not today, that is. He’s gonna win, Kyouka. I’ve watched the memories, seen him fight. If you saw All Might not even hesitate after All For One ripped his stomach open, and then *still* won, you’d understand what I mean. His body may not be the same, but his spirit is even stronger than before.”

Kyouka lifted her head up, raising a brow at him, “What makes you say that?”

“...He’s got us. He has his students. He has hope of shining a light on what happened to Lady Nagant. The All Might I watched fight All For One the first time felt like he had nothing to lose, except Torino. It’s different now. I know, because it’s the same thing I realized about myself after I watched that fight. In a year’s time, I went from somebody who felt like they had nothing to lose, to someone who had absolutely everything to lose. People always say to fear a man with nothing to lose, but the same goes for someone who has everything to lose, and is willing to do anything to keep it safe. That’s how it is for me, and it’s the same for him.”

“...You know, maybe it’s my brain trying to distract myself from the sweat-inducing, stomach churning stress…Okay, that’s exactly what it is, but I can’t help but find that oddly sweet.”

Izuku smiled, also happy for the distraction, “Well, ‘everything’ can be defined as ‘Kyouka, and then the rest’.”

“Mm, c’mere and distract me from stress-vomiting, you charming bastard.”

Izuku didn’t need to be told twice as he moved to the bed, tossing the notebook near the pillows. Their arms coiled around each other as they sank into the blankets, with Kyouka sighing as she buried her face into the crook of Izuku’s neck. “Just to be clear, I’d do anything to keep you safe, you know?”

“I’m fully aware.” Izuku kissed the top of her head, “Although, I’ll try and do the same thing you do for me, and make sure you don’t go too crazy with it.”

“Ah, but that’s our specialty.”

“Our accidental specialty.”

“Hmhmhm, exactly.” Kyouka sighed against Izuku’s skin, hugging him tighter. “But, for now, let’s just pretend like the world might not end by sunrise.”

“...You know, we won’t have to leave for a couple more hours. If you want to forget about things, pretend nothing’s wrong, my mom is still downstairs with your parents. The plan was to stay until after dinner, so…my apartment is empty.”

“...Wow.”

“It’s just a suggestion!”

“...You really think we can pull that off?”

  
  
  
  

***…~AIV~...***

  
  
  

**(** **Two Hours Later: Near Aldera Junior High** **)**

  
  

Izuku’s stomach grew more uneasy the closer and closer they got to Aldera. They had left the note on Kyouka’s bed and snuck out her window. If Mika had heard them at any point, she thankfully let it slide. 

The couple were eternally grateful for their time alone in Izuku’s bedroom. Tomura, All For One, the camp attack, One For All, none of it was spoken of over the next couple of hours. Not that they did much talking…

But, time conquers all, and there they were on the road to Aldera.

His apartment was walking distance from the school, so they forewent the train. It wasn’t a *short* walk, per say, but the couple had subconsciously agreed to take the longer option; give them time to think, talk.

…Totally not stall whatsoever.

They were clearly talking about the most important topics, completely related to the situation at hand, and not distracting themselves from every bad possibility that awaited them.

“Izuku, I would never ask you to not put your All Might posters back up, but it took us ten minutes to take them down. If we ever wanna do stuff in your room again, I’m just saying it’ll save us some time.”

“To be fair, it only took us ten minutes because of the limited edition ones. I needed to find a proper way to store them so they wouldn’t crease.”

“Can we at least agree that whenever we move in together, you get a dedicated memorabilia room or section in the house? Outside of the bedroom?”

“Deal. But, I…Huh.”

“What?”

Izuku turned away from her, walking towards the nearby guard rail. He looked down into the concrete canal running under the street, barren of water outside of tiny puddles here and there. He gazed around at the cherry blossoms, concrete fences, and houses lining the road. 

Yep, this was definitely the spot.

“This is where I met All Might,” Izuku nodded down at the canal as Kyouka moved to stand next to him. “I walked under this bridge and found that slime monster. Or, rather he found me, I guess.”

“I thought you said this was the scenic route? Pretty out of the way from your building.”

“Eh, I wasn’t exactly keen on going home that day.”

“Hm? Why didn’t you wanna go home?”

Izuku scoffed, moving away from the railing, “I didn’t want to be *anywhere* .”

Kyouka turned around as Izuku continued their journey, “Bad day?”

“Yeah, but that doesn’t matter,” Izuku waved off the question, shoving his hands back into the pockets of his black denim jacket; something Kyouka insisted on buying him. Not that he complained. “We gotta focus. It’s almost seven.”

Kyouka jogged to catch up to him, nudging him once she reached his side, “I have a feeling that’s not the only memory coming back to you, based on our destination.”

Izuku furrowed his brow, a shake of his head, “Why? Why Aldera? He figured out where I went to middle school, so what? What game is he playing where this *has* to be where we bargain for Kacchan’s life?”

“Maybe that’s exactly it. Bakugou. Maybe he figured out you two-”

“Kacchan would never admit to that. Even in the face of death, he’s too prideful to give a villain anything. He’d rather die than give a villain the time of day, much less any details of our past. He wouldn’t give either of us away like that.”

“Who ever said Bakugou said anything? Maybe Shigaraki found something on his own.”

“Kacchan was never formally written up, much less reprimanded. There’s no evidence of anything, so I don’t know what he could possibly find.”

Kyouka grimaced, her blood boiling at just another piece of information that not only made her heart ache for the younger Izuku, but become filled with unyielding rage for Bakugou, his lackeys, and every other bastard that attended or worked in that damned school. “I hope Bakugou is fully aware of the dramatic irony that it’s you that’s about to save his life.”

They turned the corner, Aldera finally coming into view. Izuku’s stomach dropped as something caught his eye on the rooftop. Tomura stood atop the building in the dead center. A cuffed and straightjacket-bound Katsuki stood next to him, Tomura’s hand wrapped around his neck. Tomura was without his hands, except for the one on his face; his black peacoat blowing in the wind.

The rooftop, of all places…

“Trust me, Kyouka. He has no idea…”

“Right on time!” Tomura raised his hands out, yelling into the air as the couple approached the front gates below. The streets were empty, the moon and a few vacant streetlights brightening the area. They were alone. “I’ll meet you downstairs. Just walk through the door, and the tour will begin!”

The teens shared a look, both thinking the same thing, *‘The tour?’*

“What the-?! What the hell are you two doing here?!” Katsuki shouted as he looked down to see who Tomura had addressed. “Get the hell away from he-Agh!” 

Katsuki suddenly kicked forward, leaning far off the ledge of the building. He was only saved by Tomura, who held a chain attached to the teen’s back. Tomura chuckled, “Don’t want this gift horse to bite you now, do we?”

“Enough!” Izuku yelled up at them, “You said you’d give him back, and that you wanted to talk!”

“Ah, never specified you’d get him back alive!” Tomura laughed, yanking Bakugou back up onto the roof and letting him fall next to him. “I’m kidding! Kidding! You’re right. Just come on inside so we can start!”

“Start what?!” But, Tomura had walked away from the ledge, vanishing from sight with Katsuki in tow. Izuku growled under his breath, “Stay close. We don’t have any leverage, so he has no reason to keep up his end of whatever this deal is. As far as we know, the other League members are in there.”

“No, it’s just them.”

“How do you know?”

Kyouka’s jacks perked up, aiming at the school, “Getting the hang of my new level of hearing. It’s only their heartbeats and breathing in there. Bakugou is swearing under his breath *a lot* .”

“...And how hard are you actually trying to listen in right now?”

“Mm, not much.”

“...Damn it, you’re so cool. C’mon.”  

They stepped onto the school grounds, making their way towards a decayed front door. Kyouka looked around, thinking of a slightly younger Izuku roaming the place, “So, your old stomping ground…”

Izuku hummed in response, “If by ‘stomping ground’ you mean the place where I was literally stomped into the ground for years, then sure.”

Kyouka frowned, glaring up at the building, “Hey, when we’re super successful from being two of the highest ranking heroes in the world, can we buy this place to tear it down?”

“Kyouka…”

“Just a suggestion.”

“...Maybe.”

“Hmhm, awesome.” 

They stepped inside, and Izuku was thrown back to nearly two years ago. It wasn’t that he was expecting it to look all that different, it was only a couple years back that he was here, but he was admittedly surprised at how nothing had changed at all. Same gray tiles on the floor, same beige walls, same black lockers sectioned across the front foyer for the first-years. 

The exact same dread he felt everyday walking through the doors.

“Okay, Kyouka, have you ever heard of Pinocchio? Really old Western story from centuries ago.”

“Rings a bell. Really random, but I assume there’s a purpose to this.”

“Listen to Shigaraki’s heartbeat. Anytime he lies, extend your jacks.”

“Okay. I will say that this trick doesn’t work on everybody.”

“I know, just do your best. Even if he’s completely truthful, we have to take every word, syllable, and letter with the tiniest grain of salt.”  

“Got it. So, are we supposed to keep going, or…?” As in on command, a black vortex swirled to life down the hallway, with Katsuki being shoved out first. The rattling of the buckles and chains containing him bounced off the walls as he stumbled forward, Tomura soon coming out after him. “Hey! You’re not alone, we know those portals come from your friend!”

“Let’s just calm down,” Tomura raised his free hand in defense. “Kurogiri isn’t here. He’s watching from the security system. It’s my assurance that I can leave unfollowed. I explicitly told him to leave us be. Tonight he’s my taxi, and nothing more.”

Izuku glanced down at Kyouka’s jacks, seeing no movement. He wasn’t breathing easy, but it was perhaps just a little less difficult. “Fine, then. Why are we here?”

“Pfft, I thought you wanted him back?”

“I meant *here.* Aldera.”

“...I didn’t exactly go to normal school, so I didn’t know this. But, did you know that they keep all of your records for a few years after you graduate?” Tomura reached into his coat, pulling out and flaunting a folder in the air, Izuku’s name boldly printed on the top. “I learned quite a bit, but a lot of it I had to infer based on certain implications. So, I’m gonna need you and my little partner here to help Jirou and I fill in the blanks!”

“This is what you wanted to talk about? My middle school days? What does any of this matter to you?”

“Oh, to me? If I’m right about all this, a whole lot. To Jirou, I’m sure she knows quite a bit, but this should be very eye-opening for her.” Tomura turned to Kyouka, waving the folder again. “C’mon, deny it all you want, but we both know you’re curious, even more than me.”

Kyouka didn’t respond to that, knowing that denying it was a fruitless effort. It didn’t mean she had to give him the satisfaction of saying yes, either. “If we go through with whatever this is, you’ll let us all go? Bakugou included? *Alive?”*

“Pfft, I’m not keeping you. You two can leave whenever you want, I won’t stop ya. But, yes, I’ll let him go. I have no intentions of killing you today. In fact, by the end of this, I hope I’ll be able to avoid killing you at any point in the future.”

“Oh, great. First the blondie, and now you. How many other League members wanna be our friend?”

“Sure, friendship is all Toga wants from you. Let’s go with that,” Tomura scoffed, yanking Katsuki to the side and motioning for the couple to move down the hallway ahead of him. “Welcome, Lady, Gentleman, and Bakugou, to Tomura’s Tour of Trauma.”

…Oh boy.

“You first,” Kyouka nodded ahead. “You’re the supposed tour guide, after all.”

“Hmhm, fair point. Alright, first stop.” He shoved ever-silent Katsuki down the hall by the neck, his pinkie continuously tapping his throat, practically daring anyone to make a move. They walked down the hallway, turning to the left at the first intersection. The first two doors on the right of the hall was where Tomura stopped first, kicking in the door. 

Kyouka scoffed, raising an unamused brow at Tomura, “You gotta go that badly?”

“Ha! Nah, nah, this is our first stop. Hey, Bakugou, hold the door open for us, will ya?” Tomura shoved Katsuki against the door, using his body to push it open. 

“Enough…” Izuku warned him, but Tomura ignored the teen as he kept Katsuki pressed against the door. Tomura held his folder to his chest to flip it open. 

“Now let’s see here…Ah, there we go. Student was found hiding in the bathroom stalls during class. Sent to nurse’s office after teacher noticed a smell of vomit. Student apparently became ill, but denied multiple times.” Tomura sucked in between his teeth, turning to Izuku, “Vomiting and hiding during class? Lemme guess, stress-vomiting? Something you were afraid of facing in class?... *Someone?”*

Kyouka’s eyes flickered up to Izuku, finding him completely emotionless. His past was already a subject he hated talking about, only opening up to her in specific and preferably comfortable settings. Being back in his old personal Hell of a middle school, in front of his past tormentor, *and* someone who was most likely destined to be his mortal enemy…

Yeah, it was safe to say that Izuku was both internally crumbling and internally seething with the rage of a million infernos.

“Quite the stretch, don’t you think?” Kyouka deadpanned up at Tomura.

“Maybe. Buuut…” Tomura slightly lifted his finger that kept the papers together, letting a paperclipped stack fall to the ground. “That right there is how many times it was reported. Seven times, all different days, some different months, and that’s only the times he got caught, I assume?”

Izuku’s gaze moved to Katsuki briefly, finding the captive eyeing him strangely. He knew it was far too much to hope that it was some sort of guilt, and rather disbelief. 

“What can I say? Bad immune system.” Izuku grabbed the papers, ripped them up and threw them in the nearby garbage can before stepping back out into the hall, Kyouka sticking close to his side. 

“Hmhmhm, how ‘bout that?” Tomura followed, Katsuki in tow, as they moved down the hallway. “We can walk-and-talk as we go to our next destination. Student has been questioned over the smoky aroma coming from him on multiple different occasions, and reminded that cigarettes are strictly prohibited on school property, and illegal for his age. I have a strong feeling you’ve never smoked a day in your life.”

“...”

“What about you, Bakugou? I’m sure you cause a lot of second-hand smoke, huh? Although, the term is far more literal in terms of what you did.”

“Go fuck youse-MMPH!!!” 

“Shut up,” Tomura rolled his eyes as he jammed one of the reports into Katsuki’s mouth, turning back to his other guests. “Anyway, our next stop needs some context as well. This right here isn’t a student report, but a receipt. Pretty recent, too. An order form for a locker replacement. And, after looking through the records, lo and behold whose locker is it? I’ll give you all one guess.”

Kyouka sighed, knowing she was the one that would have to answer him, “The point, please?”

“Right. You might be wondering, what does it matter? It’s just a locker. Besides, if they replaced it then the locker is gone anyway, right? Ah, but let me direct you all to the first floor storage rooms.”

Tomura led them towards what Izuku remembered was the gym, but cut left before the main doors and to a dead-end side wing of rooms he didn’t think he had ever been in. At the end was a door with an already half-decayed lock on the ground before it. 

Izuku was well aware of what awaited him inside. The image of his locker was forever burned into the wrinkles of his brain until the day he died, but that didn’t mean he wanted to ever see it again, much less have anyone else see it. 

He knew that as much as Kyouka was thankfully focused on the task at hand, she was realizing just how many memories Izuku kept in his mental vault. 

“Okay, here we go.” Tomura pushed the door open with Katsuki, moving into a dusty old room filled with spare desks stacked in the corner, gym mats, shelves of old supplies, trash cans, and yes, a group of torn out lockers. “You gotta love people too lazy to get rid of their garbage. Ah, well, guess I’ve got no room to talk. Jirou, open that for me, will you?”

Kyouka sighed, continuing to play along. She walked over to the black lockers on the floor leaning against the wall, looking back at Izuku, “Which one?”

It was Izuku’s turn to sigh, side-eyeing Tomura before answering, “...Four-Four-Two. First to the right.”

Kyouka’s jack hooked around the mechanism, sliding it up and swinging the door open…

…And her heart shattered.

*~Useless! Deku. Quirkless Freak. Nobody. Nothing. Worthless. Deku. Don’t bother. Deku. Deku. Deku. Deku. Deku. Deku. Quirkless. You’re gonna die in the Entrance Exams. Deku. Deku.~*

Every word carved into the back of the locker made her want to…to…she didn’t know.

Turn around and punch Katsuki through the school? Quake the entire building into rubble? Hunt down every person who wrote a single letter in that locker? All of the above? 

Yeah, all of the above. 

Kyouka turned around, her heart pounding in her ears as her glare threatened to pierce right through Katsuki. His gaze met hers, growling back, “Don’t look at me. I didn’t write a God-damn word of that.”

“Funny thing is, I believe you. Not your style. But, who do you think inspired everyone who did write this stuff? What’s to blame for a wildfire? The flame, or the spark that started it all? Or, perhaps, the world that lit your spark to begin with.” Tomura moved them over and kicked away a rolling cabinet to his left, revealing a bunch of old student desks. “You wanna know what is your style? Look at what else I found. The one on the left there look familiar?”

Izuku didn’t need to look, but Kyouka couldn’t help herself. She looked down at the desk, a large scorch mark burned evident against the bright wood. 

“But, Tomura, you say,” The young man continued, dragging Katsuki along as he theatrically paced behind the desk. “What if this is Bakugou’s desk? Why don’t you look a little closer, Jirou? On the side here.”

Tomura swiveled the desk around, the front of it facing Kyouka. Etched into the side of the desktop was “Deku”, proving it to be Izuku’s former desk. 

“What point are you trying to make?” Izuku finally spoke up, clearly aggravated beyond belief at this point. “Is this supposed to be some sort of joke? Are you trying to torture me or something? Because, I’m sorry to disappoint, but this isn’t exactly wearing me down if that’s what you’re going for. That’s not even bringing up my biggest question of why me?”

“...Jirou, ya mind?” Tomura nodded to Katsuki, tapping his folder against the teen’s ears. “I’d do it myself, but my hand on his neck is basically the only leverage I have here. Besides, I don’t think you guys want me touching him any more than I am.”

With a roll of her eyes, Kyouka’s jack shot out and plugged into Katsuki’s ears, leaving them to talk in “private,” much to Katsuki’s irritation. 

“Speak, Crusty.”

“Youch, okay. Anyway, I would suggest not asking questions that put your little act at risk. We all know why I chose you, but our friend here doesn’t. So, unless you want to start explaining One For All to him, I think we should avoid questions like that.”

“He’s already going to question why you chose us,” Kyouka scoffed. “We’ll need a lie.”

“Not really my problem,” Tomura shrugged. “We should head to our final stop though. We’ll all want time to watch the show.”

Izuku furrowed his brow, “The show?”

“The latest fight of the century. We both have stakes in the two fighters. I know who I’m betting on though.” He turned back to the door, with Kyouka retracting her jacks from Katsuki’s ears. “Okay, last stop and we all *probably* get to go home.”

They exited the storage room, except this time with no idle chatter from Tomura. It was almost as if he knew that letting everyone stew on all this new information would just make it worse. Kyouka knew she had to focus, but she couldn’t help but squeeze Izuku’s hand. She wanted to do so much more, but they had to make it out of this.

Tomura led them to the stairway back at the hallway’s intersection, but Kyoua’s eye caught something through the back entrance doors. Behind the school sat a fountain, which wasn’t odd on its own, but a memory flew back to her from many months ago.

*~"Is that one of the notebooks you told me about?"*

*…..*

 *"O-Oh, yeah" Izuku said, a little embarrassed as he continued to skim through the book.*

 *Kyouka saw the cover of the notebook and looked at Izuku questioningly, "Volume 13 2.0?"*

 *"This is the second version of that volume. The original was uh... destroyed."*

 *Kyouka saw how Izuku said that and squinted at him, breaking him down with her look alone, "Destroyed how?"*

 *"It's nothing, I-" Izuku tried to deflect the question, but Kyouka's gaze was unwavering. Besides, he said he didn't want to lie to her. He doubted he could have anyway. "...Kacchan blew it up and threw it in a fountain."~*

*…..*

Kyouka’s scowl deepened, doing everything she could to calm herself down. Now that she had an ultra-powered body she had no idea how to control, the last thing she wanted was to accidentally collapse the entire school down on top of them. 

Here they were again, risking their asses to save this motherfucker for the second time in seventy-two hours. 

If Shigaraki was trying to turn her against Katsuki, she was way ahead of him by a longshot. But, he was definitely turning her already well embedded hate for the guy into a repugnant, vile loathing. 

Perhaps it was Izuku getting to her, but it felt wrong for her to feel such intense hatred. It felt against her nature, like a poison. But, what else were you supposed to feel for the person that caused the one you love over a decade of pain, loneliness, depression.

It was a reality of Kyouka knowing that if things had gone even a little differently, Izuku might not be the same person that she loved or they could have never met. Yet, she wished so badly things had gone differently for him. 

Deep down though, if she really was Izuku’s first friend? The first person in years to show him kindness like that? She’d take that mantle proudly and selfishly. 

She’d save Katsuki tonight, and she’d do it again if the need ever arose. However, her tolerance had officially bottomed out.   

They trekked up three more flights of stairs until they were at the roof access door. Tomura shoved Katsuki against the door to open it, allowing him to take a deep breath of the cold night air. “Ah, finally. It smelled like anxiety and puberty sweat down there.”

“Uh-huh,” Kyouka deadpanned, tired of hearing him talk. “The point, please? Finally?”

Tomura didn’t respond, instead flipping to the last page of his folder.

“Student has been seen multiple times going up to the rooftop. He has been warned more than once, and maintenance has been assigned the task of placing locks on the roof access door.” Tomura waved the papers up at them. He wasn’t smiling or sneering; he wasn’t mocking Izuku. He was deadly serious. “Why’d you come up here so many times? Nice little hangout spot? Alone time? I mean…not like you had a quirk to help you if you fell.”

“As we’ve clearly seen tonight, I didn’t get much alone time at school,” Izuku shrugged. “Where else was I supposed to go?”

“Fair enough, I suppose. But, look...” Tomura raised the folder up, lowering his pinkie down and disintegrating the folder into dust, allowing it to fly away in the wind. He removed the hand on his face, hooking the fingers around his belt loops. “You don’t have to go into that. Don’t you get it now, though? You got through it all. You proved yourself. You proved that you’re *better* than them, all of them. Especially *him.* ”

Tomura shoved Katsuki to his knees, with Izuku taking a step forward, a watchful eye on Tomura’s raised pinkie, “I’m not trying to prove I’m better than anyone.”

“Isn’t that the whole point of the hero ranking system? You wanna be number one, right?”

“W-Well, yeah, bu-”

“Don’t you understand the kind of influence you could have? You’re the only one that’s been on the other side, that’s actually suffered under the constant, unspoken beatings that the hero world has created. Yet, you join them? You’re so happy to be a part of the world that *hated you.* Or, maybe not even past-tense. You, Jirou, have a mutation quirk. Don’t tell me you haven’t seen all the shit all over the internet about mutations. Has it happened to you? Have people beaten you down for your appearance? Has it ever made you hate yourself? If it did, trust me, I know the feeling. You both do! It’s no wonder you two are together, huh?”

“Enough,” Kyouka shook her head, trying to ignore his words. “You don’t know us.”

“Of course not. Not completely. But, I know the world, what it's capable of doing to us. What people like him…” Tomura nodded down to Katsuki, an almost disgusted look on his face, “...can do to us.”

“You say that like we’re supposed to relate to you,” Izuku peered at him, “You’ve done all this, thrown my past in my face, but we don’t know your story.”

“Ohoho, sorry, but I can’t give that away. But, I know what it’s like to be abused for nothing. And, like you, it all roots back to heroes, quirks, all of it. I really don’t understand why you two would idolize the world that hated you. Midoriya, they only liked you after you got the power. Jirou? Well, a lot of people probably still don’t like you. But, you’ll just roll over like dogs because it’s your dream?”

“What exactly is it that you want from us?”

“I…I don’t know yet. That’s what I was hoping you two would help me with. I’ll admit, my mind has been so frantic on this, but I think…I think it’d be nice to live in a world where stories like ours don’t have to happen, right? Don’t you agree? I think that together, we could come up with something big.”

“Uh-huh, sure,” Kyouka rolled her eyes, crossing her arms. “You want us to leave our lives and homes to help out a grungy villain and his lackeys who tried to kill us, our friends, kidnapped our classmate, who admitted to having no plan. What an amazing bargain.”

“I wasn’t here to recruit you. I’m no miracle worker, even I’d be incredibly impressed with myself. I’m just here to plant the seed, give you something to think about. One day, we’ll revisit this, and maybe you’ll see things a little more my way. Or, you’ll double down and sink further into the cocoon of ignorance you’ve put yourselves in…” He plugged Katsuki’s ears, smirking at Izuku, “…and then we’ll be back to the original plan of killing each other for our masters’ entertainment.”

Izuku kept glancing down at Kyouka’s jacks, and she hadn’t extended them the entire time. He wasn’t sure if he was supposed to be relieved by that or not. “You talk about changing things, but you don’t even know what that means. You can’t just destroy things, kill heroes, kidnap people.”

“I’m not exactly one for politics now, am I? All I’m good at is destroying stuff, and I didn’t even ask for that.”

“So, you don’t think destroying everything is a good idea?” Izuku asked, continuing the conversation. The more they could get out of Tomura, the better. 

“I don’t think so,” Tomura shrugged. “If I destroy everything, where would that leave me? I’d have nothing and nobody. My friends want to live in a world that’s easier for them, but all I can do is give them no world at all. But, I was also taught business. I was taught to…control my rage. In business, you cut the fat from the meat of your operation. What that entails, I don’t know right now. But, I think I know where to start.”

“...Where’s that?”

“Right here,” Tomura smiled, pinking tapping against Katsuki’s throat. “...I can kill him for you, if you want?”

“I-...Wh-What?” Izuku shared a glance with Kyouka, both tensing their muscles, preparing for anything. “You said you’d let him go.”

“I will, if you want that. But, hear me out. Think about it. Look at him, remember all he’s done. If he dies, who’s gonna blame you? Nobody even knows that you’re here. They’ll rightly blame me and move on. He dies, you’re free from him, and the world doesn’t have to endure having this piece of shit as a hero. I don't really see the problem here, but preventing the loss of life is kind of a part of your job, so I get it.”

“All this was to convince me to let you kill him?”

“No. Never lied, don’t intend to. In fact, you’re oddly one of the few people I think honesty is the best approach to. I…You know what? I haven’t given you anything to believe that you can trust me. How about this then…Call All Might. He’s not at the bar. He’s at a big warehouse, northeast of the Kamino shopping district. It’s where the Nomu are made.”

The couple’s eyes widened, shocked at Tomura’s nonchalant willingness to give away such information. Izuku glanced down at Kyouka’s jacks, not seeing any movement whatsoever. 

He wasn’t lying…

“...Why would you tell us this?”

“Because, I told you, I already know who I’m betting on. It was always a part of the plan that I lead in his stead, anyway.”

“Wait, wait, yo-...You’re betting on All Might to win?”

“Be shocked if he didn’t.” Tomura chuckled, looking out across the buildings and homes towards the city. “My master isn’t exactly looking too good from when they fought last. Besides, it was always the plan that I begin to make my own moves without him. I think now's a good time to be let off the leash for a while. I’ve got some ideas that I’d rather not have to get corporate approval for. So, go ahead…Do it. It’s not a trap. Even if it was, there’s not much my master can do. They’re both expecting to fight tonight, and I can only assume neither of them wanted it so soon.”

Izuku had no clue what to expect out of this, or if it was a good idea. 

…It probably wasn’t.

But, he pulled out his phone anyway.

  
  
  
  

***…~AIV~...***

  
  
  

**(** **Kamino Ward: Outside of League of Villains Dive Bar** **)**

  
  
  

**“Any movement in or out?”**

  
  

Tsukauchi sighed, shaking his head as he peered through the blinds of the window in the unowned, empty apartment they were occupying across the street. “Don’t think so. Mt. Lady is almost in position on the other side of the building next door. Bakugou’s tracker is still active, and if we’re right, she should be able to grow, reach right into the building, and grab him.”

Toshinori leaned against the wall next to the window, Izuku’s words still echoing in his mind. Whatever the signal was reading, it wasn’t Bakugou. 

If Young Midoriya was telling the truth, and he most assuredly was, then where the Hell was he?

If it *was* a trap, he wasn’t too worried. He sat in the apartment with Endeavor, Edgeshot, Best Jeanist, Kamui Woods, and Torino. Not to mention Mt. Lady on undercover recon outside. Not to mention the dozens and dozens of SWAT teams on stand-by. It was one Hell of a line-up. 

But, if tonight ended like he thought, then they wouldn’t be enough. It would be up to him. 

“I still question why so many of us were needed.” Toshinori did his best not to roll his eyes as Endeavor grunted from his position by the front door. “Many of the top ten are here for one rescue. The others could be relocated to other issues while we handle this.”

**“Aw, you wanna team up, just you and me?”**

Edgeshot quickly stepped in, speaking up from his meditation spot in the center of the floor, “We all saw what happened in Hosu, and you two were there personally. Not to mention the beast All Might fought at UA earlier in the year. There’s no telling what the League has up their sleeve. Our safest bet is to have all of our best assets on hand.”

“Yet,” Jeanist cut in, a small wolf being knitted together in his hands, “I only see four of the Top Five. Where is Hawks?”

Tsukauchi shook his head, downing the last of his coffee on the windowsill, “Out of town on some important investigation. He couldn’t make it on such short notice.”

*~”A phone call is here! A phone call is here! A phone call is here!”~*

Toshinori pulled out his phone, ignoring the facepalming Torino on the side, and saw Izuku’s contact on his screen. **“I’ve gotta take this.”**

Tsukauchi nodded towards the side hallway, “Bedroom is empty. We move in ten minutes.”

**“Got it.”** Toshinori walked through the hallway into the back bedroom with some surveillance gear strewn about the place. He shut the door and deflated as he answered the call, figuring he’d buy himself every second of his heroic appearance that he could. “Young Midoriya? What’s wrong?”

*“No time to explain. A big, abandoned warehouse northeast of the shopping district. It’s where they make the Nomu…He’s there.”*

**“I…You’re not there, are you?”**

*“No, we’re not. Not even close, don’t worry. We’re not in danger, I promise. We’ll take care of Kacchan, the other heroes can handle the League. Don’t worry about anything else.”*

He knew it was best not to ask questions. Whatever they were doing, interference would muck things up. He had to trust his young wards. He did with his life, so he would with Young Bakugou’s. 

“Okay. I’ll see you both when this is over.” He hung up, sighing as he left the room, his heart pulsing in his ears as he buffed himself up again. He pocketed his phone, looking around at his colleagues as he tried to come up with some sort of excuse. There really wasn’t one, but he’d deal with the fallout later. **“I need to go.”**

Everyone turned to him, all utterly confused at the concept alone. Edgeshot got up, a brow raised, “Uh…I’m sorry, but what?”

**“It’s important. Beyond important. It’s an anonymous tip for where the leader of the League may be…** ***is*** **hiding. I have to take this.”** He turned to Tsukauchi, one of the two other people who actually understood what was going on. **“...I** ***need*** **to go.”**

Tsukauchi took a deep breath, nodding his head, “Go. We’ve got this covered.”

“The Hell is going on here?” Endeavor growled as he marched up to All Might. “This is-”

**“An important situation that you think needs less heroes, right? There, you got your wish. Have fun! Torino, you coming?”** Torino hummed in response as he pushed past Endeavor, exiting the apartment and moving through the dimly lit hallway. Toshinori walked over to Tsukauchi, a hand out to shake. **“Good luck, Detective.”**

“You too,” Tsukauchi returned the handshake in kind, hoping this wasn’t the last time he spoke to his friend.

Toshinori leaned in, whispering quietly, *“Call the nearest station in Kamino, and every hero agency nearby that can move quickly on short notice. Evacuate Kamino, the entire ward. Hell, probably further. Get people as far away from there as possible.”*

*“That’s thousands upon thousands of people. It’ll cause panic.”*

*“As long as they’re running away from Kamino, we’ll have to deal with it. Tsukauchi, I’ll do everything I possibly can, but I don’t think casualties can be avoided here. Not with him. We have to reduce it as much as we can.”*

*“...I’ll get on it.”*

*“Thank you, and…Goodbye, my friend.”*  

Toshinori took his leave, meeting Torino in the hallway. Once they were a decent distance from the door, Torino asked, “He called you?”

**“No, Young Midoriya did.”**

“I…Excuse me?”

**“He won’t tell me what they’re doing, or how they’re getting all this information, but he and Young Jirou are up to something. Not only do they apparently know All For One’s location, but they know that Bakugou isn’t in the bar. The tracker was compromised a while ago. He said to leave Bakugou’s rescue to them.”**

“Wh-?! And you listened?! Are you all insane?!”

Toshinori reached the end of the hall, opening up the window leading to the fire escape, **“Anything we do might jeopardize their mission. It’s just like Endeavor said. We divide our efforts. They have their mission, we have ours, and I trust them to see it through. Now, when we get there, I go in first. No arguments. We both know how catastrophic this could be, so you need to call every contact you have in Kamino. Find cops on patrol, other heroes, whoever you can. Help in the evacuation. I’ll try to keep him distracted, talking. He loves to hear himself, trust me.”**

All Might jumped out of the window and into the night air, heading towards fate.

  
  
  
  

***…~AIV~...***

  
  

**(** **Aldera Rooftop** **)**

  
  

Izuku pocketed his phone, looking back up to Tomura, “There. Now what?”

“Well, that depends on you. You *really* sure you don’t want me to kill him?”

“Yes!” Izuku responded firmly. 

“Alright, alright. Fine, I get it. You can have him…after.”

Izuku sighed, knowing there would be a catch, “After what?”

Tomura smiled, pulling out his own phone and sending a quick text. A vortex swirled open behind him as he beckoned them forth, slowly backing into it with Katsuki, “After we watch the fireworks.”

“Wai-!” But, it was too late, he disappeared into the portal. The darkness remained in the air, calling to the couple to follow. “...Was he lying?”

Kyouka groaned, readying herself, “No, but did we really have a choice, even if he was?”

Izuku furrowed his brow, running to the portal with Kyouka by his side, “No.”

They ran into the portal, both it and them disappearing from the rooftop, both prepared and unprepared for the grand finale.

  
  
  

***…~AIV~...***

  
  
  

**(** **Kamino Ward: Abandoned Warehouse** **)**

  
  

Yep, this certainly was the place. 

Tubes and wires ran everywhere, all running to glowing green vats and tubs of Nomu lined-up. The green vats were the only light emanating throughout the place, as most windows had been boarded up. 

Most…

Toshinori had entered through a broken window in the shipping garage after making sure the evacuation had started. Every shop, restaurant, and vendor were being forced to close down for the night, leaving the civilians with no reason to stay. 

Hopefully by now, people were being ushered out of the district. The main problem would be the businesses and apartment buildings. There would assuredly be conflicts with people who didn’t want to leave or wanted to at least grab their stuff first. But, it was being conveyed as an absolute emergency, so hopefully some would see reason.

He followed the wires, all seemingly converging to one line running through the halls of the old office area. Thankfully, the Nomu seemed to be in some sort of coma or stasis. They wouldn’t be waking up, but it didn’t stop All Might from yanking out and crushing wires as he walked along.

At the end of the hallway was a set of double doors, the wires leading under them. Toshinori stopped at the door, taking a deep breath to calm his heart. 

*\*Knock-Knock-Knock\**

…

The doors suddenly slid open, piercing shriek echoing throughout the warehouse. Toshinori was met with wires and tubes cascaded across the room, blinking lights, the hiss of oxygen tanks, the beeping of a heart monitor, and the static of a TV.

The wires and tubes ran to the center of a room where what looked like a makeshift, scrapped together throne sat. The darkness shrouded the being who sat in the chair, only his outline being visible. 

“...Long time no see, All Might.” All For One lazily moved a finger, a table moving on its own and placed between him and All Might. Two chairs followed, and on the table sat a tea kettle and cups. “Forgive the repetition of our last meeting, but what can I say? Sentimentality and all that. Please, let us be seated, and have a chat before we begin business.”

All Might walked in, sitting down at the table as All For One got up from his chair. He picked up what looked like some sort of neck brace or helmet, but he didn’t put it on. An oxygen mask was thrown to the wayside as All For One approached, finally emerging from the shadows.

Toshinori’s eyes widened at the sight before him. The man he fought seven years ago was gone, and all that remained was an utterly marred being. No eyes, nose, eyebrows, just scarred and mutilated skin molded to somewhat resemble a head. 

Toshinori wasn’t sure what he was expecting; his memory certainly didn’t fail him in terms of how All For One was beaten last time. He blew off All For One’s head, and this was ironically living proof of that. 

“Ah, you see? Just like last time,” All For One sat down and smiled, his mouth being the only remaining part of his old head, “...A little calm before the storm.”
