**(** **Three Weeks Later** **)**

  
  
  
  

Izuku felt all his muscles tense as euphoria burst through every inch of his body. He panted heavily, his heart rate slowing down from the excitement.

Kyouka lowered herself down, her lower half not able to support her anymore, nuzzling her face into Izuku's neck as she came down from her own orgasm. 

Izuku pulled out, sighing as he was released from Kyouka, kissing the side of her head. Her lips met his, both moaning in pleasure. Kyouka put her hands on Izuku's chest, raising herself up to look down at him.

God, she was beautiful. 

His hands caressed her face, running down all the way to Kyouka's hips. Every inch of her was angelic, not a single ounce of perfection was spared in her creation. 

Kyouka leaned back down, bumping her forehead against Izuku's. Izuku wrapped his arms around her, hugging her tight. "Do you want to go again?"

Kyouka chuckled, caressing his cheek, "Of course I want to. But, you've gotta wake up."

Izuku's expression immediately switched to annoyance.

 "Oh you've gotta be kidding m-!" Izuku jumped awake, sweat drenching his shirt and pillow. "Damn it!" 

Izuku groaned, hitting his head against his pillow. Well, it was an amazing dream while it lasted. He turned to look at his clock, seeing that it was barely past dawn. Well, today was an important day. No time to waste.

…He just had to change his clothes.

...And his sheets.

**(** **A Few Hours Later: Kyouka’s Bedroom** **)**

  
  

Kyouka grumbled at the sound of her door creeping open with footsteps approaching her bed.

She buried her face further into her pillow, her voice coming out muffled, “You could be a little quieter, you know?”

She heard Izuku chuckle, placing his hand on her hip and pressing a kiss to the back of her neck, “I don’t think it would help. You probably heard me coming up the stairs.”

Kyouka grabbed his hand, draping his arm over her body, “Front door, actually.”

Izuku followed her lead and laid down, pulling Kyouka to his chest and burying his face into her hair, “Happy Birthday, Kyouka.”

“Thank you,” Kyouka smiled, bringing Izuku’s hand up to kiss his knuckles. “This probably wasn’t what my parents had in mind when you said you were going to come wake me up.”

“If it wasn’t what they had in mind, then it should at least be what they expected me to do instead.”

“True enough. So, is it my turn for a surprise party?”

“As if we’d be able to sneak anybody in here without you hearing them. Imagine trying to keep Mei quiet. Taking her to that movie last week was a nightmare.”

“Hmhmhm, I thought Tenya was gonna have an aneurysm. So, what do you have planned for me then?”

“I said I didn’t have a surprise *party* . Never said I didn’t have a few surprises up my sleeve. You gave me the best birthday of my life last month, so I’ve got a big act to follow.”

“Do these surprises require me to be up right this instant?”

Izuku smiled, kissing her shoulder, “Maybe five more minutes.”

“Ten,” Kyouka bargained.

“I don’t know. Your parents may get suspicious if I’m up here with you for another ten whole minutes.”

“They have a right to, because who said I wanted to spend the next ten minutes sleeping?”

“...” Izuku propped himself up on his elbow, allowing Kyouka to roll onto her back to smirk up at him. “...You’re one hell of a businesswoman. Ten minutes it is.”

Kyouka smiled as Izuku’s lips connected with her’s, feeling his arms snake around her back. Her first birthday with a boyfriend was already a resounding success. It was hard to think that a year ago she would have just spent her birthday with her parents. She hadn’t been close enough to anybody to warrant an invitation, not that she particularly wanted to make a big deal out of it anyway.

But, Izuku clearly wouldn’t take that sitting down.

As far as he was concerned, the day she was born should be considered an international holiday. 

So, she was ready for him to be extra affectionate today. Which was difficult to imagine, since he showered her with love constantly. But, that shower was probably going to turn into a downpour with an accompanying flood warning.

A downpour that seemingly already started, as Izuku left her lips and trailed kisses down her neck and onto her collar bone, and his left hand moved from her back to rub the outside of her thigh. 

These had become two of his signs that meant he was asking for permission to go further. 

Over the weeks since his birthday night, they had continued to play with the borderline of their intimacy. They were seeing how far they could push it before actually crossing it. 

And, it had been, uh…

How could she put it?

Oh, right. Fucking awesome.

She gently took his wrist, giving it the smallest pull downward, allowing him to reach around to her backside. Being given the green light, Izuku used his other hand to hook a finger around the collar of Kyouka’s shirt, pull it down to expose the valley of her breasts, and continue his trail of kisses down. 

A moan escaped the back of her throat, and Kyouka quickly covered her own mouth, praying to every god from every religion that her mom didn’t hear that. 

Okay, maybe it was a little risky.

Her jacks reached down, reaching down Izuku’s back until they poked his butt. He raised his gaze up, a brow raised, “You’ve been very insistent on touching there lately.”

“You’re insistent on touching mine.”

“I-...Yeah, true.”

“But, this time I was trying to get your attention. As much as I want to keep getting frisky, my parents will only tolerate playing ignorant to what they probably think we’re doing for so long.”

“Okay. But, later?”

“Absolutely,” Kyouka pressed her jacks under Izuku’s chin, guiding him back to her lips. “I’d say my birthday is a good reason to treat myself.”

“If by treating yourself, you mean do what we do most days, then yes, I’d say it’s a good reason. But, I guess if you’re looking for a little more…” Izuku hopped up from the bed, quickly picking up Kyouka bridal-style and headed for the door. 

“Hey!” Kyouka laughed in faux protest. “What if I hadn't been wearing shorts?”

“It would be very embarrassing for us both, but I wouldn’t exactly complain.”

Kyouka hid her face into his shoulder, her face beet red, “It took all of your willpower to get that out without stuttering and blushing.”

“Yep, but it was worth it.”

Izuku carried her out of her room and down the hallway until they reached the upper landing. From the living room, Mika looked up from the couch at the sound of footsteps, smiling at her daughter being carried down the stairs. 

“So, turning sixteen means you don’t need to use your feet anymore, huh?”

“Not my choice!” Kyouka quickly defended herself. 

“If he’s whipped enough to the point where he does this without needing to be asked, then you’re at least partially responsible.”

Izuku reached the bottom of the stairs, moving to the right, into the dining area and setting Kyouka down at the table. She turned around in her chair, looking at her mother back in the living room, “Then you’re partially responsible, because I got it from you.”

“You know it,” Mika got up from the couch, moving into the dining room and kissing Kyouka’s temple, hugging her tightly. “Happy Birthday, Kyouka. You’re the best song I’ve ever made.”

“Excuse me,” Kyoutoku interrupted, walking through the kitchen door with a tray of food in hand. “But I was a part of that song’s creation, too.”

“Ugh! Gross! No!” Kyouka gagged out. “The song analogy is officially ruined for me. And, Izuku is *right here!”*

Izuku took his seat next to Kyouka, shaking his head, “I’ve already blocked it out entirely.”

“Anyway,” Kyoutoku moved on, setting down a tray containing a plate of omurice and a bowl of porridge in front of Kyouka. “I present breakfast, cooked by yours truly, for his favorite child.”

“I’m your only child.”  
  

“Doesn’t change the sentiment. But, that’s not all. I’ve picked up a little trick!” Kyoutoku said excitedly, whipping out a knife.

Kyouka’s brows rose at the sight of the blade, “Oh boy…”

“I’ve watched multiple different Youtube videos on how to do this, and I can officially say I am a master. And, now, with a single slice of my knife, I will serve you the perfect omurice.” Kyoutoku sliced the pillowly eggs, releasing *somehow* still raw egg whites onto the rice underneath. Kyoutoku stared down at his dish, completely baffled, as his daughter laughed her ass off.  “Oh what the hell?! How?! I-! You know what? Screw this.”

Kyoutoku turned back around, walking through the side door into the kitchen, returning with the toaster. He adjusted a dial on the laser, aiming it at Kyouka’s plate, and zapping her eggs until they fried into a fluffy, pastel yellow. 

Mika shook her head as her husband smirked proudly, “I really should take that away from you, but it makes you so happy.”

Kyoutoku nodded, patting the toaster, “That it does. Tell your friend Hatsume that I want to invest in her business once she graduates.”

“That…” Izuku hummed to himself, nodding his head, “...is actually probably a very good idea, business-wise.”

“As long as you have coverage for property damage,” Kyouka added in between bites.

Knitting his brows together, Kyoutoku gazed back and forth between the two teens, “Property Damage? Why?”

Izuku and Kyouka looked at each other before turning back to him, “No reason.” / “No reason.”

Kyoutoku frowned on confusion but before he could question them further, Mika grabbed her daughter by the shoulders, “Before this turns into a whole thing, let's go get you dolled up. You can eat while you get ready.”

Kyouka furrowed her brow, picking up her plate as she got up, “Get ready for what?”

“You’ll see. Now, c’mon, I have to make sure my Birthday Girl is looking her best.”

Kyouka raised a brow, watching Izuku’s eyes shift to the side at Mika’s comment. She smirked at him, her jack reaching under Izuku’s chin and directed his eyes back to her. “It took everything in your power not to say I always look my best, didn’t it?”

“...I mean it was right there.”

Kyoutoku drooped his head with a groan, “Kid, you are so god-damn cheesy. How does it somehow work on my own daughter?”

Kyouka shrugged as her mom began to lead her up the steps, “A girl wants what a girl wants.”

Izuku smiled as he watched her go, turning back to Kyoutoku, keeping his voice as low as possible, “Is everything ready?”

“Should be, kid,” Kyoutoku reassured him. “You know, a bit of advice: You might wanna save more big gestures like this for the future. You don’t wanna run out of ideas too soon.”

“Counter Argument,” Izuku pointed back, “I want to get all of these big ideas out of the way now, because odds are after years of being heroes, we’ll want more and more simple and quiet celebrations instead. Besides, Kyouka and I both aren’t ones for big celebrations anyway, but we don’t know what the future holds. If this is my only chance, I’m taking it.”

“Hm, fair enough.”  

“Besides, she gave me the best birthday I’ve ever had. It’s not a competition, but I have to reciprocate my appreciation.”

Kyoutoku peered at him confused, “All she did was invite your friends over.”

Izuku smiled, getting up from his chair, “Exactly. I’m gonna wait outside and call said friends, just to make sure nothing has fallen apart down there. Which, with my luck, is definitely a possibility.”

Izuku took his leave, a still confused Kyoutoku in his wake.

**(** **Kyouka’s Bedroom** **)**

  
  

“You excited?” Mika asked from her daughter’s closet.

“As excited as I can be for something that I don’t even know what it is,” Kyouka grinned, applying lipstick as her jacks applied eyeliner. “But, I think Izuku could take me to a landfill, and I’d just be happy he was there.”

“All I’ll say is this,” Mika said, walking back into Kyouka’s room with a selected outfit for her daughter in hand. “Izuku pulled out all the stops. Sometimes I can’t believe you got this lucky on your first try of finding a boyfriend.”

Kyouka brushed her hair as her jacks tussled it up in the right places, “I never went looking. He just sort of popped up.”

“Which is exactly what I mean,” Mika chuckled, bringing a dress over to her daughter. She carefully brought the dress around her daughter, holding it to her front and examining it in the mirror. “I’m thinking this one.”

Kyouka looked down at the dress and nodded, “He’ll love it.”

“Of course he will,” Mika rolled her eyes. “If you haven’t noticed, he rightfully finds you incredibly attractive. He’ll like anything we put you in. How do *you* like it? I don’t think I’ve ever actually seen you wear this since we bought it.”

Kyouka’s gaze returned to the mirror, tentatively using her hands to press the dress against her body. The concentration she gave to analyzing every inch of her body was sending off red flags to every corner of her brain, telling her to stop, to not make things worse.

But, even if she couldn’t say it with as much conviction as she would like, Kyouka smiled a little and finally replied.

“...I love it.”

“Perfect.” Mika kissed her cheek, moving back to the bed to assemble the outfit. 

Kyouka breathed a sigh of relief, glad that her mother’s eyes were no longer on her. Someday she would have to tell both her and her father about that dark side of her mind. But, not today. She had bigger things to worry about.

Especially since the dark side of her mind continued to grow as it fed on her anxiety and fears of her loved one, and subsequently her loved ones, dying to a madman in an inevitable battle she felt helpless in. 

But, Kyouka cut the head off of those thoughts right then and there.

It was her birthday. No more negative thoughts.

Sixteen years of life on this planet.

She was in love, had friends and family she loved, was attending her dream school, part of a Hero Duo (in training), an ace student, trained under the Number One Hero, fought the Hero Killer and (barely) won, fought All Might and barely won (survived).

Mom was right. She was pretty damn lucky. 

  
  
  

***…~AIV~...***

  
  
  

**(** **Thirty-Minutes Later** **)**

  
  

“We’ve got all of the fire extinguishers on hand, right?”

*“We’ve got four, and we made Mei bring her own,”* Momo responded from the other end of the call.

“...Didn’t we have five?”

  *“...She may or may not have lit one of the bathroom sinks on fire.”*

Izuku took the phone away from his ear, slumping forward from his position on the front steps. He sighed, leaning back against the railing, “Tell Shoto he’s on Mei Guard Duty.”

*“Already on it. He’s keeping an eye on her, and I created a Rubik's Cube to keep her distracted. So, I’d say we’ve got about an hour before she turns it into a weapon of mass destruction.”*

“Good, we should be there by then. Thanks, Momo.”

Izuku ended the call, running a hand through his hair as he gazed out onto the street. This was why he was grateful that Tenya and Momo got the Class President and Vice President roles over him. Planning definitely wasn’t his forte. 

…Which explained a lot about his fighting-style, now that he thought about it.

“Alright, let’s see what over-the-top gesture you’ve pulled out of your noggin this time.”

Izuku turned around to see Kyouka walk out of her front door, his eyes nearly popping out of his head at the sight before him. 

![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/F37KyJIXEAAANAt?format=jpg&name=large)

Kyouka stood in a black, halter neck dress with three straps draped on each arm. Near the end of the dress was a sheet music design sewn into the fabric. There was an oversized red leather jacket falling from her shoulders, bundling at her elbows. As Izuku’s eyes shamelessly traveled down, he found her torn fishnets and lace-up combat heels.

Izuku felt a jack press under his chin, lifting his gaze up to Kyouka. 

“I’ve got eyes, you know?” Kyouka felt her cheeks warm, hugging the jacket to her body, “Insert cheesy sincere line here.”

“How do you become more beautiful every time I see you?”

Kyouka stepped down to the step that made her at equal height to Izuku, kissing him softly, “There it is.”

Izuku smiled back, noticing Kyouka’s black lipstick. He wiped at his lips, checking for any residue, “Is that lipstick smudge-proof? When you wore lipstick the night after the festival, my mom saw it on my face.”

“It is, but if it wasn’t, would it have stopped you?”

“Not a chance.”

“Oh *brother* ,” The teens heard Kyoutoku groan from behind them as he exited his house, taking his car keys out of his pocket. “Who the hell writes your dialogue?”

“We write ourselves, Old Man,” Kyouka scoffed back at her father, her jacks wrapping around Izuku’s arm. “Besides, you’re the one who taught me lyricism, so what’s that say about you?”

"That I'm a far better composer than a teacher," Kyoutoku grumbled back, heading towards the garage door.

Izuku raised a brow as he watched him walk away, "He seems…particularly fussy."

“Don’t worry about it," Kyouka shrugged. “Dad’s never been a particular fan of my birthday, because he doesn’t like coming to grips with me growing up.”

*"I may not have your super-hearing, but I can still hear you!"* Kyoutoku’s voice echoed from the garage.

“I hope you can!” Kyouka yelled back. “Just means we’re further away from getting you hearing aids!”

Izuku chuckled as he heard Kyoutoku grumble in the garage, putting his arm around Kyouka’s waist, “He’s really not that old.”

Kyouka shrugged, leaning into him, “Yeah, but we’re the youth of the world. Anyone past thirty is old.”

“So, your mom is old?”

“Pfft, I’m not gonna say that.  Do I look like I wanna die? Alright, enough gawking. At least stop gawking in a way that my parents will notice. Now, wh-...What the hell?!”

“Wh-What?! What’s wrong?!”

“Where are they?!” Kyouka pointed down at Izuku’s feet in absolute disbelief. Replacing his usual red shoes were casual black lace-up boots. "I have quite literally *never* seen you wear different shoes."

“They didn’t go with the outfit!” Izuku cried out, gesturing down to his dark green button-up and black pants. “I already genetically look like a Christmas tree! The red shoes didn’t help this time.”

Kyouka threw her head back in a laugh, “Well, I guess fashion sense can go on the list of things you’ve learned from me. I miss the shoes, though.”

Izuku took her hand, kissing her knuckles before walking her to the garage to join her father, “They’ll be back, I promise. Now, are you ready for your ‘surprise’ party?”

Kyouka hugged his arm to her chest, “Take me away, Pretty Boy.”

  
  
  
  
  

***…~AIV~...***

  
  

**(** **Thirty Minutes later** **)**

  
  
  

“Oh my…Izuku, really?” Kyouka turned to her boyfriend with a smirk, the “Ryuji Twilight Jazz Club” standing before her once again. “Here again?”

Shutting the car door, and shrugged, “I had to. Where else would I choose?”

“He insisted on taking us here,” Kyoutoku shook his head, looking up at the neon blue sign. “No idea why, but he’s apparently the expert here, so I didn’t ask.”

“This was our first date spot,” Kyouka informed him.

“...You took my daughter to a freeform jazz club for your first date? You know her, right?”

Mika nudged her husband, “Taking her to a place where she can musically judge people?”

“...Oooooh.” Kyoutoku turned to Izuku with admiration in his eyes, “You *are* an expert.”

Izuku chuckled, leading them inside, “Unfortunately, neither Quirk Studies or Kyouka Studies are available at UA. If they were, we’d get that grant in a heartbeat.”

Once inside the club, Kyouka looked around questioningly, not noticing any staff like the first time they were there. “You guys bought this place out for the day?”

“For a few hours,” Izuku corrected her. “They’re typically open in the evenings, so we’ve got time to stay and then get everything back in order.”

“All for little ol’ me, huh? What exactly have you done, Beansprout?”

“Oh, the nicknames are back?”

“It’s a special day,” Kyouka giggled.

“A special day for a special woman,” Izuku agreed, gesturing towards the door that led to the main area. “If you want to know so bad, then look inside.”

Kyouka peered at Izuku before rolling her eyes at the theatrics. She walked up to the door, opening it up to peek inside. They all heard her quietly gasp, her body immediately becoming tense. Kyouka quickly shut the door, staring into space with wide eyes. She took a peek inside once more, only to shut the door again and stare in silence.

Eventually, she turned around, unblinking eyes directed at her boyfriend, “...Izuku?”

“Yeah?” Izuku chuckled.

“...Is that Deep Dope on stage?”

“...Yeah.”

“Mm, I see.” Kyouka turned to her parents, her shocked expression never changing. “Did you guys…?”

Kyoutoku nodded his head back over to Izuku, “All his idea, came to us with it. Helped organize it and everything.”

Mika smiled and continued for her husband, “We’re just lucky their manager owed us a few favors, and we were happy to cash out.”

Kyouka turned to her boyfriend, still in disbelief that this was happening. Izuku merely rubbed the back of his head with a blush, a bright, wide, innocent smile on his face.

…Yep, that was it.

He was so getting laid tonight.

She stepped up to Izuku, cupped his cheeks, and brought him down to look him dead in the eye, “I. Love. You. *So. Much.”*

Kyoutoku quickly tried to interject, “Ah, well, I mean your mom and I still also helped set it up. Our connections and all-” 

“More than *anybody* ,” Kyouka continued, as if she hadn’t heard her father.  
  

“Anybody? Bit of a jump, don’t you thi-?”

“Mmmmwah!” Kyouka hugged Izuku tightly, planting a big kiss on his lips.

Kyoutoku’s head drooped, with Mika rubbing his back and chuckling, “I’m just gonna…stand over there. Oomph!”

Kyoutoku and Mika were nearly tackled over in a hug by their daughter, her jacks wrapping around both of them, “Thank you both so much. I also love you more than anybody.”

Kyoutoku feigned a sigh, putting his arms around his daughter, “Ah, I’ll take it…But, if you had to choose-”

Mika elbowed his ribs, hugging her daughter back, “We love you, too.”

Kyouka pulled back, looking up at her parents, “How’d you guys even book them? For a private show, no less.”

“I pulled every single string I had, but even then I needed to pay a pretty penny to get this to happen. Fortunately, Izuku knew a more than willing benefactor to front the bill. And, uh, you were spot on about him being a private man, Izuku,” Kyoutoku chuckled, pointing over to one of the staff rooms.

The couple turned to see Toshinori peeking out from behind the door, giving a little wave before shutting it.

“Wh-?! Wait a minute.” Kyouka rushed to the door with Izuku in tow. They quickly entered, finding Toshinori sitting down at what seemed to be the manager’s desk.

“...What’s up?” Toshi waved.

Kyouka scoffed, “You look like a psycho just peeking out from the door like that at a teenage girl’s birthday party.” 

“What am I supposed to do?” Toshinori threw his hands up, “What happens when one of your friends sees me out there, and then they accidentally come across me not in my hero form at school? Try explaining why you personally know All Might so well.”

“Then why’d you even come? Not that I don’t appreciate it,” Kyouka raised a brow at him.

“Because as it turns out, like reasonable people, Deep Dope doesn’t want to come to some girl’s birthday party whilst taking mystery money from a mystery man...I also wanna be a supportive mentor and have birthday cake.”

Kyouka couldn’t help but laugh, marching over to All Might and throwing her arms around him, “Thank you so much. I’m sorry it cost a lot.”

“Bah, hiring a band for a private show? Chump change,” Toshinori patted her back, waving off the concern. “That’s three hugs now, by the way. But, who’s keeping track?”

Kyouka backed away with a roll of her eyes, but suddenly looked back with worry, “Wait, isn’t it also bad that Deep Dope’s manager saw you? What if your secret comes out someday?”

“Ah, I had that covered,” Toshinori waved it off dismissively.

Kyouka squinted at him, not convinced in the slightest, “Oh yeah? How so?”

“...” All Might very slowly reached into his jacket pocket, pulling out a fake black mustache and raising it to his lips.

Kyouka facepalmed as Izuku died of laughter on the other side of the desk, “It doesn’t even match your hair color!”

“Hey, it worked!”

“Because they don’t even know who you are!”

Izuku’s laughter mostly subsided, turning back to his mentor, “First the purple wig, and now this. Where do you get this stuff?”

Kyouka knit her brows together, turning to her boyfriend, “Purple wig? What did you need that for?”

“No reason.” / “He was practicing asking you to be his girlfr-I mean, no reason.” Izuku and Toshinori respectively replied in a panic.

“...You know what? Nevermind. I swear, sometimes you two share the same brain cell.”

“Hey, that’s what the other teachers and I think about you two,” Toshinori swatted back.

“Hysterical,” Kyouka deadpanned at him, “We’ll bring you cake, I promise. We won’t leave you alone in here for hours.”

“Bah, don’t worry about me. Go on, get out of here. Have fun.”

“You got it!” Kyouka grabbed Izuku’s hand, rushing out of the office, past her parents, and into the main dining hall. It was just as Izuku remembered it. Dark wood paneling, large, rounded booths made with maroon leather, and dim lights above each table varied in their colors, with the main light in the room coming from the stage at the front. 

AKA: Kyouka’s Target.

Their friend group, along with Inko, turned to see her charge through the door. Caught off guard, they all jumped up and shouted, “HAPPY BIR-”

But, Kyouka pushed right through them, knocking both Ochako and Iida over in the process, shoving chairs out of the way, careening around the cloth covered tables, and sped right up to the stage. The second they reached the stage, Kyouka suddenly froze on the spot, standing rigid and unblinking as the four band members gazed down at her confusedly. 

“Uh…” The man with long shaggy hair in front started, shifting his eyes nervously as Kyouka continued to stare silently. “...Happy Birthday?”

“H-Hi…” Kyouka barely got out, seemingly not even hearing what he had said. “Y-You guys are my favorite band, l-like…ever.”

Izuku stood next to her in stunned silence, not even sure what to make of this. Did she just turn into him from a year ago?

“Nice,” The drummer in the back responded. “We’ve heard your parents’ tracks, and they were killing it. They said you were a musician, too.”

“Hehehehehe, y-yeah, I am,” Kyouka blushed, rubbing her arm.

Izuku squinted at her, both not liking the looks she was giving them, and the churning in his stomach. So, this was what jealously felt like, huh?

…He didn’t like it.

“This is my boyfriend!” Kyouka pointed at Izuku, still not unlocking eyes with the band. “He’s the reason you guys are here, and I love him, and he’s perfect.”

Okay, nevermind, this was pretty awesome.

“Uh…Cool. Sup, man?”/ “How’s it goin’?” / “Hey.” / What’s up?”

Izuku awkwardly waved back, looking back at the rest of the party members as they spectated in amusement. Izuku cleared his throat, turning back to the band, “Uh, as you can see she’s a massive fan. But, u-uh, Kyouka, maybe we should turn around and thank everyone else who showed u-”

“Can I play with you guys?!” Kyouka suddenly blurted out, her jacks tapping together nervously. “I know all your songs by heart! All instruments!”

“Uh…” The man in front turned around, looking back at the rest of his band members as they all shrugged. “Sure, why not?”

“...Awesome.” Kyouka took a deep, shaky breath, turning to Izuku. “Have I mentioned that I love you?”

“A few times today.”

“Because I do. So much.”

“Get on stage, Kyouka.”

She smiled brightly, quickly kissing his cheek before running up on stage. Izuku turned back to his friends, not exactly sure what to do now. They had gone all out, but apparently his gift didn’t just overshadow other gifts, it overshadowed the entire party. 

“Well…Enjoy the party?”

His friends all looked around at each other before finally shrugging, walking towards the open area in front of the stage as the band was about to start.

Izuku sighed, walking over to the front row of tables, sitting down next to his mother, and the Jirous who had just walked in. He looked over to Inko, a small smile on his lips as Kyouka and the band began to play. “I think it’s safe to say I did good?”

Inko chuckled, kissing his forehead, “Perfectly.”

  
  
  
  

***…~AIV~...***

  
  
  
  

**(** **Many Hours Later** **)**

  
  

Eventually, Deep Dope’s scheduled time was up, and the party slowly began to die down after that.  

She had apologized profusely to her friends for ignoring them at first, she was just too excited. Eventually, she got down from the stage and danced with them as an apology

And, watching their friends try to dance to punk music had been quite the sight. 

Kyouka got to teach Ochako and Momo about headbanging, which ended with…results.

Ochako had gotten a little too enthusiastic, shaking her head wildly until she had to sit down…after about an hour of doing it. She might or might not have gotten a slight concussion, causing Momo to eventually take their leave to get her checked out.

Speaking of Momo, clearly punk music wasn’t exactly her thing. Kyouka was convinced she had never heard anything outside of classical music in her entire life. She was a little awkward with it at first, but after a while, it seemed her ‘inner rocker’ came out.

She was eventually headbanging so hard her hair fell right out of its ponytail and flailed around wildly. 

Mei headbanged the entire time, never pausing once, and turned out just fine. Kyouka decided to just not question it. 

Shoto did not dance. When asked to dance, he merely stared blankly.

Yeah, that was about right.

Iida certainly danced…pretty much exactly like they expected him to. He was essentially the Tin Man if Dorothy never re-oiled him.

Apparently, the rest of their class was going to the mall in a couple days to prepare for summer camp, and everyone was invited along. Part of Kyouka was sad, knowing that their vacation was about to technically end in a week’s time, but she agreed to come along anyway. Besides, it’d probably be fun.

Now, they sat in the front office again, fulfilling the promise they made at the beginning of the party.

“Wait, wait, wait…” Kyouka crossed her legs, swallowing the bite of cake she had. “Midnight used to run around *naked?”*

“Mm,” All Might shook his head, setting his fork down. “Not completely, but…more or less. She’s actually what started the most recent ruling of costume standards. They called it the ‘Midnight Mandate.’ Just don’t look it up.”

Kyouka frowned, turning to Izuku in the chair next to her, “...You’ve seen it, haven’t you, Hero Historian?”  
  

Izuku shifted his eyes to the side, tugging at the collar of his shirt, “No comment.”

Kyouka lightly pushed him as All Might chuckled. She shook her head, looking back at her teacher, “I’d ask how she can stand running around in that stuff…or lack thereof. But, I guess she makes it pretty obvious.”

"Eh, Nemuri's shtick gives her a false representation,” All Might countered, forking another piece of his cake. “It's mostly just to cash in on the whole ‘Sex Sells’ thing, but she definitely gets a kick out of it. She's actually extremely picky when it comes to romance. I don't think she's ever settled with the small number of people she's accepted. She's almost a completely different person on dates."

Kyouka furrowed her brow, looking up from across the table, "...How do you know that?"

Toshinori froze, food inches from his mouth. Izuku tried to hold in his laughter, fully aware of what he was referring to.

 "Uh…It's just word of mouth. Ya know, just some water cooler talk with the other teache-Okay, it was just one date."

"Oh. My. GOD!" Kyouka's jaw dropped, a mix of shock, confusion, and horror on her face.

…And Izuku was dying of laughter next to her.

"What?!" Toshinori tried defending himself, "It's not a big deal!"

"You're like twenty years older than her, DeCaprio!"

"Hey, *she* asked me out, okay?! I didn't approach her. It was just one date, like six years ago! I was trying to get my mind off of Kaina. And, I mean…C'mon…"

Kyouka peered at him, clearly not understanding what he was insinuating, "What?"

"I mean…we've all seen her. What? Am I supposed to say no?"

"Oh my God," Kyouka covered her eyes, pretending to gag as Izuku did his best to stifle his laughter. With Kyouka's eyes closed, Izuku took the opportunity to fistbump All Might from across the table. "We didn't need to know this! Holy shit, why did you curse me with this knowledge?!"

“To be fair to All Might,” Izuku interjected, his laughter finally disappearing, “he ran out on the date, anyway.”

Both All Might and Kyouka quickly shot up, “You knew?!” / “You knew?!”

“I saw it in the memories,” Izuku shrugged. “It seemed pretty personal. I didn’t think I needed to share it.”

“Okay, hold it!” All Might leaned across the table, squinting at his successor. “Exactly what else have you seen?”

“...Do you remember Dexter’s Dive Bar?”

Toshinori slammed his fist down on the table, pointing directly at Izuku’s eye, “Nana! Stop showing him this stuff! He doesn’t need to know any of this! How was it at all helpful?!”

“Th-That’s not how contacting her works!”

*~“Pfft, as far as you know.”~* Izuku heard echo distantly in his brain.

*‘Wh-?! Nana?! Nana, how’d you do that?!’* He waited for a response, scoffing as he was met with silence. “She has no comment.”

“Ugh,” Toshinori slumped back into his chair, running a hand down his face. “Please, for the love of all that’s holy, no more past surfing.”

“I only promise to try. Nana is persistent…Also, you know now that I basically have no choice but to tell Kyouka everything, right?”

“He’s not wrong,” Kyouka nodded. 

“Whatever, just keep my embarrassment between you two. Do. *NOT.* Tell. Torino.” Toshinori’s phone suddenly buzzed in his pocket, leaving him to continue to eye his smirking students suspiciously as he pulled out his phone, checking the notification. “Ah, I’ve got to run. Board meeting.”

“Board meeting?” Kyouka raised a brow at Toshinori as he stood up. “It’s summer.”  
  

“It’s just a quick meeting about your camp arrangements and some next semester planning. You know, boring adulting garbage.”  
  

“Ugh, something I’m one year closer to.”

“Exactly,” Toshinori chuckled. “Enjoy it while it lasts. Happy Birthday, Young Jirou. I thought I was lucky enough to have the privilege of watching Young Midoriya grow into one of the greatest heroes. But, to have you come along and give me the same opportunity with you is a gratitude I can never express fully how grateful I am for. Young Midoriya wouldn’t trade you for anything, and neither would I.”

Kyouka smiled, getting up to hug All Might again, “Thank you. For that, and for everything else you’ve done for me.”

“Anytime,” Toshinori patted her head, releasing himself from the hug. “...That’s four, by the way.”

“Shut up.”

He chuckled, moving around the desk to ruffle Izuku’s hair, “I’d say don’t lose this one, she’s special. But, you know that more than anyone. I’ll see you both later. Call if you need anything, alright?”  
  

They bid their goodbyes to him as he used the back exit, as if he was never at the party at all. 

Izuku stood up, putting an arm around Kyouka’s waist, “Did you enj-?”

He was cut off by Kyouka’s lips slamming into his, her jacks wrapping around his torso “Are you freaking kidding me? Izuku, you didn’t just give me the best birthday I’ve ever had, but you gave me what was equivalent to you meeting All Might for the first time. I mean, holy shit!”

“Well, you’re welcome,” Izuku rubbed the back of his neck with a blush. “Unfortunately, I’m all out of ideas now.”

Kyouka hummed to herself, an idea coming to her head. The day wasn’t over yet. “The beach, then. I don’t think there’s anywhere else I’d end today at.”

Izuku grinned, paying back her kiss with one of his own, “Let’s go then.”

They ran out of the office, running to the main room to find their parents, all talking at one of the tables. “Mom, Dad! We’re going to the beach! Love you!”

“You kids and that damn beach,” Kyoutoku rolled his eyes.

“It’s special, Old Man!” Kyouka yelled over her shoulder as they ran for the entrance.

“I’ll be home later, Mom!” Izuku shouted, already halfway out the door.

  
  
  
  
  

***…~AIV~...***

  
  
  
  

**(** **Half-An-Hour Later: Dagobah Municipal Beach Park** **)**

  
  
  

They had laid out the blankets they kept in the lockers by the stairs, laying down and staring up at the stars as soft waves crashed in the distance. They hadn’t said much once they got to the beach, merely enjoying each other’s presence.

Kyouka nuzzled into Izuku’s collarbone, closing her eyes as she honed her jacks in to listen to the ocean. She kissed Izuku’s neck, hugging him tighter, “I know I keep saying it, but thank you for today.”

“It’s not a problem, but it was a group effort.”

“That you started.”

“...Okay, you got me there.”

Kyouka giggled, rolling off of him to look up at the sky. Her mind wandered back to the morning, her conversation with her mom. “This morning I was thinking about how lucky I am to have met you. One small step, one single different decision, is what separated you and I from meeting. If I had been just a little more careful in the entrance exam, we might not be here.”

“Yeah, I…” Izuku paused, remembering his dream that morning. “...was also thinking about you.”

“But, I was just wondering, if I never went to Recovery Girl’s office, we would still be in 1A together, so…Do you think we’d still be together? Somehow, someway, do you think you and I would have gotten together?”

Izuku furrowed his brow as he pondered the question, looking up at the stars again, “...I hope so. But, I’ve always liked to believe there are infinite timelines, filled with infinite universes of all outcomes. So, technically speaking, there are infinite timelines where you and I are together. I-It’s kind of a cop out answer, I know, bu-”

“No, no, it’s…” Kyouka smiled, rolling back over and placing a slow, soft kiss to his lips. “I like that. I love that a lot, actually.”

“I wouldn’t consider it all that lucky, though. All I do is bring bad luck.”

“You have some pretty bad luck, yeah,” Kyouka chuckled, her fingers lightly playing with his hair. “But, you always come out on top, no matter what. So, I’d say it’s a pretty good balance. But, that’s another thing I was thinking about this morning. After everything, I know I’m ready for whatever the future throws at us. Bad luck be damned, but...I’m still scared.”

Izuku nodded, taking a deep breath, “...Me too. But, it just makes days like this, every second of them, even more important. Peace will only last for so long.”

Kyouka raised herself above Izuku, looking down at him in the moonlight. "So...what do we do now, with our fading days of peace?"

"I-...I just want to love you…" Izuku paused, taking a deep breath before continuing his sentence, "...in every way possible." 

It took a few moments for Kyouka to understand just what Izuku was hinting at. As nervous as she was, she was happy she wasn’t the one who ended up asking. 

“...Me too.”

Izuku took a deep breath with wide eyes, nodding as he looked back towards the road. “S-So, uh...Where should we go to...uh, y-you know...do this?”

"Well, my parents are definitely home by now, and my mom will definitely hear...and I'm assuming we can't go back to your apartment either…" Izuku nodded in agreement, also thinking of how to fix their situation with his heart beating rapidly at the idea of what they were both implying. Kyouka blushed, looking around the beach with hesitance. "I mean...no one ever really comes around here."

Izuku's eyes widened, "H-Here? The beach...outside?"

Kyouka cleared her throat, also anxious at the idea, but still willing to go through with it. "W-We're pretty far from any homes. The beach is out of the way. We're the only ones that ever really come here, and it's really late. If we have nowhere else to go, then...this place has always been special to us."

She watched Izuku sit stunned, utterly frozen below her. "I-I...We…"

"W-We really don't have to! It doesn't even have to be tonight, I was nervous anywa-"

"Let's do it."

The musician faltered at the determination in Izuku’s voice, but didn’t let it stop her from letting that boost of confidence affect her, too. Instantly moving down and kissing Izuku with all the passion she could summon. Throwing her leg over Izuku, she began to straddle him as he leaned up to be in a sitting position. His arms snaked around Kyouka’s waist, tightening to press their bodies as close together as possible. 

Lifting her jacks up, Kyouka made sure there was nobody in the vicinity. Just as predicted, they were completely alone. Kyouka allowed Izuku to take her jacket off, his jittery hands purposely caressing her bare skin as they drifted down her arms. He placed her jacket on the blanket to the side, kissing Kyouka's now exposed shoulders and arms. Izuku just couldn't help but admire her flawless, porcelain, pale skin. As he was busy with that, he felt Kyouka's hands uneasily undo all the buttons on his shirt. 

Every breath they took was shaky, their mix of anxiety and excitement coming through. Soon, that was discarded as well, and Izuku's white undershirt remained. Izuku kissed his way up Kyouka's neck until his lips were next to her ear and whispered. *"Are you sure?"*

Kyouka took a few moments to process everything that was happening, realizing just how far they were about to go. 

All the way. 

She wanted it to be special.

*Needed* it to be special.

This was a vastly significant moment with the love of her life. Even if it was only for one night, her feelings about her body were to be cast aside. This was to be a night she would never forget, and the dark side of her mind would not be present for it. 

Kyouka followed Izuku's example, leaning in and whispering in his ear, *"Unzip my dress."*

Kyouka almost laughed when she felt something harden beneath her the moment she said that. 

“O-Oh my God this is actually happening.” First, Izuku placed his chin on her shoulder, finding the zipper on the back of her neck. He moved it all the way down until it reached her waist, and Kyouka let the collar fall from her neck, and the dress dropped down. Izuku kissed down her neck, to her chest, moving down while pulling slightly on the dress, revealing a black, strapless bra. 

Izuku looked up, silently asking for permission. Kyouka, her blush only growing stronger, nodded her head. Izuku took his cue, placing soft kisses on the musician's breasts, moving back and forth between each one while continuing to move the dress down. Now with her main article of clothing pooling at her hips, Kyouka felt Izuku grip her waist tightly.  She hummed, instinctively pressing down into Izuku’s crotch. 

Izuku shuddered and groaned in response, using his grip on Kyouka to rock her lower half back and forth against his. The punk’s internal heat was spiking, her body screaming at her to continue, communicating that through small whimpers in the back of her throat. This was only spurred on as Izuku took both of her jacks into his mouth, rolling them around his tongue and sucking. 

This turned her whimpers into moans as she grinded harder into Izuku, her hands running under his shirt and across the contours of his abs. Izuku's hormones decided the hold on Kyouka's hips wasn't enough, so he moved his hands to her backside, squeezing and helping her in her motions. 

 Izuku moved back slightly so his shirt could be lifted over his head and discarded. When they separated, they looked into each other’s eyes. 

 They could stop now. Kyouka could pull her dress back up, Izuku could put his shirt back on,  they could pack up the blankets, and go home.  But, whatever hesitance or fears they had died the moment they saw nothing but love in their partner’s eyes. Kyouka knew after too long her mind would catch up with her love and lust, so she needed this now. Nothing was going to stop her from making love to the one who meant everything to her.

Kyouka leaned back, leaving Izuku’s body much to his dismay. Lying back on the blanket, Kyouka gulped, took Izuku’s hands and placed them back on her hips, right where her dress clung to her body. Izuku followed her lead, pulling the dress down Kyouka’s legs and off of her body, taking the fishnets with it. Kyouka now lay before him in nothing but black lace, her hands not sure where to go as they tried to cover everything. 

Kyouka was breathing heavily, her face hot with embarrassment. “Stop staring.”

“Sorry! But, I-...I can’t look away, to be perfectly honest with you.”

The musician tried to keep her act up by rolling her eyes, but her heavy blush and slight twitch of a smile betrayed her. “You forgetting something? I can’t be the only one like this.”

“Oh! Right!” Izuku quickly undid his belt, unbuttoning his pants, taking off his socks, and kicking both of them to the side.

Kyouka looked at Izuku’s black boxer briefs and hummed to herself. Not yet acknowledging the significant bulge coming from them, she noticed something else. “I’m surprised. No All Might boxers?”

Izuku laughed, “I-I kinda threw them all out. After knowing him for so long it got kinda weird to wear them.”

“Oh, so your fanboyism has some shame?”

“Kyouka…” Izuku opened his arms wide, gesturing towards the entire area. “We’re about to have sex on the beach. Not even a hidden cove or anything. The road to get here is right over there. I don’t think I even know the definition of shame anymore.”

“Fair enough.” Kyouka hugged herself tight, and brought her legs up just a bit, still a little embarrassed. Izuku leaned down, wrapping one arm around Kyouka and using his other to keep himself steady.  "So...What now?"

Izuku gave an embarrassed smile, “Honestly, I’m just surprised I haven't passed out by now, so...Wing it?”

“Well, we got this far in the relationship by winging it so...might as well trust the process.”

“I-I’ll go first. I...Uh...I want to say something.” 

Izuku propped himself up on both hands, looking down at Kyouka, his eyes roaming all over. Her arms hugged tighter around herself, but she let him continue. 

Izuku leaned in and kissed Kyouka’s forehead. “My life was nothing…” 

Then her cheek.

“...until I met you.” 

Next, her other cheek, “I thought I met my hero…”

A kiss to her nose, “I finally received a quirk.” 

A soft, long kiss to her lips, “But, it all meant nothing until you.”

Red blooming on her cheeks, Kyouka had a small smile, “You prepared this speech?”

Izuku kissed her lips again, cutting her off. 

“Shush, I’m doing a thing.” He moved to her ears as she giggled, “To think I might have missed the greatest thing to ever happen to me, if I was able to control myself and not talk about these wonderful things.” Izuku kissed her left ear, Kyouka’s jack moving up to meet his lips. “True, they jab me more often than not.” He then kissed the other one, “But, I wouldn’t have it any other way, because it’s all a part of the perfect, beautiful package that is Kyouka Jirou.” He moved back to Kyouka’s face, “And everything unraveled from there. From looking into your eyes, that saw something in me that I never could…” he kissed her neck, “to hearing your beautiful voice…” Then, he moved down to her chest “to your spirit, and heart...” Izuku kissed her chest, then took her by both hands, raising them up to kiss down the length of her arms, “to your strength…” He moved back to her chest, a slight sigh escaping his lips, “to be one-hundred percent honest with you, to your boobs that I still can’t stop staring at.”

Kyouka covered her eyes with her arm, “Oh my God…”

Izuku moved his right hand down, cupping one of Kyouka’s breasts as he gave each a kiss. He moved his hand around Kyouka’s back, finding the clip of the bra. He looked to Kyouka for permission, which he received after a shaky breath and nod from her. This made Izuku’s heart pound even harder as he thought about what he was about to bear witness to for the first time. It took a lot of maneuvering, but he finally managed to hear a small click, the article of clothing loosening. Izuku’s hand shakily took hold of the bra, slowly removing it. Kyouka’s arms itched to move, to cover herself, to grab the bra from Izuku’s hands and put it back on, but she resisted with all her might as it was placed with the rest of the discarded clothes. 

The sea breeze washed over her now bare torso, Izuku’s hands resting on her ribcage just underneath her breasts. He carefully caressed each breast, Kyouka’s breath hitching as his fingers ran over her erect nipples. “To your body, that becomes more beautiful every second I look at it.” Izuku leaned down, placing a kiss on Kyouka’s left nipple, taking it into his mouth and rolling his tongue around it.

Kyouka threw her head back, her core heating up at the bliss Izuku was putting her through. 

*“Nngh!~ Ah~...Izu~.”* She gripped Izuku’s hair as he continued to pleasure Kyouka to his heart’s content. He switched to the other breast, giving a few small bites this time as his hand cupped the other one, filling his hand perfectly as he squeezed it. A few minutes went by with Izuku receiving his fill, for now. He needed to move on. He kissed the valley in between Kyouka’s breasts, leaving delicate kisses down her stomach to her navel, his hands reaching around to squeeze her backside once more. “Let me guess. My ass, that you also can’t stop staring at.”

“A-Actually, your legs were next...but, yes. Don’t blame me, you wear leather pants, skinny jeans, leggings, and that dress. What else do you expect me to do? And now you’ve forced my hand. I have to do this.” Izuku flipped her over on her side, kissing the left cheek of her butt. “There, now you can forever say I literally kiss your ass.”

Kyouka covered her face, laughing into her hands, “Holy Hell, Izuku. What is wrong with you?”

“If lovi-”

“I swear if you say, ‘If loving you is wrong, I don’t want to be right’, I’m putting my clothes back on and going home.”

“...Moving on, then.” Izuku lifted Kyouka’s legs up, kissing her calves and moving down between her thighs. “To the legs that stand when I fall, that keep going when I can’t anymore, to support me until I can run for myself again.” 

Izuku reached up, his hands hovering above Kyouka’s panties, waiting for permission to proceed. Kyouka reached down, covering Izuku’s hands with her own and pushing them down to her skin, hooking his fingers in the waistband. Izuku breathed in deep, pulling the cloth down Kyouka’s legs, removing them from her body and placing them with the other clothing. Izuku sat up straight on his knees, basking in the glory of the most beautiful sight he had ever seen.  The light of the full moon shone off the ocean and sand, illuminating the beach in a luminous, bright light. Kyouka’s pale skin glowed angelically, the violet of her hair and eyes contrasted with a vibrancy Izuku couldn’t even begin to describe as he, for the first time, gazed upon Kyouka completely bare. 

“...To all of you. Every, single, last, part of you. Inside and out.” Izuku needed to punctuate his speech, so he laid down on his stomach, placing Kyouka’s legs on either side of his head. “You didn’t just give me my life back. You *are* my life, Kyouka. I love you more than anything.” He watched as a few tears began to spring up in the corner of Kyouka’s eyes, red dusting her cheeks. He kissed the inside of her thigh before putting his lips just centimeters in front of Kyouka’s lower entrance. “Happy Birthday, Kyouka.”

Izuku gave a long lick, her legs immediately tightening around his head as she cried out. 

*“AH!~”* Kyouka quickly covered her mouth, her moans being too loud even though they were alone. Izuku took in as much as he could, plunging his tongue in and flicking it quickly as far as he could. Fluids flowed out onto his face as he continued to eat Kyouka out to the best of his inexperienced abilities. Kyouka moaned through grit teeth, trying to keep herself somewhat quiet, but she wasn’t doing a great job. *“Ooh God!~ Aaah!~”* 

Something which Izuku was happy about, as it was music to his ears he never knew he needed. Originally, he planned to have a song play during their first time, but Kyouka’s voice was all he needed. In fact, it was better. He moved up, using his fingers to tease the folds he left behind and instead began to suck on her rosebud, sending Kyouka to cloud nine. Her muscles below began to tighten, her heat rising as Izuku showed no signs of slowing down. She stopped him, lightly pushing his head away to get his attention. If he kept up, she would have finished quickly. 

“It’s your turn.” 

Izuku backed away, wiping his chin clean, “W-Was that good?”

Kyouka straddled him once more, planting a chaste kiss on his lips, “Very, *very* good. And about your speech…” She kissed him deeply, wrapping her arms tightly around him. “Thank you. I love you, more than you could ever imagine. You’re my life, too.” She kissed his temple, then tugged on his earlobe with her teeth. *“Now lie down.”*

Izuku felt Kyouka’s hand grab the tent his boxers were making, his voice going quiet as Kyouka’s grew stern. 

“Y-Yes, ma’am.” He laid down on his back with Kyouka settling herself between Izuku’s legs. She rolled his boxer briefs down, letting his aching manhood free to stand up properly. Kyouka’s eyebrows rose, humming to herself at the sight. Izuku sat up, resting on his arms with uneasiness in his eyes. “I-Is that a bad hum?”

 “No! No, not at all. You’re definitely not... *lacking* in that department, that’s for sure. Not that I’ve seen someone else’s in person before, but...I can tell you have nothing to worry about.” Kyouka looked down again at the member, maybe about the length of her hand with her fingers fully extended out. Mustering up the courage, she gripped the shaft, causing Izuku to give a low moan. 

That was a good sign. Although, she was fairly certain any sort of friction would cause that reaction by that point, as it was obvious Izuku’s sensitivity was at an all time peak. She could feel his member throbbing in her hands with each beat of his heart, and it was completely warm to the touch. She gave one, curt tug, squeezing a little with her forefinger and thumb as they went over the head. Izuku’s breath hitched again, his body shuddering.

Kyouka pumped a little faster, Izuku’s toes curling as he muttered under his breath about keeping himself together. Kyouka laughed under her breath as she watched Izuku’s face switch expressions by the second. Each involuntary, cute little face he made in an attempt to last as long as he could was satisfying in a weird way. It kinda made her proud to see she was doing well, because Kyouka couldn’t lie and say she knew what to do. Well, she knew *what* to do, just not how to do it well. 

*‘No time like the present, Kyouka.’* Leaning down, Kyouka gave one, small, tentative lick to the head, causing Izuku to immediately flinch, his hips involuntarily bucking at the new sensation.

“O-Oh, wow. Okay. O-Okay, that was…” Kyouka waited for Izuku to continue, but he just sat silently with wide eyes.

“Izuku? Did...Did you break?”

“N-No, just...processing. Continue...please.” 

Kyouka laughed a little, putting her head back down and giving another lick, receiving the same reaction as before. This time she pressed the flat of her tongue against the underside of the head, rolling her tongue over to the other side. These simple actions seemed to be enough to get Izuku to squirm under her, so she started experimenting more. Her hands left their post of pleasuring the shaft, replaced by her jacks wrapping around the length of Izuku’s penis and pumping quickly. She flicked her tongue quickly at the very tip before putting the entire head in her mouth and sucking in. 

*“Oh!~* Okay, waitwaitwaitwait!”

Kyouka quickly released him from her mouth, looking up in concern, “What? Did that hurt?”

Izuku clenched every muscle he could, trying to hold back from finishing right there and then. He just barely managed not to, allowing his body to cool down. “No, not at all. It was...outstanding. B-But, uh...a bit *too* outstanding. I-I kinda don’t wanna...you know... *finish* just yet, because honestly I think I only would have lasted another ten seconds like that, and that's giving me the benefit of the doubt. And, I-I know this might sound weird, b-but I kind of want our first finish to be when we’re actually...well, doing it.”

Kyouka nodded in understanding, knowing that want because she felt the same. 

“Well...then what are we waiting for?” Izuku’s eyes widened as he quickly moved back to his pants bundled up on the blankets, pulling out his wallet. Kyouka chuckled, "Condom in the wallet? Really? That cliché?"

"Where else was I supposed to keep it?" He pulled it out, moving back to Kyouka for her to take. She took Izuku’s member and rolled on the contraceptive, lying back down on the blankets. Izuku pressed himself against Kyouka's nether region, guiding his member to find its entrance. Izuku looked down at his partner, the butterflies in his stomach at an all time high. “Are you ready?”

Kyouka took a deep breath, reaching up to cup Izuku’s face and bring him down to kiss him. She wrapped his arms around his neck, nuzzling her face into the crook of his neck. “With you? Always.” 

“J-Just guide me through it. I don’t want to hurt you.” Izuku readied himself, carefully pushing inside and immediately felt a warm, tight grip around his member. Thankfully, Kyouka was wet enough to not make it too difficult, but that didn’t stop Izuku from pausing when she grimaced in pain. 

“A-Ah, shit.”

“Sorry.”

“No, it’s not y-your fault. Just...keep it slow.” Izuku continued to push, inch by inch he entered Kyouka, pain still present on her features. Finally, he was fully sheathed, both taking a few moments to let themselves settle in. Izuku was trying to fully process the sensation he was feeling, and Kyouka was letting the sharp pain turn into a dull ache. Once Izuku went as far as he could, and didn’t move an inch, awaiting further instruction. After about twenty seconds, Kyouka finally nodded, “Okay. Okay, you can move a little.”

Following the instructions, Izuku slowly and carefully pulled out about halfway, then moved back in. He repeated this short, very slow, careful motion to start off, making sure it wasn’t too painful for Kyouka. He felt bad as a euphoric feeling was washing over him and his love was still in pain. 

Kyouka could feel each small thrust from Izuku send a wave of pain her way, but they very, *very* , slowly began to diminish. Kyouka lowered her legs, letting her feet rest on the soft ground beneath them as Izuku carefully lifted her lower back. She backed out from the crook of his neck, nuzzling her nose into his cheekbone. 

At that point Kyouka was convinced the pain wasn’t going to go away entirely, but thankfully it had reached the stage of being the main feeling. It was enough to push it to the background and focus on the mix of pleasure that was growing. 

“You can go a bit faster now.” Fulfilling her wish, Izuku began thrusting at a slightly quicker pace and letting himself plunge deeper. Pleasure now outweighed the pain, causing a low moan to emanate from the back of Kyouka’s throat. *“Faster.”* Izuku could hear the desire in her voice, pouring gasoline on his inner fire. He now thrusted with a nice, fast pace, entering as far as he could go with each push forward. *“Ooh!~ Ah!~ Ah!~ Ah!~”*

*“Ky-...Ah...K-Kyouka...Hah~...”*

Kyouka was doing her best to keep her voice down. The last thing she needed was her moans echoing out into the night. People really would find them if that happened. But, she couldn’t help herself, her cries of pleasure going right into Izuku’s ear. And without her knowledge, that was spurring Izuku on more and more with each moan.

She remembered back to their first kiss, which took place in the exact spot they were making love for the first time. The feeling of a slow, burning fire consuming them instead of explosions was repeated here, except the fire was hotter than ever. Kyouka tried moving her hips with Izuku’s, bouncing her nether regions against his with every pump. Their mouths met, tongues clashing and exploring. Kyouka sucked on Izuku’s tongue as his thrust became less rhythmic, something she assumed meant he was losing control of himself. He was moaning, making small, almost out of breath grunts. Once again, she couldn’t help but be a little amused at the faces Izuku was making. His brow was furrowed, his tongue pushing into his bottom lip as he was so focused on controlling himself to last longer. He was close to finishing, something which she was feeling build up inside of her as well. But, Izuku’s speed suddenly slowed. He stopped, pressing his forehead against Kyouka’s, sweat dripping down from his face. 

“I don’t want this to end. Not yet.”

Kyouka couldn’t agree more, propping herself up. “Then make the time we have count.” She pushed him back up on his knees, following him without letting him be released from her body. They sat in the position they were in before, with Kyouka straddling Izuku in a sitting position. They didn’t start again immediately, hoping the pause would help them last longer. Instead Kyouka circled her hips, burying her nose into Izuku’s hair.

Izuku, with his head now at a new height, took the opportunity to quickly return his attention to Kyouka’s breasts, his mouth enclosing around the nipples to lick, suck, and bite as much as he pleased. Kyouka moaned, her hands running across Izuku’s shoulders and back, feeling every contour and tense of his muscles. She held back a laugh, remembering Izuku’s adamant naming of calling her boobs “Body Parts of Legend.” He certainly treated them like such.

Of course, physically it made her feel good, but…seeing that balance of love and lust in his eyes, all for her…All these years, feeling like she was *undeserving* of that…

God, she loved him. She knew that he felt undeserving of this, too. Everyone made him feel so undeserving for years, and all he cared about was making others, including her, just feel so wonderful.

“I love you so much,” Kyouka raised his head from her chest, kissing him hard. “You’re so handsome.”

Kyouka pushed him down onto his back, placing her hands on Izuku’s chest, and continued to bounce her lower half onto his. 

Izuku never would have been able to comprehend just how great love-making felt, but having it be with the woman he loved most in the world just made it even better. He wrapped his arms around Kyouka’s waist, thrusting up to meet Kyouka’s bounces. On any other occasion, love and lust were two different things to Izuku. But, watching Kyouka moan with sweat glistening on her pale skin in the moonlight as her breasts bounced with every movement and hitched breath made those two words merge together and form an all new definition of true passion and desire. 

It was moments like that when Izuku knew that if Kyouka were to break up with him for some unholy reason, and it would be her doing the break up because never in Izuku’s right mind would he give her up, he would never date again. 

He wouldn’t want to hurt the theoretical woman. He wouldn’t have the heart to tell them they could never compare to Kyouka, and that it was impossible to come close. 

“Just a little more. I-I wanna keep going.” Kyouka seemed to understand his meaning, switching positions once more to give themselves another small pause. She let Izuku unsheath himself from her, quickly flipping herself over onto all fours. Izuku’s hands found her butt once more, giving a squeeze before moving up to her hips. He entered her again, this time with far less struggle, and Kyouka with far less pain

Izuku knew the end of their activities was coming to a close, at least on his end. So, he stalled, instead focusing solely on Kyouka’s pleasure 

He kissed between Kyouka’s shoulder blades as he pushed into her as far as he could and stayed there. Kyouka’s jacks flung back, wrapping around Izuku’s midsection, pulling her up for her back to meet his chest. She rotated her upper half to meet Izuku’s eyes. Pressing their foreheads together, they gazed at one another, love ever present in their eyes. Izuku kissed her, then her shoulder, then wrapped Kyouka’s arm around his neck so he could put his mouth back on Kyouka’s breasts and move his other hand down to her clit. He wanted to make this as special as possible for Kyouka, giving her everything he could think of.

Using his middle and ring finger, he slowly pressed and rotated his digits on and around her bud. His other hand caressed her breast gently. It was common knowledge Kyouka wasn’t fragile, but he was still scared of accidentally getting carried away with hormones and being too rough. 

He felt his body slowly descend from its nearing climax, hoping he could hold out for just a tad bit longer. 

He began to slowly thrust again, keeping it slow and steady. Both to reduce whatever pain she still had to be feeling, and to give himself some more time.

Which, clearly was failing, as after only about thirty seconds he could feel himself getting ready to finish, his movements becoming faster and more erratic. He exited Kyouka one last time, allowing her to spin around and kiss him again, her legs wrapping around him as they lowered back to the blankets below. Sliding in one last time, Izuku pumped as fast as he could, Kyouka’s walls tightening around his member at an alarming rate. 

“K-Kyouka...I’m close.” 

“Me too.” Izuku felt his sensitivity reach its peak, his member ready to burst at any second. He held on for as long as he could, but it was becoming too much. With one final kiss from Kyouka, he exploded inside of the condom, whimpering a bit into Kyouka’s mouth as he continued to thrust through his orgasm. His large, final thrusts went in as deep as they could, breaking the dam inside of her begging to be released. 

Kyouka moaned as her insides tightened like a coil, finally releasing her pent up euphoria. The tightening walls squeezing Izuku only made him pulse more, his hips bucking continuously as Kyouka began to shake from her orgasm. Soon, they both dropped, their muscles completely spent. Izuku carefully pulled out, rolled over and off of Kyouka, both panting and dripping with sweat. Grabbing the ends of one of the top layer blankets, Izuku covered them, bringing in Kyouka to his hold.

Kyouka gently laid down on Izuku's chest, her body finally staving off the quaking from her orgasm. She reached under the blanket, pulling the condom off of Izuku’s member for him and tossing it to the side near their clothes. Crawling up, she lazily kissed Izuku, their wet hair sticking to each other's foreheads. 

"I-I...I want to say this is the happiest moment of my life...But, everyday with you feels like that. And it just keeps getting better. So I guess...I guess it's more appropriate to say every day since meeting you has been the happiest of my life."

Kyouka gave a breathy chuckle, still recovering. "Even the USJ? Stain? Accidentally hitting you in the face with the BoomBox?"

"All of the above."

Kyouka kissed him again, nuzzling her nose against his. "I feel the same way...I love you."

Izuku wrapped his arms around Kyouka, closing his eyes as he cherished the moment. Burning those words into his mind. "I love you, too." They kissed, the thin blankets protecting them from the sand and the cold, night air not being able to compare to the warmth their bodies shared. 

"You better. Now get me off of this beach before a night time jogger comes by and sees two naked teenagers."

“R-Right.” After a couple more minutes of recovery, they stood up. Albeit, both of their legs were a little wobbly and Kyouka was pretty sore. But, they didn’t care. They redressed in silence, but both beaming at one another. Izuku zipped her dress back up, and they folded the blankets back together, walking off the beach to collect their shoes. Throwing the used condom in the trash, they walked home together, the last train gone long ago. "So...U-Uh...Was I...You know...Good?"

Kyouka blushed, but shrugged, "How would I know? You know that was my first time, too."

"...Right." Izuku slightly slumped, a little disappointed in the answer.

"However…" Kyouka took Izuku's arm, clutching it to her front. "It felt incredible, so you're definitely doing something right." 

Izuku couldn't help but smile at that knowledge, resting his head down on top of Kyouka's. He noticed she was limping a little, clearly still incredibly sore.

Without a word, Izuku stopped them and knelt down in front of her, offering her his back. Kyouka recognized the gesture; how many times had they done this now?

She hopped on, allowing Izuku to pick her up and carry her down the road. She nuzzled into the crook of his neck, fully at peace.

Temporary peace, sure, but…

This night would live in her mind forever.
