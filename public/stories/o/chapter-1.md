# Chapter 1: Gravity

The steam from Historia's tea curled upward, catching the early morning light that filtered through the window. Aris watched it twist and dissipate, tracing patterns that existed for only a moment before vanishing. Outside, the Survey Corps headquarters was coming to life—boots on cobblestone, distant voices, the metallic clank of equipment being checked. Inside their shared quarters, the world felt smaller, contained, almost safe.

Historia's pen scratched against paper. She sat at the small wooden table, blond hair still mussed from sleep, wrapped in a woolen shawl that had once been her mother's. Or so she'd told him, one of those late-night confessions when the walls between them dissolved completely. Aris leaned against the counter, nursing his own cup of tea that had already gone lukewarm, studying her profile as she worked through another stack of correspondence.

"You're going to strain your eyes," he said, voice still rough with sleep.

She didn't look up, but the corner of her mouth quirked. "And you're going to be late for debriefing if you keep standing there."

"Still have time." Aris set his cup down and moved behind her chair, his hands settling on her shoulders. She leaned back into his touch almost automatically, letting out a small sigh as his fingers found the knots of tension in her neck.

"Gods, when did you learn to do that?"

"When you started carrying the weight of three districts on your shoulders." He pressed his thumbs into the base of her skull, working in slow circles. "You've been up since before dawn."

"I had letters to answer." Historia's hand paused above the paper, then set down her pen. "The people in Stohess want answers about the new agricultural policies. They're not wrong to be concerned—the transition's been rough."

Aris hummed in acknowledgment, but didn't push. After two and a half years, he'd learned when to press and when to let things settle. Historia's tendency to absorb everyone's problems as her own was something they'd navigated before, but it still worried him. Not that he'd say so. Not directly.

Instead, he bent and pressed a kiss to the top of her head, breathing in the familiar scent of soap and something else, something uniquely her. "Don't forget to eat."

"I won't." She tilted her head back to look at him, gray-blue eyes soft in the morning light. "Are you nervous about today?"

"Routine recon. Should be fine." Aris straightened, moving back to his cup. The tea was definitely cold now, but he finished it anyway. Waste was waste, and old habits from the Underground died hard.

Historia watched him for a moment, her expression shifting into something he recognized—that look she got when she could see right through his carefully constructed calm. But she didn't call him on it, just nodded and turned back to her papers. That was another thing he'd learned to appreciate about her: she knew when to push and when to let him have his space.

He finished dressing while she worked, pulling on his Survey Corps uniform with the practiced efficiency of someone who'd done it a thousand times. The fabric was worn but well-maintained, the wings of freedom on his shoulders still crisp despite countless expeditions. His gear sat by the door, cleaned and checked the night before, but he'd go over it again before leaving. Always did.

"You know," Historia said without looking up, "you could just say you're anxious. I won't judge."

Aris paused mid-button. "I'm not anxious."

"Mhm." The sound was skeptical, amused. "You've checked your gear three times since you got up. And you're tapping your fingers."

He looked down at his left hand, where his index finger was indeed tapping against his thigh in the steady rhythm he fell into when his mind was working through scenarios. He stilled it, but not before Historia caught his movement in her peripheral vision and smiled.

"Fine," he admitted. "Slightly on edge. It's been quiet lately. Too quiet."

The pen stopped moving. Historia looked up fully this time, her expression serious. "You think something's coming?"

"I think when things are this calm, it usually means something's building." Aris finished buttoning his jacket and crossed to the door, where his ODM gear waited. He ran his hands over the familiar straps and buckles without actually opening anything—just a tactile check. "We know about Marley now. We know about the world outside. But we're still here, still waiting. That doesn't sit right."

Historia was quiet for a long moment. When she spoke again, her voice was softer. "Maybe we've earned a moment of peace."

"Maybe." He didn't believe it, and she probably didn't either, but they let the lie sit between them like a fragile thing neither wanted to break.

The debriefing room smelled of old wood and dust, with maps pinned to every available surface. Aris found a space along the wall, settling into the practiced posture of someone who'd spent years standing through briefings. Jean was already there, leaning against the opposite wall with his arms crossed. He caught Aris's eye and gave a brief nod. Connie was seated in one of the few actual chairs, looking half-asleep, while Sasha had claimed a spot by the window, her attention split between the room and whatever was happening outside.

Levi stood at the front, his presence commanding attention without effort. Hange paced slightly to his left, looking like they'd been up all night—which they probably had, given the scattered papers and the distinct scent of coffee that clung to them.

"Last expedition was clean," Levi said, his voice cutting through the low murmur of conversation. "Minor Titan encounter near the eastern edge of former Wall Maria territory. All accounted for, no casualties, no equipment losses worth noting."

Aris felt the familiar weight of relief settle in his chest, brief but real. Clean runs were becoming rarer, and each one felt like a gift he wasn't sure he deserved. He'd lost friends to expeditions before—everyone had—and the knowledge that this one had been different didn't erase the memory of others that hadn't been.

"Vallois." Hange's voice snapped his attention back. "You mapped the safe route through the forested region, correct?"

"Yes, Commander. The northern approach is viable. Dense canopy provides cover, and the terrain's rough enough that most Titans avoid it." Aris pulled a folded map from his jacket pocket and crossed to the table, smoothing it out. He'd marked it himself the day before, his handwriting precise, routes drawn with the careful consideration of someone who understood that a single miscalculation could mean death for everyone following.

Hange leaned over the map, tracing the route with one finger. "Excellent work. This could save us significant time on future expeditions."

"And gas," Levi added. "Which we're still rationing, in case anyone forgot."

Aris nodded, stepping back to let others study the map. He'd spent hours analyzing the terrain, reading wind patterns, calculating angles. It was the kind of work that came naturally to him—observational, tactical, requiring the kind of spatial awareness that had kept him alive in the Underground and beyond.

"New assignment," Levi continued, his gaze sweeping the room. "Routine reconnaissance beyond Wall Maria. Standard scouting mission, low-risk area based on previous intelligence. Two days, maybe three if weather turns."

Aris straightened slightly. Routine missions were never truly routine—he'd learned that lesson the hard way—but compared to what they'd faced in Shiganshina, what they'd lost, this felt almost manageable.

"Team composition: Vallois leading reconnaissance, Kirstein, Springer, Blouse. Plus Riegert and Thorne." Levi's voice didn't change inflection, but Aris caught the slight emphasis. Leading. Not just participating—leading.

He'd led smaller units before, usually when circumstances demanded it. But formal assignment was different. It meant responsibility, trust he wasn't sure he'd earned.

"Sir," Jean said, "what's our primary objective?"

"Map the territory between checkpoint seven and checkpoint nine. Look for any changes in Titan movement patterns. Report anything unusual." Hange picked up a file, flipping through it. "The area's been quiet, but that doesn't mean it'll stay that way."

Aris caught Jean's eye across the room. Jean gave a barely perceptible shrug—routine, his expression said. But Jean had been doing this long enough to know that routine was a relative term.

"Departure at first light tomorrow," Levi finished. "Be ready. Dismissed."

The room emptied quickly, soldiers filing out with the practiced efficiency of people who had other duties waiting. Aris lingered long enough to commit the mission parameters to memory, then followed the others out into the corridor.

Jean fell into step beside him. "Leading, huh? You ready for that?"

"Always am." Aris kept his tone even, but Jean's knowing look suggested he wasn't fooling anyone.

"You know, most people would be excited about the promotion."

"Most people aren't responsible for getting their team killed if they make a mistake." Aris stopped at the stairs, one hand on the railing. "It's just recon, Jean. Not a promotion."

Jean clapped him on the shoulder, a gesture that felt both friendly and slightly patronizing. "Right. Just recon. Because that's never gone wrong before."

Sasha caught up with them, already talking about what rations she wanted to pack. Connie trailed behind, yawning. The familiarity of it all—the team, the routine, the way they moved together—should have been comforting. And it was, in a way. But Aris had learned that comfort was often just the space between disasters.

Historia's quarters in the royal section of the headquarters were more spacious than their shared rooms, but somehow less lived-in. Aris found her there an hour later, now properly dressed for her role as Queen, her hair braided back in a style that looked both regal and practical. She stood at a different desk, surrounded by advisors and correspondence, but when she saw him in the doorway, she excused herself and joined him in the hall.

"Briefing done?" she asked.

"Tomorrow morning. Routine recon, couple of days." Aris leaned against the wall, studying her face. There were shadows under her eyes that hadn't been there when he'd left, and her shoulders held a tension that suggested the morning's meetings hadn't been pleasant.

Historia nodded, but her attention seemed divided. "Good. That should be safe enough."

"You say that like you're trying to convince yourself."

Her smile was brief, tired. "Maybe I am. When will you be back?"

"Three days, maybe four if weather's bad. Standard protocol." Aris reached out, catching her hand. Her fingers were cold despite the shawl she still wore. "What happened in the meetings?"

"Nothing serious. Just… concerns. About resources, about the policies we're trying to implement. People are struggling, and I can't fix everything as quickly as they need." Historia squeezed his hand, then let go, her expression shifting into something more guarded. "You should get your gear ready. I know you'll want to check everything twice."

"I already checked it last night."

"You'll check it again." Historia's tone was knowing, fond. "I know you, Aris. You won't leave until you're certain everything's perfect."

She wasn't wrong. He'd learned early that attention to detail was the difference between coming back and not coming back. But hearing it stated so plainly made him feel exposed, somehow. Like she could see all his anxious habits laid bare.

"Hey." Historia stepped closer, her hand coming up to rest against his chest. "I'll be fine while you're gone. The meetings are boring, not dangerous. You don't need to worry."

"I'm not worried." The lie came automatically, and Historia's raised eyebrow told him she saw right through it.

"Aris." Her voice was gentle but firm. "I know you want to protect me. I appreciate it. But I can handle a few days of royal duties without a bodyguard."

"That's not—" He stopped, ran a hand through his hair. "I know you can handle it. That's not the point."

"Then what is the point?"

The question hung between them, and Aris found he didn't have a good answer. Or rather, he had an answer, but it was tangled up in things he wasn't ready to articulate: the way his chest tightened at the thought of being too far away to help if something happened, the memory of other people he'd cared about who hadn't come back, the knowledge that safety was always temporary, always conditional.

"I just like knowing you're okay," he said finally, and it was true, even if it wasn't the whole truth.

Historia's expression softened. "I know. And I'll be careful. But you have to let me do my job, just like I let you do yours."

She had a point. He'd never ask her to stop being Queen, just like she'd never ask him to stop going on expeditions. But that didn't make the worry go away. It just made it something he had to live with.

"I should go check my gear," he said.

Historia smiled. "I knew you would."

---

The equipment room was empty except for Aris and the familiar scent of oil and metal. His ODM gear sat on the workbench where he'd left it, each component laid out with the precision of someone who understood that a single faulty strap could mean death. He ran his hands over the harness, checking the leather for wear, testing the buckles. The gas canisters were full—he'd filled them himself yesterday—and the blades were sharp enough to cut air.

Everything was in order. Of course it was. He'd checked it the night before, and the night before that. But there was comfort in the ritual, in the certainty that came from physical verification.

Footsteps behind him made him turn. Jean leaned against the doorframe, arms crossed.

"Again?" Jean asked, though he didn't sound surprised.

"Better safe than dead." Aris picked up one of the gas canisters, turning it over in his hands. The metal was cool against his palms, the weight familiar.

"You know, most people would find a hobby that doesn't involve obsessing over equipment."

"Most people haven't seen what happens when equipment fails at the wrong moment." Aris set the canister down and moved to the blades, checking each one's edge. They'd need sharpening before tomorrow, but that was routine.

Jean was quiet for a moment. When he spoke again, his tone was more serious. "You're going to burn out if you keep this up, you know. The constant checking, the worrying. It's not sustainable."

"I'm not worried. I'm thorough." Aris didn't look up from the blades.

"Right. And I'm just naturally gifted at looking concerned." Jean pushed off the doorframe and moved closer. "Look, I get it. We all do. The weight of what we're doing, the people counting on us. But you can't carry it all on your own."

"I'm not trying to."

"Aren't you?" Jean's voice was gentle, which made it worse somehow. "You know, Historia's pretty capable. She doesn't need you hovering."

Aris's hand stilled. "I know she's capable. That's not—" He stopped, let out a breath. "It's not about her capabilities. It's about…"

It was about the way his world had narrowed to a few points of light in the dark, and Historia was the brightest one. It was about the knowledge that even capable people died, even careful people made mistakes. It was about the Underground, where trust was a luxury and attachment was a weakness, and he was still learning to unlearn those lessons.

"I get it," Jean said, and Aris realized he probably did. They'd all lost people. They all had things they were afraid of losing. "Just… try to breathe, yeah? It's a routine mission. We'll be fine."

"Yeah." Aris turned back to his gear. "We'll be fine."

Jean left after that, leaving Aris alone with his equipment and his thoughts. The afternoon light shifted through the high windows, casting long shadows across the workbench. Somewhere in the building, Historia was probably still working through her correspondence, still trying to solve problems that had no easy answers.

Aris finished his checks and began the methodical process of reassembling everything. Each piece fit into its place with the precision of practice, the familiarity of ritual. By the time he was done, the sun was beginning to set, painting the sky in shades of orange and purple.

He found Historia in their quarters, changed out of her formal wear and back into simpler clothes. She'd lit a lamp against the growing dark, and in its warm light, she looked softer, more like herself and less like the Queen the rest of the world saw. She was reading something—a letter, by the look of it—and didn't look up when he entered.

Aris moved to the window, looking out at the courtyard below. Soldiers moved in practiced patterns, going about evening routines. Beyond the walls, beyond everything, Titans roamed, and Marley waited, and the world held its breath. But here, in this moment, there was just the two of them and the quiet sounds of evening settling in.

"I'm going to miss you," Historia said, and Aris turned to find her watching him.

"Three days. Maybe four. It's nothing."

"It's not nothing." Historia set the letter down and crossed to him, her hand finding his. "Even routine missions can go wrong. We both know that."

Aris pulled her close, her head coming to rest against his chest. He could feel her breathing, steady and calm, and the scent of her hair filled his senses. "I'll be careful."

"Promise?"

"Promise." The word felt inadequate, like most promises did in their world. But he meant it, and she knew he meant it, and for now, that was enough.

They stood like that for a long moment, watching the light fade outside. Somewhere in the distance, a bell rang, signaling the hour. Tomorrow would come, and he'd leave, and they'd both do what they needed to do. But right now, there was just this: the weight of her against him, the warmth of the lamp, the fragile peace of a moment that felt almost normal.

"I should get some sleep," Historia murmured against his chest.

"Probably." Aris didn't move, and neither did she.

Eventually, they'd separate, go through the motions of preparing for sleep, for the next day. Eventually, morning would come, and he'd leave, and the routine would begin again. But not yet. For now, they stayed like that, two people in a world that demanded everything from them, holding onto a moment that belonged only to them.

The light faded completely, and the room fell into shadows. Historia's breathing had slowed, her weight more relaxed against him. Tomorrow, he'd go beyond the walls, and she'd stay here, and they'd both do what they had to do. But tonight, they had this. They had gravity, and that was enough.
