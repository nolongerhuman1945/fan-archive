Neville entered Gryffindor tower cautiously, stepping through the portrait doorway with his wand already drawn. He frowned at the sight of three dishevelled witches holding the Creevey brothers at wand-point; the two muggleborn brothers were bound and unconscious.

"Neville!" Lavender noticed him first and her voice teetered on the edge of hysterical. Her skirt and blouse were torn and there were bruises and scratches all over her. "Thank Merlin!"

Neville turned back and motioned for Blaise and Hannah to join him before spinning back to the group. "What's going on?" He gestured at Padma who was the most level-headed to explain. "Padma? You're not even a Gryffindor; you shouldn't be here."

"She's not?" Blaise muttered. "I thought she was."

"I'm a Ravenclaw. I went to find my sister as soon as the call for the evacuation came, but Parvati insisted on looking for Lavender because she'd come back *here*." Padma sighed. "I wasn't going to let by baby sister go off by herself so…"

"I only came back to the tower because I realised I didn't have my wand, Neville." Lavender babbled almost in tears. "I was so excited about the tournament I forgot it! When I realised I ran back and found it but then…" her eyes landed on the Creevey brothers.

Hannah cleared her throat. "Sue and I saw them on our way into the castle. They said Colin had run out of film and they were going to get some more."

"Yeah? Well, we found the Creevey brothers trying to assault Lavender so they clearly took advantage of the situation." Padma concluded.

"Bastards!" Parvati muttered.

It was so uncharacteristic of the chirpy brothers that Neville couldn't believe it. He glanced at Blaise and found him mid-wand movement.

"Imperius." Blaise declared. "Someone set them on her." He went to wake them up but Hannah stepped in front of him.

"Are you sure that's a good idea?" Hannah waved back towards Lavender. "What if they're still imperiused?"

"The stunning will have reset their brains." Padma answered almost in unison with Blaise.

They looked at each other before blushing and turning away.

Neville woke the brothers up briskly.

Dennis blinked rapidly. "What…?"

Colin came round with a gasp. "Ow! What hit me?" He blanched as he realised he was tied up and so was Dennis. "What…what's going on? Who tied us up?"

"I did." Parvati admitted without a hint of remorse. "You were hurting Lavender."

Colin paled. "I would never!"

"You were both under the Imperius." Blaise informed him. "What's the last thing you remember?"

Colin swallowed hard as he thought. "We'd come into the entrance hall and…" he glanced at Hannah, "Sue and Hannah were there and we talked a bit and then we started up towards Gryffindor tower and then…nothing! I don't remember anything else!"

"We have to leave." Neville said grimly. "We can sort this out later." He reached into his pocket and brought out his emergency portkey, a sock. "This will take you straight to the infirmary." He released the Creeveys. "I'm sorry but you're all going to have to go together."

Padma nodded briskly. Lavender sighed tremulously and Parvati put an arm around her.

"Let me." Hannah took it from Neville and carried it over to Padma. She handed it to the other girl with a soft smile.

Padma frowned as Hannah stepped back. "You're not coming with us?"

"I'm staying with Neville." Hannah said.

Padma held out the sock. Lavender and Parvati took hold of it and Colin encouraged his brother into doing the same.

"Portus!" Padma called out firmly.

Neville watched as they disappeared from view. He exchanged a glance with Blaise who sent a meaningful glance in Hannah's direction briefly.

"Hannah," Neville said cautiously, "how did you and Sue get separated?"

Hannah frowned at him and bristled. "I needed the bathroom if you must know, Neville. She came in with me and went to the sinks while I…you know." She blushed furiously. "I thought she was just outside the stall and I was chattering to her but when I stepped out she wasn't there."

Neville frowned heavily…

"*Someone will betray us." Harry stated as though it was fact.*

*They were sitting on Neville's bed in the dorm. Harry had stayed after the flying session. The others had disappeared to make preparations for the weekend. Neville half-wondered why Harry hadn't but then the weight of the conversation they'd had before stayed with him.*

"*That's not…" Neville went to argue.*

*Harry shook his head. "Learn from our mistakes, right? Pettigrew betrayed my parents, Sirius, Remus, everyone – and he did it without anyone suspecting a thing. We have no way of knowing if we have another Pettigrew in our midst."*

*And that was horrifyingly so true that Neville took a well-earned moment to panic. Then a thought struck him and he turned back to Harry.*

"*How'd you know it's not me?" asked Neville.*

"*Is it you?" asked Harry with a glint of amusement.*

*Neville settled for glowering at him.*

"*Just…" Harry shrugged. "You know, constant vigilance!"*

"Damn it." Neville muttered. He couldn't shake the feeling he was missing something. Sue was gone. Someone had imperiused the Creeveys before the invasion started. Hannah wasn't on the map.

Ron's half-forgotten drunken theory popped into his head. What if Hannah or Sue were actually Crouch?

"Neville," Hannah interrupted his wool-gathering, "shouldn't we be making a move? I want to get to my Dad. He and the others could be at the Headmaster's office by now."

"We should." Neville agreed. He didn't want to take out the map in front of her; they'd have to take their chances. He glanced at Blaise who nodded as though he'd understood.

If they believed Hannah's story potentially Sue was Crouch…but if she wasn't telling the truth…

He sighed and led them back out of the tower.

o-O-o

For what seemed like endless moments, there was nothing but the dark of the Forest before them; scarily silent and undoubtedly brimming with threat, a cold stealing over the ground and through the air as though the Dementors didn't care who knew they were lurking.

And perhaps they didn't, Albus considered. Hagrid stirred beside him, fidgeting with the club he held. Kingsley Shacklebolt glanced at the Hogwarts gamekeeper but kept silent. He and the rest of the auror contingent waiting with Albus were tensed; waiting. The werewolves shifted restlessly beyond them.

They'd heard of the casualties back at the castle, heard of people winking out from the map; knew they'd already taken losses…

Suddenly, it was as though a switch was flicked –

Vampires burst from the treeline in wave…

"LUMOS MAXIMUS!" yelled Albus loudly.

Light filled the sky as though it was day – Albus's power at full force – and

A whip of fire took out five vampires as Shacklebolt raced to meet the threat…

Hagrid clubbed three into the Black Lake where the Squid caught them tightly.

"Dementors!" Someone called out as they drifted into view behind the vamps, like a wave of black evil.

Fawkes flashed into being; landing on Albus's shoulder with a loud brilliant trill. And Fawkes sang…the song lifting Albus's heart…

Albus lifted his wand. His mind filled with thoughts of love and family; laughter in their childhood home where their father ruffled his sons' hair, kissed his daughter's forehead; where their mother scolded them for pranks with barely hidden mirth; where Abe called him brother and Ariana gave him socks…

"EXPECTO PATRONUM!" Albus called out strongly, oblivious to Hagrid plucking away a vampire who had managed to steal close to him away and crushing its head.

A fierce wild phoenix erupted from Albus's wand and swept ahead of him.

It sent the Dementors tumbling back to the Forest…inhuman cries filling the sky as Aragog's children found a meal.

Patronus after patronus burst from the ward line and leapt towards the Forest; a duck and a tiger; a squirrel and a snake…

All fighting for the Light.

Albus thought of Harry and lifted his wand. "EXPECTO PATRONUM!"

Another massive phoenix patronus burst free and scattered the Dementors.

And still another wave of vampires emerged.

Albus set his shoulders and took a breath.

He would not let them pass.

He would fight to the end.

o-O-o

Severus barely repressed the flinch as Voldemort stepped back finally and let go. The Dark Mark burned and Severus could barely lift his arm.

"Bring me my clothes." The Dark Lord commanded imperiously.

Severus took a deep breath and summoned the bag of clothing they had set aside earlier. "Your apparel, My Lord."

Voldemort cast a spell and his clothes flew around him in a tornado that hid his naked body from view.

It was a decent body, Severus reflected, disgusted. He had brewed the potion to perfection. Perhaps it said something that his greatest achievement was the resurrection of the darkest wizard of all time. He shuddered lightly.

He fingered the mirror in his pocket.

At least Potter was following the plan and had hidden himself. Now there only needed an opportunity – an opening for Severus to tell Black where they were. He had hoped to speak the secret aloud when Voldemort called the Death Eaters to him but the Dark Lord had circumvented that idea. Severus practically vibrated with frustration.

"Better." Voldemort declared. "Now, Peter; rise and you will receive your reward."

Severus repressed the urge to grimace. Pettigrew deserved nothing but what he was doing; writhing around in the dirt in pain. He barely paid attention as Voldemort set to making the rat a new silver appendage.

Clearly, Severus decided abruptly, if the Dark Lord wasn't going to give him an opening. He would have to make one.

His eyes fell to the tangle of rope where Potter – *Harry* had been tied up. He had vowed to keep Lily's son safe; he had promised himself he would see the Dark Lord dead for killing her. If he was to succeed, he couldn't take the chance on an opening suddenly arising; he had to create one.

Of course, Severus mused as Peter cooed and babbled about his hand, the moment after he created the opening, he'd be dead at the Dark Lord's wand but…he could use those vital seconds to attack and try to land some damage that would help weaken the dark wizard.

And what was his life worth?

Far better that he sacrifice himself for the cause than Potter, than Harry. Yes, mused Severus as the first Death Eater arrived, he would wait for the right moment and give Black the secret. He would sacrifice his life to enable Harry to live and defeat the Dark Lord. If such an act was right for Lily, than it was right for him too. He was ready to die.

o-O-o

"Minister!"

"Minister, what's your…"

"Minister, where is Harry Potter?"

"Minister, do you believe…"

Percy winced at the noise level in the ballroom of the Black Estate and wiped his brow tiredly. He wished fervently that he'd chosen a different assignment. Maybe he could have stayed with his father and brothers at Hogwarts or gone with Charlie to guard Saint Mungo's, but he had believed that he would be an asset to the evacuation, able to quickly shepherd the kids through the Ministry to the Black Estate where they would be safe.

"Ladies and Gentlemen," Cornelius's voice rose above all the chatter as he took the stage at the front of the ballroom, "please, if you can all be quiet for a moment, I have a statement!"

The crowd settled.

It was a weird mix of Ministry personnel – they had evacuated at the same time as Hogwarts, the tournament crowd including the press, and some of the Hogwarts staff and students.

"Firstly, I want to thank you all for your patience and cooperation." Cornelius began a touch pompously but he was dressed only in trousers with colourful bright green braces, and a crisp white shirt with the sleeves rolled up. "I know many of you have questions about what is happening, why you've been brought here. I have the following statement."

Percy's eyes widened as his former girlfriend offered the Minister a piece of parchment.

"In June last year Lord Black presented evidence to the Ministry of a threat to his ward and soon-to-be-son, Lord Potter. This threat was the wraith of the former Lord Voldemort, also known as the wizard Tom Riddle."

A murmur went around some of the crowd but Percy could see that it didn't appear to be news for the Hogwarts students.

"Together the Ministry as a whole with Lord Black have been seeking to contain this threat. Unfortunately despite our best efforts, Voldemort managed through his agents, the wanted criminals Bartemius Crouch Junior and Peter Pettigrew, to place Harry Potter into the tournament as a means to torture and kidnap him for a ritual that would take place on the eve of the solstice; this very night."

There was a hushed silence.

"In the knowledge that the kidnap attempt would take place and that there would likely be an attack on elsewhere in the magical world this night, we have made preparations." Cornelius looked out steadily at the crowd. "Even now Ministerial forces, the werewolf packs of Europe, devoted Hogwarts' staff including Albus Dumbledore, fight against the forces of darkness at Hogwarts. More including Lord Black and his allies are in place to assist young Harry in his fight against Voldemort."

He raised a hand when muttering began.

"There is a prophecy spoken years ago that declared Harry James Potter to be the one to free us from Voldemort. We applaud the courage and bravery of that young man in stepping forward to meet his destiny and fate tonight; to fight for us; to fight for the Light. We all hope and pray that Harry will succeed."

Percy wasn't surprised when the Minister paused and allowed everyone to absorb that news.

"Lord Black has provided his home to us as a safe haven. The wards here are strong enough to deter Voldemort and his followers. You will be made comfortable while we wait for news. I ask for your indulgence and continued patience."

He stepped away without asking for questions and immediately was swallowed up by a small group from the Potter alliance and Bertie Croaker. Percy recognised Daniel Greengrass and Tiberius Ogden.

Percy began to make his way over to them. There had to be more that he could do than simply wait around like a spare part. He pushed past one group people, round another and…walked straight into Penny.

She stumbled and he hurriedly reached out to steady her.

"Percy." Penny smiled at him tentatively.

"Penny." Percy reluctantly let go of her. "Apologies, I was trying to get to the Minister to offer my help and…"

"You could help me." Penny cut in. She flushed at his wide-eyed look and brushed her fringe away from her forehead; an adorable habit she had when she was nervous. "I mean, there's lots to do and I…I could do with some help."

"Then you have it." Percy declared.

She smiled brightly at him. "Come with me then."

Percy nodded in satisfaction as he followed her out of the ballroom. He just hoped the rest of his family were safe.

o-O-o

Harry watched silently as the Death Eaters arrived.

One by one they came; clothed in black apparel apart from the white masks. The graveyard filled until more than twenty stood there.

At the sight of their Dark Lord more than one prostrated themselves; some did not. Harry figured that Tom was taking note of each and every one.

"Welcome back my followers." Voldemort began smoothly. He walked the length of the loose line the Death Eaters had formed.

"As is evident, I have returned." Voldemort cast a hard look at the group. "Those who believed me vanquished by a mere babe should lower themselves to the ground and grovel before me."

One stooped as though to follow the instruction before halting in a jerky motion when he realised he was the only one.

Harry grimaced. That Death Eater was an idiot, he thought dryly; whoever it was had just effectively confessed to his Dark Lord that he'd thought Harry had vanquished him.

Voldemort unleashed another crucio and the Death Eater fell to the floor screaming in agony.

Harry looked away, the memory of his own time under Voldemort's curse leaping into his mind.

"Let that be a lesson to you, Avery, never to doubt me again."

Avery crawled over to kiss the hem of the Dark Lord's robe. "My Lord."

Voldemort briskly ordered him back in line. Harry winced at the way Avery was limping.

"None of you should doubt me again." Voldemort said strongly. "I told you long ago that I am immortal and so tonight you have your proof." He paused. "But perhaps I can forgive your doubts as I was tricked those years ago; tricked by a smart witch using Old Magic." He ran a hand down his body. "But I have removed the protection Harry Potter once carried and if he wasn't a coward hiding from me among the gravestones I would prove it to you." He smiled nastily. "I will once Nagini finds him and herds him back to face me."

Nobody spoke.

"I've called you here at the start of my resurrection, at the start of a new beginning for us," Voldemort said. "Even now my army is storming Hogwarts. It will be mine before the night is out and then a new dawn will be upon us and we will begin to build a new wizarding world. We will rid ourselves of the filth that inhabit our hallowed halls…"

One of the Death Eaters stepped out of the loose formation they had formed and removed his mask. Benjamin Nott gazed at his Dark Lord with steady eyes.

Harry swallowed, his discomfort forgotten as the sense that something of great importance was about to happen. He hunched down but kept his eyes on the centre of the graveyard.

Voldemort glared at Nott. "Why have you interrupted me, Nott?"

Nott sighed and with a gesture the mask in his hand disappeared. "I remember this speech the first time you gave it. All of us sitting in the Slytherin common room, talking about how you would change the world and we would be by your side. You promised a great many things and we would have followed you anywhere."

"Do you no longer believe in me, Benjamin?" Voldemort said silkily. "Has my one defeat so shaken your faith in me? When I drag the boy before you and show you he is just a boy who survived because of his mother's luck, will that strengthen your faith?"

Nott hummed. "My faith died the night Sebastien died."

There was no sign of recognition on Voldemort's face.

"You will not remember him," Nott said bitterly, "for what was he to you but another pawn in your game? But he was mine and you killed him. You've killed so many of us because that is your true goal. Not to lead us into a glorious new age but to simply destroy the world which would not recognise or help a penniless orphan boy until he gained enough power for the truth of that not to matter."

"You deny me because of I killed some stupid child?" Voldemort sneered in disbelief.

"A child I loved." Benjamin stood straight. "Family." He met Voldemort's hard eyes with courage. "I will not let you harm my family again."

Voldemort's handsome face twisted into something ugly. "You challenge me, Benjamin Nott?" He gestured dismissively. "You are old and powerless."

"I may be old," Nott acknowledged dryly, "some of us have lived with the same one body for the past sixty odd years after all, but I am far from powerless and there has always been magic in this world you have not understood, Tom Marvolo Riddle. My ancestors once vowed to protect this world and I will follow them now." He smiled suddenly and lifted his voice. "The House of Nott surrenders to the House of Black."

Voldemort's wand flicked outward, green lightening snapping forth…

Nott didn't even go for his wand, he stood and let the curse take him.

Harry's eyes slid shut as the dull thud of Nott's body hitting the ground echoed across the cemetery like thunder.

"Does anyone else dare deny me?" Voldemort shouted, whirling around to face his followers, black hair streaming behind him, his robes swirling around him.

Another lifted his hand and removed his mask. Wilkes looked out at Voldemort disgruntled. A few others unmasked.

Harry's heart beat fast in his chest. It was all those who held détentes with the House of Black; Gibbon, Selwyn…all of them…

"You should not have killed him." Selwyn said, his voice shaking but his face was set in determined lines. "Unlike you, he was a pureblood Lord!"

Voldemort glowered at them. "You think you better than I? The Heir to Slytherin?"

"Our magic has protected this world for centuries." Wilkes replied gruffly. "It will protect it for centuries long after we are dead and you have no part in that. You claim a blood status that is not your own and kill everyone no matter what their blood!"

"We followed you blindly once." Selwyn said. "We will not follow you again."

Voldemort reacted violently, the torture curse landing on Selwyn and sending him to the ground in agony.

Wilkes stepped forward as though he couldn't stop himself. "Do you intend to kill and torture us all?"

The curse blinked out and Selwyn huddled on the ground.

Voldemort regarded them with an amused lift of his eyebrows. "I only intend to kill and torture those who are disloyal." He waved his hand down the line. "Who is loyal to me here?"

Avery immediately stepped forward to stand behind Voldemort. Peter scurried into place. Others slowly started to break the line and move. Eventually only those who had unmasked were left on their own along with one more.

Voldemort took a step towards that one Death Eater. "You, Lucius? You deny me?"

Lucius tugged the hood from his head and unmasked. He grimaced but he kept a dignified silence.

"So Black has been successful in seducing you." Voldemort said tutting.

For once Harry felt sorry for the Malfoy patriarch. Although Lucius's oaths to the House of Black wouldn't stop him pretending disloyalty if he was desperate enough, they would make it difficult for the wizard.

Voldemort paced around the wizard and froze. "What is this?" He hissed.

He grabbed Lucius's arm and with his wand tore away cloth to reveal the Dark Mark. He pressed his wand against it and Harry saw Lucius's face distort with pain.

"A beacon?" Voldemort snarled.

Harry's eyes widened. Was Sirius on his way?

"What did you sell me out for, Lucius? Your life? Your magic? Both?" Voldemort lashed out again. A cutting curse slashed through Lucius's leg and he fell to the ground with an agonised cry. "CRUCIO!"

The curse hit Lucius and he screamed.

Harry couldn't bear Lucius's cries. Whether Lucius had worn the beacon willingly or not, he was under the protection of the House of Black. With a thought the cloak slid away and into a pocket.

"STOP!" Harry sprang forward from his hiding place and banished a headstone into the path of the curse with the Elder wand.

Lucius remained on the ground, gasping and trembling. In the eerie twilight, Harry could see that the leg Voldemort had hit was bleeding badly.

Voldemort turned to Harry with a sneer. "Potter." He twirled his wand through his fingers. "You would reveal yourself for *Lucius*?"

"For family." Harry said, remembering Nott's words.

Lucius's gaze flickered to him and he gave a short nod of acknowledgement, of confirmation. Harry's heart lifted a touch even as fear curled through them. Sirius was on his way. He gripped his wand tighter.

Voldemort lifted his eyebrows. "I think you actually believe that."

Harry pressed his lips together. "He's protected."

"Protected?" Voldemort laughed harshly and a murmur went through the assembled line of Death Eaters. He stared malevolently at Harry. "You cannot protect him, Harry Potter. You cannot protect any of them." His arm snapped outward, the Killing curse leaving his wand…

The green light sped toward Lucius…

Harry reached out his hand and the silver snake of the Blacks appeared…it wrapped itself around Lucius…

The Killing curse arched downward…

Lucius and the snake disappeared in a shower of silver…

The curse impacted the grass and the ground cracked open.

Voldemort howled a denial and whirled on Harry. His black hair streamed out behind him, his nostrils flaring wide. "You will pay for that, Potter!" But Harry could see the flicker in his eyes; Harry could see the doubt and uncertainty that had crept in.

"'And he shall have power the Dark Lord knows not.'" Snape said stepping out from the line behind Voldemort.

His words travelled like lightening across the graveyard and Voldemort tensed as they impacted as sharply as though they were knives.

"Severus!" Voldemort snarled. "You challenge me?! You take his side? The son of the wizard who stole your witch?"

Snape stared down Voldemort; eyes dark with anger. "Better his side than the monster who killed her." He sneered. "The cemetery at Little Hangleton can be found behind the church." He declared and then he attacked.

o-O-o

Albus allowed he was a touch winded as he paused and took a breath before levelling a group of vampires with a directed sunlight charm.

To his left a bloodied Shacklebolt sent another vampire to dust.

And another wave of Dementors moved out of the Forest.

"We can't keep this up!" Shacklebolt gasped.

"Yes, we can," Albus said gravely, "and we must!"

Suddenly, a cacophony of pops were heard. The Hogwarts House elves lined up on their side of the ward line, ready to fight, ready to die.

Fawkes streamed across the space and darted in between the Dementors singing loudly. An anguished shriek erupted from the deadly creatures and one stretched out a bony hand towards the bird…

Albus slashed a cutting curse across the space between them and dismembered the Dementor's limb before it could touch his familiar. He raised his wand. "EXPECTO PATRONUM!"

They would prevail. Hogwarts would not fall.

He would stand until there was no breath left in his body.

o-O-o

Arthur scurried back as the vampire reached for him and suddenly there was a werewolf leaping…it took the throat of the vampire and sent it crashing to dust on the staircase below.

And there was silence.

"We're clear!" Flitwick's voice boomed through the staircase.

Arthur staggered to his feet. Blood ran freely down the side of his face but he couldn't remember how he'd been injured.

A pale and pained Leonard helped Richard stand and the head of the House of Bones hopped gingerly on one foot, unable to place weight on what appeared to be a broken ankle. Beside him Krum held one arm to his side protectively; it was clearly broken.

They all glanced at the bodies around them. Mercenaries littered the staircase; vampire dust covered the stone. The Diggorys remained still.

"I need to get to the Headmaster's office." Arthur said, his only thought for his own sons. They had gotten away; he knew that much. He'd seen them disappear into the hidden tunnel. He hoped they were safe.

Flitwick came down as far as he could; a dozen aurors behind him; the werewolves gathered off to the side and sat down, waiting. The damaged staircase had creating a yawning chasm between Arthur and the path to the office.

"Right," Viktor said coughing wetly, "ve should…"

"You should go to the infirmary, Mister Krum." Flitwick advised immediately. He brandished the parchment that Arthur knew was a copy of the Marauder's map. "You all should. According to the map there's a second wave of invaders coming through the Divination classroom."

Arthur's heart sank. "I need to go to my boys."

"Arthur…" Richard protested.

"No, you go to the infirmary, but I," Arthur shook his head, "they're my children!"

Richard nodded in understanding. "We still haven't found Sue." His voice edged on hysteria.

"I'll go with Arthur." Leonard said. "I can find the girls."

"Neither Miss Abbott nor Miss Bones are within Hogwarts' walls according to the map. They must have evacuated." Flitwick said.

Richard raised a shaking hand to his eyes, hiding his tears of relief.

"Thank Merlin for that." Leonard said. "Still, I'll go with Arthur and…" he'd barely taken a step when he grimaced and held a hand to his side. It came away bloody.

"All of you to the infirmary then apart from Mister Weasley." Flitwick waved his wand and Arthur found himself floating to the upper part of the staircase. He was gently set down.

Richard pulled a sock from his pocket and a moment later the three men on the lower landing were gone.

Flitwick gestured at Arthur. "This way."

They set off up the stairs and took the next landing, hurrying down a corridor.

Flitwick suddenly stopped them.

Arthur frowned. "What's…?"

"Look!" Flitwick pointed.

Grey bilious smoke filled the end of the corridor.

They went forward cautiously.

As they peered through the smoke they could see the raging fire beyond; a burning gauntlet of flame and fiery horror.

"Fiendfyre!" Arthur gasped.

"Yes," Flitwick said darkly, "set and left to roam." He shook his head. "We'll need all wands to get through."

"TAKE COVER!" yelled a voice behind them and Arthur ducked as a bright blue spell hit the wall above him.

He turned and his eyes widened. Another group of vampires and mercenaries had flanked them at the rear.

Ahead of them was the fire…

They were trapped!

o-O-o

Moody reviewed the map with a grimace.

Albus was just about holding the Forest ward line with a group of werewolves, aurors and Unspeakables. The kids were still some way from the office but they were on their way. At least Longbottom had gotten his strays to the infirmary, but it looked though as if he'd decided to head to the Headmaster's office too. Flitwick was mid-battle with a second invading force and it looked like he needed reinforcements. The only ones available were right in front of Moody protecting the platform.

"Alpha!"

Gregor responded immediately. "Moody." He saluted him carefully.

"I need you and your men here." Moody pointed at the map.

Gregor raised his eyebrows. "I will send my men but I will remain."

"No need." Moody said briskly. "I can take care of myself. Just take care of that lot!"

For a long moment it looked as though Gregor was going to argue and Moody wondered again at whether it had been wise to involve the Alpha in the fight. He had to be fighting his instinct to run things constantly.

Gregor gave in with a huffy under-growl. "Very well." He whistled and his men followed from the pitch.

Moody focused on his work; sending patronus messages to Flitwick to let him know help was on the way; to the Minister who required updating; to Albus…

He froze.

The hairs on the back of his neck prickled and he grasped his wand firmly, silently casting a shield.

"Reveal yourself!" Moody ordered. "I know you're there!"

A shimmer in the air in front of the platform caught his eye and a moment later the disillusionment spell fell and Dennis Travers Junior stood in front of Moody.

"Well, well, well." Moody said brightly.

"You killed my father." Dennis said angrily. "I will have my revenge!"

"You're an idiot." Moody responded. "But if it's a fight you want…" he grinned, his magical eye whirling, "it's a fight you'll get!"

o-O-o

Hermione felt like she couldn't breathe. Her heart pounded in her chest. Her skin prickled with goose-bumps. She felt judged as Morgana's eyes swept around the room before they settled on Andromeda.

"You have summoned me, Andromeda of the House of Black." Morgana said sternly.

"We seek your help to protect our child, Morgana of the line of Le Fey." Andy bowed her head in respect.

"Harry of the House of Potter, of the House of Black is shielded by my blessing." Morgana returned evenly. "What other help would you have me give to the Raven who is Death's Champion, Master of Death's Hallows?"

Hermione swallowed the urge to jump in and speak.

"Riddle has stolen his blood this night to bring about his resurrection." Andy answered respectfully. "We believe with this act he has negated the shield of Lily and of yourself."

Morgana's strong features settled into thoughtful contemplation. "So you have said; so it is. The child no longer has my blessing."

"We wish only for you to restore what has been stolen from our child." Andy said.

Morgana tilted her head. "What is lost is not so easy to restore." She gazed at Andy. "I will ask but three questions, one to each of the witches who stands before me, and all must answer truly or the blessing will be forfeit. Do you agree?"

Andy sent a quick glance around the room and Hermione nodded along with the others.

"We agree." Andy replied.

"What is Harry to you truly, Andromeda of the House of Black, the House of Tonks?"

"He is hope and salvation of my family." Andy said quietly. "He is the Light that fights the Dark, but more than that he is the heart of our family. He is Sirius's son and heir and he is beloved, and it is for him that our family has been reconciled and renewed with love." Her eyes flashed to Narcissa. "Bonds that were broken have been healed," she glanced at Hermione, "and new bonds created with those who love us. He is our heart."

"And to you Narcissa of the House of Black, of the House of Malfoy, what is Harry to you truly?"

Narcissa's eyes glittered. "He is the hope and salvation for my children." She placed a hand over the heavy swell of her belly. "He is Sirius's reason for being; for him my cousin would tear down mountains and raise up fire; as any parent would for their child. He is the reason why I and my children have safety and shelter." Her eyes went to Augusta. "He is the reason why I would choose the Light and reject the Dark." She also looked at Hermione. "He is our shield."

Hermione wasn't surprised when Morgana turned to Dora next.

"What is Harry to you, Nymphadora of the House of Black, of the House of Lupin?"

Dora's chin came up and her shoulders straightened. "He is hope and salvation for my pack." She took a breath. "He is the reason for every action Sirius takes; for every action my husband makes. He is their reason for living; he is their North star and he shines with the Light so much it blinds me sometimes." Her gaze moved to Ginny. "He is the knight in shining armour little girls dream about," and she looked at Hermione, "and he is hero who chooses the girl strong enough to stand beside him." She looked back at Morgana. "He is our spirit."

Morgana hummed. "You have answered the first question truthfully."

Hermione gave a sigh of relief. One question down and one to go.

o-O-o

"*NAGINI!*" Voldemort hollered, batting away Snape's Sectumsempra spell as though it were a fly.

The snake sprang out of nowhere, striking Snape outstretched wand hand with deadly accuracy.

Harry cast to banish her and his spell was also countered by Voldemort.

Voldemort spun to face Harry and cast a deadly purple curse. Harry shielded himself immediately, leaping away.

But there were pops around them; the cavalry arriving. Someone flung a sock at Snape and he disappeared.

"*MY PREY!*" hissed Nagini outraged.

And from the sky Hedwig struck out at the snake, claws raking across Nagini's body before Hedwig evaded the strike back and took to the air again. Another bird, a small sparrow that Harry recognised as Caro's animagus form struck while Nagini was focused on Hedwig; claws raked over the snake's tail leaving bloody tracks.

Harry yanked his eyes away from the sight and focused on his enemy.

Voldemort and the loyal Death Eaters gathered to the right. Beside his Dark Lord, Pettigrew's eyes were round with fear.

Harry felt Sirius's hand on his shoulder; Remus to his other side. Around them stood the Rat Squad, Amelia and the Death Eaters who had cast Voldemort aside.

"Too much of a coward to face me alone?!" Voldemort sneered.

"I'm never alone, Tom." Harry replied strongly.

"Tom Riddle," Amelia intoned sternly somewhere to his left, "you are under arrest for terrorist attacks against the lawful government of Magical Britain, for the invasion of Hogwarts and the kidnapping and assault of Lord Potter." She gazed around his followers. "Pettigrew will be arrested for murder but so far none of the rest of you have actually committed a crime. Walk away now or you will face charges."

Someone at the back tried to apparate and failed.

Voldemort struck out without even looking and killed him. "Fight or die!" His eyes glittered with madness. "Potter is mine!" He cast a frightening dark maroon curse that would boil the skin from bones…

Harry responded, the Elder wand countering the spell immediately.

And the battle was begun.

o-O-o

Sirius transformed and leaped to charge Voldemort.

It had been absolute torture waiting for the signal to attack.

Lucius had been ordered to wear the beacon to allow them to get close. It was an invention of MI7 for use by their operatives. They hadn't been sure if the magic of the Fidelius would mask it but it had sounded through loud and clear. Sirius didn't regret the order regardless of what Lucius had endured because of it. The beacon had led them to the church, allowed them to be close…close enough to hear when Snape sacrificed himself to finally let them in.

Sirius spared a thought for his childhood nemesis; the snake's attack had looked brutal and he knew she was poisonous. He hoped Bill and Caro remembered that; as the treasure team they were on snake-killing duty as it remained a possible final horcrux.

Remus had declared dibs on Wormtail and Sirius wasn't going to deny Moony his chosen battle. Not when it gave him the chance to stay and fight with Harry.

Voldemort glowered and sent a spell his way. Sirius evaded and landed behind Voldemort. He went to move forward but before he could a blow to his side had him stumbling away. Sirius transformed immediately – only just in time to shield against another blasting spell. He scented something but nothing was there…

A hand caught his roughly around the wrist.

And suddenly the air in front of him shimmered and fell away to reveal a figure.

"You!"

"Me!" Crouch agreed tersely. "You took Rab from me and now you'll pay!"

"Bring it, Crouch!" Sirius said, his mind filling with every threat the wizard had made against Harry; every hurt he'd inflicted. He fingered his wand in his free hand and started to lift it. A stinging hex would free his wrist…

"Oh I'll bring it. But first," Crouch held up a cup which glimmered briefly with the name of Harry Potter, "PORTUS!"

Sirius's eyes widened with horror and the portkey hook took him, taking him away from Harry. Crouch's maniacal laughter sounded loudly in his ear.

o-O-o

Hermione watched as Morgana's assessing gaze moved onto Molly.

"Molly of the House of Weasley, you will be the first to answer the second of my questions. What is the true reason you wish me to bless Harry?" Morgana looked at her expectantly.

"Because he is only a child." Molly answered immediately. "He needs protecting no matter how much power or responsibility he has. Because if his own mother can't be there to stand between him and evil, we must."

Hermione smiled at Molly's blunt answer; it was so characteristic of Ron's mother to focus on Harry's youth.

"And you, Augusta of the House of Longbottom, what is the true reason you wish me to bless Harry?"

"Because he is more than a child." Augusta responded. "He is the Light sworn to protect an alliance on every battlefield against the Dark. Because if we, like his mother before us, can stand beside him shoulder to shoulder against evil, we must."

"And Minerva, what is the true reason you wish me to bless Harry?"

"Because he is at heart only a teenage boy." Minerva replied, her voice rich with emotion. "He dreams of a future with a family who love him and who he loves; he dreams of nothing but peace and the chance to live a happy life. Because if he is to succeed, we must give him every chance."

Morgana moved her gaze to Griselda and asked her question.

Griselda lifted her eyes to the spirit of the most powerful witch in their history. "Because he is a leader of wizards and witches. He is the hope of our world and will shape our future with his magic. Because if he is to succeed, we must give him every chance."

"The second question is answered truly." Morgana declared.

o-O-o

Neville rounded a corner with extra care. He was sweating heavily; the air seemed warm – too warm. He wiped his brow and moved forward. They were only a couple of corridors from the Headmaster's office.

"This heat isn't right." Blaise commented quietly. His eyes darted to Hannah who was just in front of them. He'd kept his voice low enough not to carry.

"I think there's a fire." Neville agreed. "I'm thinking I'm glad we practiced that fire suppression spell with Harry."

"Who knew practicing for a tournament would work out so handy when fighting for your life?" quipped Blaise.

Neville shot him an amused look. He just caught a sound in the wall he'd just passed and quickly brought them to a halt. "Hannah!" He hissed.

She stopped, looking back at him with an irritated look which he remembered well from their final days together; it had been an almost permanent expression in the run-up to their break-up.

He waved her back to them and gestured for them all to take covering positions on the other side of the wall behind a statue and a suit of armour. He raised his wand.

A panel slid to the side and a dusty Fred emerged, cautiously, with his wand first. Fred's gaze scanned the corridor and stopped at the statue which hid Hannah. Neville came out of hiding and raised a hand for the others to join him.

Fred nodded and made some kind of signal behind him. The rest of the students involved with the Hogwarts spell trooped out of what Neville could see was a hidden tunnel. They all looked shell-shocked, weary and pale to varying degrees. The panel slid shut soundlessly behind George who was the last to exit.

"Neville!" Ron grasped his shoulder tightly. "Neville, do you have a map? Dad had ours! I need to check on my Dad and…"

"We got attacked." Natalie explained, brushing her hair back from her eyes. She was maintaining a calm façade but her eyes were filled with anxiety. "Viktor stayed back with Mister Weasley, Lord Bones and Lord Abbott."

Hannah frowned heavily and paced away from the group towards the other wall as though to examine the panelling.

Neville squeezed Ron's shoulder. "I've got the map. Let's get you and the others to the Headmaster's office and we can see where your Dad is."

Ron opened his mouth to argue but Natalie shook her head.

"Neville's right." Natalie said authoritatively. "We need to get to the office and do the spell. If they're still in danger us activating the defences will help them."

"At least we have a Hufflepuff now." Draco commented.

"I don't think we have her." Luna said in a strange tone that made them all stop and look at her before following her gaze.

Hannah stood there with her wand pointed directly at them. She smiled. It was a nasty smile; cruel and smirking.

"What the…?" muttered Ron under his breath.

"You're all going to slowly put your wands on the floor." Hannah said tersely. "NOW!"

Neville tried to see an opening but he couldn't. He put his cherished wand on the floor. The rest all quietly obeyed.

Hannah smiled again. "There. That wasn't so hard, was it?" she said mockingly.

Neville swallowed hard. "Crouch?" He asked roughly.

"Seriously?!" Ron spluttered. "I was right? She's Crouch? I mean, he's her?!"

But Hannah was shaking her head. "I'm not Barty."

"Barty." Draco repeated dryly. "You sound like you know him well."

"He's my lover." Hannah said simply.

"For how long?" asked Blaise.

"Since the Summer, right?" guessed Theo before Hannah could answer. The Slytherin had his usual 'I've worked this out' look on his face.

"Uncle Amos brought Mister Crouch round for dinner just before the World Cup." Hannah agreed. "Only it wasn't him but Barty. He says it was love at first sight for him." She sighed, giddiness written across her beaming face. "He left me love notes for months and his elf would pick up my messages to him in return…"

No doubt the same damn elf that had left the threat in Neville's home for Harry. Anger stirred in Neville's belly. Hannah had been giving Crouch information all year – which meant…

"The Yule Ball." Neville snapped out, interrupting Hannah's ramble on Barty's romancing of her. "You set me up to get kidnapped."

Hannah glared at him. "He just wanted to talk to you and you threw it in his face!"

"His perverted colleague tried to kill me!" Neville yelled back. "Do you get that?! If it hadn't been for Sirius…"

"Black is a maniac!" Hannah retorted. "He's evil! He's turned the entire world against Barty…"

"Because Crouch is sociopathic criminal!" Neville retorted. "He's trying to kill us all! And you? He's just using you!"

"He's not using me!" Hannah said a touch hysterically.

Behind her the panel slid open noiselessly.

A figure stepped out and raised a finger to her lips.

Neville kept his focus on Hannah. "He is."

"He's not."

There was a nearby vase – heavy and ornamental. The figure levitated it with surprising ease.

Neville knew he had to keep Hannah's attention on him. "He is using you! He's using you to do his dirty work!"

"He's not!" Hannah said again. "Take it back! You take it back!"

She went to take a step forward and the vase dropped on her head. She went down like a tonne of bricks.

"Take that, you bitch!" Sue Bones said fiercely, and then she burst into tears.

Neville picked up his wand and a moment later Hannah was bound in ropes and stunned for good measure. The others grabbed their wands; Fred handing Natalie and Luna theirs – they were trying to console a crying Sue.

"Sue," Neville said seriously, "thank you."

Sue nodded. "She stunned the Creevey brothers on the stairs and then…she must have stunned me. I came to in a broom closet! Luckily Aunty Amelia taught me a few tricks and Hannah," her voice broke on the name, "*she* was stupid enough to leave my wand so I could get free." She swiped at her face. "I'm so angry! She betrayed us!" She said. "She betrayed us all!"

"She did." Neville agreed. "But now we have to get you guys to the office and do the spell. Don't let her win."

Sue nodded. "Where's Ced?"

"Ced…" Ron blanched under his freckles and the office group exchanged looks of concern.

Neville sent a questioning look to Blaise who shrugged; he didn't know what was up either.

"Cedric didn't make it." Natalie said softly. "We were attacked – he saved Viktor's life and gave his own."

Sue's face crumpled again but suddenly she shook off her upset, determination written in every line of her body. "Then I'll finish what he started. Let's do this!"

"What do we do with Abbott?" asked Blaise.

"Bring her." Natalie ordered.

"Right-o!" chorused Fred and George. They levitated Hannah's stunned form between them.

They all set off up the corridor but they'd barely taken four steps when a spell came from behind them.

It missed, taking out the bust of former Headmaster Dippet and they all ducked.

Neville's eyes narrowed at the sight of the Death Eater and the group of stalking vampires and mercenaries just behind him. "Get to the office and raise the defences! NOW!"

"GO!" Natalie ordered. "We'll cover you! GO!"

Fred looked at George.

"I'll take her." George agreed as though they'd had a conversation. "Just…"

"Don't get dead." Fred grinned back at him and ducked again as another spell impacted the wall beside them. "GO!"

"Come on!" Draco pushed Ron up the corridor, Sue and Luna running ahead of them. George followed with Hannah.

"Cover!" Neville called out.

Theo came to stand at Neville's left shoulder; Blaise was at his right. Natalie and Fred took flanking positions either side. They fired back providing the cover for the others; shielding each other.

The Death Eater finally held up a hand and everything stopped for a moment. He unmasked.

"Carrow." Neville said identifying the pock-faced man immediately from the old photos he'd been shown.

"Longbottom." Carrow grinned hideously. "Do you honestly think your rag-tag group of students will last long against us? Do the right thing and surrender!"

Neville glanced around the rest of the group, around his friends.

Blaise grinned back at him. "Looks like I'm joining you in reckless Gryffindor acts, Nev."

"Hey," Fred commented almost cheerfully except for the strain in his voice, "I resemble that!"

Theo snorted. "I'm making a perfectly well-informed Slytherin choice."

Natalie smiled sadly. A silent 'we're with you' in her eyes.

Neville turned back to Carrow. "My parents defied Tom Riddle three times. If they can do that; I can defy *you*, a mere servant of his, this one time."

Carrow's eyes narrowed with anger. "Then so be it." He flicked his wand toward them –

Neville shielded them immediately from the corrosive acid spell –

And the vampires attacked.

o-O-o

"SIRIUS!" Harry almost didn't duck Voldemort's spell in time but he made it, rolled and came up swinging with one of his own.

But his mind was on Sirius. From the glimpse he'd caught – Bartemius Crouch Junior holding Sirius at wand-point and raising –

he dodged another spell –

and raising the tournament cup.

The cup that was a portkey between Hogwarts and the cemetery.

Harry sent back a blasting spell but it aimed it at the gravestone next to Voldemort. The stone exploded sending shrapnel everywhere.

Voldemort hurriedly shielded.

There was no guarantee that the cup led back to Hogwarts.

But it was a good bet.

So all Harry had to do was defeat a Dark Lord and get to Hogwarts to save Sirius.

A Hogwarts which would have its ancient defences raised.

Although not yet if Crouch had managed to yank Sirius there.

Voldemort sent another spell in Harry's direction and he batted it away. He sent a volley of rocks and dirt back at Voldemort.

There was a window of opportunity then.

But Harry needed some way into Hogwarts.

He frowned and dropped to avoid a deadly yellow curse.

He'd managed to send all his friends back to Hogwarts from Saint Mungo's; when Harry had thought Sirius was dead and had just needed them to be safe.

He just needed to do that again; send himself and everyone to Hogwarts.

But in a controlled way.

He fingered the Elder wand speculatively.

o-O-o

Remus had cornered Peter by the edge of the churchyard.

Wormtail had tried to change into his animagus form but he hadn't practiced for his new metallic hand and the transformation had failed.

Remus stalked Peter as he backed up against a low wall.

"Please, Moony…"

Remus sent a stinging hex at the snivelling wizard who shielded against it only at the last minute, fumbling with his wand. "Don't call me that! You lost all rights to call me that!"

"I'm…" Peter shook his head, "I'm sorry."

"Sorry?!" Remus snarled, his wolf surging to the fore. "Sorry was last year, Peter. Sorry was when all you had on your conscience was spying on us! Sorry was before you betrayed James and Lily! Before you murdered people and had Sirius locked up for your crimes!"

"I was scared…"

"You were weak." Remus continued to stalk him down the length of the wall. "You ARE weak."

"I'm on your side!" Peter said, shielding again against another stinging hex.

"You're on your own side!"

"I sent you the letter warning you about Greyback!" Peter exclaimed almost babbling in his urgency to get the words out. "I sent you the letter warning you your wife and child were targeted!"

"And you did that with your master's blessing!" Remus countered.

"Please, Remus!" Peter grovelled again. "Please!"

A dark shape peeled away from the shadow of the wall and loomed up behind Peter.

Peter gave a horrified cry and curled up in a ball, wails of agony spilling from his lips as the Dementor descended upon him.

Remus froze.

He didn't need to do anything.

The Dementor would Kiss the rat and wasn't that justice?

He'd thought of nothing but putting down the rat for hours but…

But that had been when his mind had conjured up images of Peter fighting him; raising a wand against him. Not this cowardly, quivering sobbing mess that reminded Remus far too much of the shy and timid boy he'd befriended years before.

He couldn't help but remember Harry in the Shrieking Shack talking Remus and Sirius out of murder; telling them his parents, that James wouldn't have wanted that. Remus hesitated to just walk away…what would he tell Harry?

"Remus!" Peter shrieked weakly. "Help me! Please, please! I beg you!"

Remus grimaced. He lifted his wand…

o-O-o

Bill kept quiet.

Hedwig and Caro in her animal form were doing a marvellous job of herding the snake towards his position.

The position he'd been in for hours. It had been hell.

Hell when the Fidelius had kicked in and he'd lost focus; his memory and mind confused. Luckily he'd tied himself to the tree and left himself a note telling himself to remain tied to the tree no matter what because their target was the snake.

He had heard her slithering past his hiding place a few times. He had cast scent-neutralising spells and warded the tree against predators but he had no way of knowing whether that would have been enough to keep her away until he was in a position to kill her.

Because he'd barely been coherent with the Fidelius; barely made out when he'd heard voices because the Fidelius had acted there too – muffling the sound into vague murmurs. It hadn't been until he'd heard Snape's voice suddenly; crisp and loud and speaking the secret.

Then, the world had jumped back into focus.

He'd quickly untied himself and scrambled out of his hiding place in the hollow tree to join the fight, to find and eliminate the final likely horcrux of the snake.

She was angry now, hissing and spitting venom at the two birds as they dive-bombed and harried her away from the main fighting to the darkened corner where Bill was waiting.

They almost had her…

"Come on, little snakey," Bill whispered, "come on…"

o-O-o

Ron yelled the password at the gargoyle which moved aside with surprising speed. A moment later they were all running up the stairs and into the Headmaster's office.

George shut the door behind them and locked it for good measure. He set Hannah down in a corner.

They stooped and pulled back the heavy rug in front of the Headmaster's desk. The plain wooden floor underneath had a faded crest painted upon; the crest of Hogwarts.

Ron stood immediately on the Gryffindor part; Draco took a breath and joined him. A moment later Sue was on the Hufflepuff and Luna had completed the four joining them on the Ravenclaw.

They pointed their wands to the centre so all four were touching.

Ron looked around the group. "Ready?"

Draco gave a decisive nod. "Ready."

Sue nodded.

Luna smiled at him. "It's time."

"We all remember what to do?" Ron asked anxiously. "Sue?"

"I'll be fine." Sue said firmly.

"For Merlin's sake, let's just get on with it, Weasley!" Draco snapped.

Ron raised his hand and counted down with his fingers; three, two, one…

"Magicae vocationem nostrum, alumni audire vocem tuam!" They said together in harmony.

"In nomine Gryffindor, mandabo draconi excitare!" Ron said loudly.

Sue cleared her throat. "In nomine Hufflepuff, mandabo draconi excitare!"

"In nomine Slytherin, mandabo draconi excitare!" Draco intoned, his voice shaking.

"In nomine Ravenclaw, mandabo draconi excitare!" Luna completed.

"Draco surge et defendere castellum!" They all said together.

There was a grinding sound and the wall behind the Headmaster's desk disappeared to reveal another stone wall almost completely covered with a painting – a picture of a ginormous dragon sleeping.

"Well," George remarked dryly, "you don't see that every day."

"Look!" Luna pointed with satisfaction. "It's waking up!"

o-O-o

Sirius might have been taken by surprise by Crouch's portkey move but he hadn't been a hit wizard for nothing. He nailed the landing while Crouch stumbled. Sirius sent a stinging hex at the madman and was free, and in a fighting stance in a second.

He barely paid attention to the fact that they had landed on the platform where the Champion would have ended up, but he couldn't miss the exchange of spell fire nearby where Moody and another wizard were engaged in battle. He pushed them out of his mind; he needed to focus on his own fight…

He shielded immediately as Crouch went on the offensive.

Sirius countered every spell looking for his own opportunity to attack.

He needed to get back to the cemetery; he needed to get back to Harry…

o-O-o

Harry knew he needed Voldemort distracted. He switched in a quick move to his holly wand and thrust it out in front of him. He knew it didn't matter what spell he used…

"Expelliarmus!" He shouted as Voldemort let loose another bone-breaking curse.

The spells collided in the space between them and the wands connected.

Instantly there was a golden dome surrounding them cutting them off from the rest of the graveyard. Phoenix song filled the air; lifting Harry's spirit.

Voldemort's red eyes were wide with shock.

Harry saw the bead of light where the wands connected and willed it into Voldemort's wand. It moved slowly but surely towards Voldemort.

Voldemort regained himself. His face contorted into a mask of determination and Harry felt when he started to push back.

But Harry had the advantage and he wasn't letting it go. He gritted his teeth and pushed with everything he had.

The bead suddenly zipped down the spell beam and smacked into the end of Voldemort's wand.

Immediately a smokey shadowy figure of the cowering Avery emerged. "He killed me!"

"Lord Potter." Nott was the next and he gave Harry a proud nod. "Tell Theo I died bravely."

An old muggle man emerged. "Killed me he did!" The man declared. "You hold on, lad!"

A woman next who cried and sobbed out her distress.

A small boy; giggling and babbling – the baby Voldemort had possessed.

And then…

His mother.

Harry's heart pounded at the sight of her but he'd seen her before; seen the spirit of her guarding and protecting him in the family magic; seen and spoken with her ghost in another cemetery. He knew what he was looking at was nothing more than afterimage – like a portrait or a picture.

"Hold on, Harry!" His mother said warmly. "Your Dad's coming."

And he was.

His Dad emerged from the wand and drifted over to Harry as more figures continued to spill out the wand.

"Break the connection and use the stone!" His Dad said urgently. "For a moment we'll be real again and can distract him while you make your move!"

Harry nodded. He slashed his wand down…

The dome and song disappeared…

The stone was in his hand and the wand images became corporeal – a mass of the dead surrounding Voldemort…

Harry pointed the Elder wand at the ground. "PORTUS MAXIMUS HOGWARTS!"
