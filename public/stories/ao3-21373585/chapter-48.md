**(** **Kamino Ward Police Station** **)**

  
  
  

“Uh…You think they’re busy?”

Izuku chuckled a little as the three teens looked up at the Kamino Ward Police Station, which had a delivery truck broken through the wall and sticking out of the second floor; most likely thrown by the massive tornado All Might had caused. They were around the corner of an alley, the couple wanting to keep their distance so as to not be seen on any cameras out front. “I think they can squeeze Kacchan in. Okay, Kacch-”

Izuku cut himself off, seeing Katsuki had already begun walking ahead, hands in pockets and silent. That was more or less the demeanor he kept on the entire walk over. They were all quiet, the night fully setting in. They had been out all night, the dawn barely breaking. 

Both Izuku and Kyouka’s phones were completely blown up with text messages, both from all of their friends and their parents. Their friends were just talking about how insane the fight was, who All For One was and how All Might could fly being the main topics.

Their parents, however? 

…Yeah, they figured out a long time ago that they weren’t at the beach.

…AAAnd all three parents were less than happy that they were lied to, don’t know where their children are, and that they still haven’t responded.

At this point, they really just didn’t want to pull that trigger just yet. 

And, one text from Gran Torino…they left that unread, not even wanting to face that right now.

They let Katsuki go, deciding not to push him. They had to remember he was just kidnapped, so things probably weren’t easy for him right now.

Although, Kyouka was finding it a little hard to really care right now.

She empathized, she did, but…she was just done with that asshole. He had a busted lip as evidence.

Katsuki stopped, turning around to look at the couple. His expression was blank, and it took him a second to properly create the words, but eventually he nodded at them. 

“...Thanks. For coming for me, I mean.”

Izuku smiled just a little, nodding his head back, “Anytime.”

He turned to Kyouka, and the silence returned tenfold. How she hated him more than Izuku, she’ll never fully understand. That boy was just too pure, almost to a fault. But, she was aware that she slipped earlier; Izuku was right, it certainly wasn’t the time to go after him for past bullshit. It probably wouldn’t be that way for a long time, if ever. No matter how awful said past bullshit is. 

She just nodded her head in return, an answer that Katsuki was more than okay with. 

He began his trek to the police station, leaving his saviors behind. 

Kyouka crossed her arms, leaning against the wall, “You think he’ll drop it? Everything he heard, that is.”

“For now, yeah. Even if he didn’t, we don’t have time to worry about it now. We gotta get home and face the Wrath of the Parents. After that? I think we have a lot to talk about.”

“Biggest understatement of the year.”

  
  
  
  

***…~AMP~...***

  
  
  
  

**(** **Kamino Ward General Hospital** **)**

  
  

“...So, are we gonna talk about it, or are you just gonna continue to sulk in the corner?”

Torino turned away from the window, an unamused glare directed Toshinori, “I’m convinced Jirou has done irreparable damage to your attitude.” 

“Don’t tell her that. She’ll be so proud of herself.”

With a roll of his eyes, Torino turned back to the window, “What is there to talk about at this point? We lost the battle before we even arrived. Kotaro’s dead, and now his son is All For One’s successor.”

“Let’s be honest, something deep down was telling us Kotaro was gone. I saw the family picture at All For One’s old cabin. I’ve been a Pro for thirty years, Kotaro knew I was All Might, he had to. He never even thought to try and get back in contact with us.”

Tsukauchi leaned against the nightstand next to Toshinori’s bed, shrugging his shoulders, “I don’t know much about the whole family dynamic you guys had, but to be fair, he might’ve been pretty pissed that he got left behind. Besides, you went to America for years, and Torino here isn’t exactly easy to both find and/or get a hold of. We should take everything All For One says with a grain of salt.”

“He was my little brother in everything but blood…and name, but still. All For One wouldn’t lie about this. Kotaro being dead would cause him far more pleasure than just lying to us about it. But, we haven’t lost yet. His son is alive. Shigaraki is my nephew, I have to find him and save him.”

“You need to get that idea out of your head, Toshinori,” Torino sighed. “He’s not your nephew. You can’t simply ignore the fact that he’s not only a criminal, but he’s All For One’s protege who *hates you* . And, according to All For One, he hated you before he was ever even taken in and indoctrinated. Whatever family ties you hope to create aren’t there, and most assuredly aren’t reciprocated. What you need to do is focus on UA, do what needs to be done. Finding Shigaraki will fall to Tsukauchi and I.”

“But-!”

*\*Bzzzt!\**   *\*Bzzzt!\**

The conversation was cut off as Tsukauchi’s phone buzzed in his pocket. He sighed, grumbling about his phone going off all day as he picked it up. “Detective Tsukauchi. Yeah? No, I-...What? Uh, yeah. Yeah, I’ll be right there.”

Torino looked over at Tsukauchi, a brow raised, “Something wrong?”

“Yeah, I-...I mean, no, it…It’s the Bakugou kid. He just showed up at the local police station. I gotta go. Torino, I’ll call you whenever the investigation can get started.” They waved to him as he rushed out of the room, off to finally relieve the stress of the Bakugou family.

 “Those kids actually did it,” Torino scoffed. “If it wasn’t for Hosu, I wouldnt believe it.”

“Never had a doubt in my mind,” Toshinori smiled, sitting up in bed. “They were with Shigaraki for a long time. Perhaps they know something of his whearabouts.”

Torino turned back to him, a look of warning on his face, “And if they do, *I’ll* ask them. Not that you’re in any condition for going rogue, even if you wanted to, but I was serious. Leave Shigaraki to us.”

“Torino, I saw her last night. I had my own echo of Nana appear, just like Young Midoriya. She gifted me her quirk for that fight, something we desparately need to discuss with Young Midoriya about. But, seeing her again, it…it was everything. I can’t just leave the last of her family like this.”

“ *We’re* the last of her family, Toshinori.”

“You just want to go after Shigaraki because you blame yourself for all of this.”

“No, I-...I…” Torino scowled at the floor, a sigh escaping his lips as he restd his chin against his cane. “I’m the one that convinced her to send Kotaro away.”

“Correction: Nana *asked you* to convince her to send Kotaro away. It was her idea, but she couldn’t go through with it. She told you to convince her, because she didn’t have the strength to do it alone.”

“Is that suppose to make me feel better?”

“Yes, actually. It wasn’t your fault, at least not nearly as much as you think it was. It wasn’t Nana’s fault either; she was absolutely terrified and still grieving over Yori. We all were. Blame the bastard we just put away last night, and end the discussion there.” Torino was silent after that, most likely refusing to see it the way Toshinori did. He couldn’t blame him, though. Toshinori knew self-blame, and it’s iron grip. “Look, just…I gotta clear my head.” 

“You need to rest.”

Toshinori shook his head as he got out of bed, “My legs aren’t broken.”

He walked out of the room, breathing in the fresh air. Or, well, about as fresh as a hospital hallway could be. It at least smelled clean. He began to walk down the hall, finding a nurse exiting one of the rooms. She caught his eyes, almost dropping her clipboard at the sight of him, “O-Oh my-! All Might! H-Hi, I’m such a big fa— Um, I mean, thank you for saving the city last night. Truly. My sister was at the shopping disctrict before it all went down.”

Toshinori waved it off, smiling politely, “Of course, ma’am. I’m just happy she’s alright. But, if you could help me? I’m looking for Mt. Lady’s room.”

“Oh, of course! I believe she’s just over there in six-ninety-four.”

Toshinori bowed, thanking her as he walked by, doing his best to not mention her starstruck gaze. Once he made it to the door, and the nurse had finally snapped out of it and left to go back to her work, Toshinori raised his hand to knock on the door. Except, it opened up before he could.

…With Midnight on the other side?

“Wh-? Kayama?” 

Nemuri stood frozen in her casual attire; a black off-shoulder sweater and black jeans. Her eyes went wide at the sight of her coworker, “Uh…”

“I thought you were in Martinique on vacation?”

She snapped out of it, clearing her throat as she tried to return to a casual position, “I-I was. I flew back this morning after I saw what happened. Are you okay?”

“Ah, I'll live. You already know it’s far from the worst beating I’ve taken. But, don't worry about me, I'm sure there are plenty of people who need help around here, or back at City Center. Is Mt. Lady doing okay?”

“She’s sleeping, but she'll be fine.”

“Thank goodness. I keep thinking that I could've prevented the attack on her. Nice of you to visit her, especially with how you two don't seem to get along on TV.”

Nemuri’s eyes shifted a bit, “...Yeah.”

“You know, the funny thing is, she mentioned back before the raid that she was supposed to be going on vacation before being called in for the rescue operation. Martinique too. What a coincidence, right?”

“Um…”

“Yeah, I mean, what are the odds of— Oh my God.”

“Wh-?! Jus-! Shush!” Midnight looked around the hall, eternally grateful that nobody was around. She turned back to All Might, an uncharacteristic blush on her face. Well, a blush that was related to embarrassment and not other things. 

“Sorry! Sorry, I-I just-? I mean, I gotta admit you both had me completely fooled. Probably everyone! Congratulations, really. That’s wonderful.”

“I…Thank you,” Midnight sighed, but had a small smile on her lips. “Listen, can you keep this to yourself, please? There’s a reason we keep the act up. Having a private life is already difficult enough as it is.”

“Oh, of course! This is me we’re talking about. Almost nobody even knows my real name, you already know how much I value privacy. I mean, I don’t keep up much with the hero gossip and all, but I have to assume it’s already hard enough with the rumors with Kamui Woods and all.”

“Oh, those,” Kayama chuckled. “He was Yuu’s friend before we met. He’s been helping us. The rumors are insurance, so to speak.”

“Hmhmhm, clever. Well, then as far as anyone is concerned, I was never here.”

“Thank you, All Might. And…” Midnight smiled, reaching up and pecking Toshinori on the cheek. “My thanks aren’t just for this, they’re for everything. Sometimes it’s hard to remember just who you are, when most of the time when I see you it’s just as my friend. Everyone, myself and Sleeping Beauty back there, wouldn’t be here if not for you. Not just last night, but I’m sure countless times over the last thirty years.”

“Bah, are you kidding? The whole reason I came here is because Mt. Lady is the one who broke the villain's breathing mask. She was a bigger help than she knows. You’ve got a real hero on your hands.”

“Ah, well, we’re still working on her vanity, but…Thank you. I’ll be sure to tell her you said that.”

All Might nodded, waving goodbye, “I’ll see you at school.”

“Ugh,” Kayama groaned, “Work is the last thing I want to think about right now.”

“Hehe! Hey, if you two want to hop back on another plane to Martinique, I’ll cover for you.”

“I appreciate it, but Yu’s quirk is far too useful for the clean-up. We’ve got time, though. Summer’s not over yet.”

All Might suddenly felt his phone buzz in his pocket. He pulled it out, finding a text from Izuku.

\[Y. Midoriya\]: **…We really need to talk.**

“...It certainly is not.”

  
  
  
  

***…~AMP~...***

  
  

**(** **Trainline: Kamino to Musutafu** **)**

  
  

This was definitely the emptiest Izuku had ever seen a traincar. He and Kyouka were completely alone.

Most were probably staying home, being with their loved ones, mourning those caught in the crossfire. All Might evacuating the area had to have saved hundreds, or even thousands, but All For One still found a way. They were still counting the death toll. Last time he had checked the news on his phone, they were over four-hundred and going up. 

He couldn’t focus on that now. There was nothing else he could do now except get back to his mission, and do his best to make sure something like this never happened again.

“Do you think I’m worth it?”

Izuku was shaken from his thoughts, turning to look at Kyouka, “What?”

“One For All. I mean…Look, we both know what All Might’s message meant. But, he doesn’t know about me yet. I don’t even know how we’re gonna tell him tonight. I…I’m a part of this now; of *that message.* And, please, don’t give me the boyfriend answer. I’m dead serious, do you think I can do this?”

“...Complete transparency?” Izuku took her hand, looking her dead in the eye. “Kyouka, I don’t even know if *I* can do this, and I agreed to it a long time ago. It’s not a question I can answer for you. Do I believe in you? Of course I do, one-hundred percent. But, what I think doesn’t really matter. What’s been put on our shoulders now, it…it’s a lot. It’s everything. Whether or not you’re up to the task is a question only you can answer for yourself, just as it is for me. All we can do is try. We have each other, though; which is far more than All Might or any past user could say. With you by my side…I like our odds.”

“I like our odds too,” Kyouka grinned, bringing their joined hands together and kissing his knuckles. She leaned her head against his shoulder, her eyes locked on their hands. Her mind flashed back to Izuku taking her hand when she saw All For One for the first time. She wasn’t sure if she was grateful or not to finally have a face (or lack thereof) to place on some of her nightmares. But, he was in Tartarus now, in what seemed to be critical condition. 

Tomura, however…

What was all that? Why did he care so much about Izuku’s past? Sure, he was trying to make his point about the shitty parts of society, but what did he care? All he’s ever caused was chaos and destruction, and yet he claimed to not even want that. She didn’t want to believe him, but she couldn’t find a lie all night.

Hell, he even kept his word about Bakugou.

…Bakugou.

The boiling underneath her skin came back at the thought of him. She was surprised the fucker even bothered to thank them for coming after him. She knew Izuku wasn’t gonna want to talk about most of what they saw at Aldera. And, to be fair, they did have more important things at hand.

But, they would discuss a lot of things with All Might. This was the time for anything he wanted to get off his chest now that he was alone with her.

And, one question had been ringing around in her head ever since Tomura brought it up.

“Izuku…Why did you go up to the roof so many times?”

Izuku sat motionless in his seat, the city going by him out through the train window. He didn’t emote, simply shaking his head just slightly, “Nothing. I needed somewhere to be alone at school. No one laughing at me, mocking me, calling me worthless. I just needed somewhere nobody else would be.”

Kyouka nodded, but her expression clearly showed Izuku she wasn’t satisfied, “And…?”

“...I'm not ready for that conversation. Honestly, I don't think you are either. I've intentionally forgotten most of it.”

“...Okay.” Kyouka leaned up, kissing his temple. “Whenever you're ready, I'll be here.”

“I know, and I will be. We just have so much to focus on right now. So much of my past doesn't matter now, not when compared to tonight.” 

“I understand,” Kyouka nodded, hugging his arm. “If it makes you feel any less alone, I haven’t shared everything about myself either. Obviously I don't compare, and I'm just talking about trivial matters an-”

“A wise, stunning woman once told me everyone's problems are their own, and are significant to them in their own ways. She also helped me understand that bottling up doesn't need to be solved by letting things out all at once. She's always there for me whenever I'm ready to let out and look at another part of me. I hope she realizes by now that I'm here to do the same for her.”

“She does. And, she loves you.”

Izuku smiled, kissing Kyouka and resting his cheek on her head as she hugged his arm. “I love her too.”

  
  
  
  

***…~AMP~...***

  
  
  

**(** **Two Hours Later: Outside of Jirou Household** **)**

  
  
  

“...We’re screwed, right?”

Izuku nodded as they both stood unmoving outside of Kyouka’s house, just in front of the porch steps. “If we lie? Yeah, we are. But, after everything that’s happened, I think it’s time we started telling them the truth. I should’ve told my mom a long time ago, and I don’t want you to make the same mistake with your parents.”

“...I feel like we should wait to explain that part until we’re with the others.”

“It’d probably be better, true. I don’t know if they’ll be willing to wait that long, though…Wait a minute. I feel like your mom should probably be hearing all thi—” The front door suddenly swung open, revealing both Jirous and Inko on the other side; all looking less than happy. “...Welp.”

“Izuku!” Inko ran out, engulfing her son in a bear hug, tears in her eyes. Kyouka sighed in relief that her bones weren’t being crushed, but was quickly grabbed by Inko anyway. “Where were you two?!”

“U-Uh, well…” / “It’s a little complicated.” Izuku and Kyouka replied respectively. 

After she let them down, Kyoutoku and Mika hugged them both as well. But, Kyoutoku stepped back, his eyes darting between the two teenagers, “What the Hell is wrong with you two? After what happened at camp, you think it’s a good idea to go sneaking off on your own? You two weren’t at the beach, were you? Have you even seen the new-”

“We rescued Kacchan,” Izuku bluntly cut them off, silencing him on the spot.

Kyoutoku and Mika both merely looked confused, not recognizing the nickname Izuku used. 

Inko, however…

“...You what?!” Inko stood utterly shellshocked at what her son had said, hardly fathoming what she was hearing. 

“We were there. A-At Kamino, I mean. Or, well, first we went to Aldera, but we were teleported to Kamino.”

“...” / “...” / “...”

Kyouka stepped in, a hand on Izuku’s shoulder as she looked at her parents, “Kacchan is what Izuku calls Bakugou. Like I said, it’s a little complicated. If you don’t believe us, you might wanna step inside and look back at the TV.”

Kyoutoku’s eyes darted back and forth between the teens before he went back into the house, looking at the TV to see what his daughter had heard. 

*~”Breaking News! The young man that was kidnapped by the League of Villains, Katsuki Bakugou, who was not found at the villain’s hideout last night, randomly appeared at the Kamino Ward Police Station this morning. He was mostly unscathed, all except for a bruised lip. His appea-”~*

Kyoutoku turned back around, stepping through the door and looking down at the teens with incredulity, “...What the Hell did you two do?”

“Second question,” Inko cut in, turning the attention to her son. “Izuku…Who is Mr. Yagi? Outside of being All Might, that is.”

The couple looked at one another, both knowing this had been coming. “...You wanna meet him?”

  
  
  

***…~AMP~...***

  
  
  
  

**(** **Many Hours Later: Dagobah Municipal Beach Park** **)**

  
  

Toshinori felt the ocean breeze wash over him as the sun fully went down over the horizon line. He was discharged from the hospital a few hours ago, thankful to be out of that place. He always hated hospitals. 

He sat back on the stairs leading to the sand, awaiting the arrival of his students. Despite standing up for them against Torino, he was fighting himself on whether to be happy they were safe, well, and successful in their mission, or to be absolutely pissed that they would go do something so reckless. 

Eh, he’d probably do a little bit of both. Safest option.

“All Might!” 

Toshinori turned around, seeing the couple run towards him from the road leading back to town. “There you two are!”

As they got there, Izuku smiled brightly as he rushed to his mentor, “All Mig-Huah!” 

Izuku was suddenly yanked off the ground as he was lifted up by the collar of his shirt, Toshinori’s eyes piercing through his soul.

“WHAT THE HELL IS WRONG WITH YOU TWO?!?!?!” He dropped Izuku back on the ground, pacing back and forth in front of them as he struggled to find the proper words. “Why?! Just—Just-?! Why?! And you!”

Kyouka flinched back as All Might’s attention swerved to her, “Uh-”

“Isn’t it your self-appointed job to stop his recklessness?!”

“I think we’ve established I’m pretty bad at that part of the job. And, to be fair to me, I *did* convince him to not go after Bakugou at the bar before the Raid even started…even though we…k-kinda did that anyway. Hm…”

“Hey, in our defense, we didn’t have much of a choice!” Izuku said as he smoothed out his shirt. “Shigiraki left us a note at the hospital telling us to come talk to him, and we’d get Kacchan back. I-I know we couldn’t trust him, but do you think he would’ve just let him go if we didn’t?”

“Well-! I-...Okay, that’s actually a fair defense. Look, just…” Toshinori sighed, not having the energy to keep his tirade going. He knelt down, extending his non-casted arm out to them. “Come here.”

They glanced at one another, but stepped forward. He took them both in his embrace, his head resting between the couple on their touching shoulders, “I’m just so glad you’re both alright. I was scared outta my mind about you two the whole time.”

They both sighed in relief, not that they didn’t think they deserved to be chewed out a little. They hugged him back, with Kyouka replying, “We were scared about you too.”

Toshinori tried to pull away, but Izuku’s arms remained locked tight. He heard Izuku sniff quietly, just once. Like before, he was trying to force himself not to cry. It seemed that he took his comments about Izuku being a crybaby back when they first met to heart. He never meant it like that. “Young Midoriya?”

“...I wasn’t sure you’d come back.”

Toshinori smiled, hugging a little tighter, “I’m not going anywhere, kid.”

He pulled away, grabbing Izuku’s arm as the teen tried to quickly wipe away stray tears. He looked up at his mentor confused, freezing as he saw a couple tears in All Might’s eyes, a smile on his face. Izuku smiled back, taking a deep breath as he let his own tears fall.

“A Couple of babies.” They turned to Kyouka, seeing two full streams of tears run down her face. “Crying like that.”

“Jesus, to Hell with All For One. You two are gonna be the death of me.” Toshinori pulled back, ruffling both of their heads. He stepped down onto the sand as Izuku wiped Kyouka’s eyes, looking back out towards the ocean. “You were right, we need to talk. I hope you were watching the news after the battle ended.”

Izuku sighed, but nodded, “We were. And…I saw.”

Toshinori nodded, buffing himself up with a grunt. He threw a couple punches before sighing deeply, returning his body back to normal. He wiped his lip, finding a drop of blood on his fingertips, “I can’t hold my hero form anymore, at least not for more than a few minutes at best. Even then, my strength is gone. The embers of One For All finally ran out. All Might is over. I officially retire tomorrow morning. I’ll admit, even though I was more than happy to give you One For All, it’s a day I’ve been dreading for years. All Might was my entire life, my dream. Even with everything it cost me personally, I never wanted to stop. But, I don’t think I could’ve asked for a better ending, nor could I have asked for a better person to continue on after me. You wanna know something crazy?”

Izuku chuckled nervously, “We were gonna ask you the same thing.”

“Oh, I’m sure. I’m excited to hear this ‘game-changing news’ you alluded to yesterday. But, yesterday, Nana appeared to me. Not your Nana, but a fragment of her. She would’ve turned into your Nana if I hadn’t passed One For All on.” 

“...Float,” Izuku murmured, so deep in thought that he was basically saying it to himself. “You were using her quirk.”

He turned back to his students, an almost bittersweet smile on his face, “Something I was hoping you and the real Nana could explain to me, because I’m still completely lost as to how I did any of that. But, really? I didn’t even care. Seeing her…I felt like a teenager again. It was like thirty years never passed. But, in the end, she told me I had done more than enough. I think that was all I needed to hear. My time was up…Our time. All Might may be over, but Toshinori Yagi is still kicking and has plenty of work to do. It’s your turn now, my boy. But, don’t think for a second I won’t be here every step of the way to forging your own path. Both of your paths, I should say.”

Izuku and Kyouka glanced at one another, neither wanting to start off the conversation. They were basically in a silent battle on who should speak first. Izuku eventually relented, turning back to All Might, “...That’s more fitting than you think.”

“...Oh dear God. What?”

 Izuku looked back at Kyouka, and she gave him a nervous nod. “...There’s something we gotta tell you.”

Toshinori groaned, “C’mon, kid, you couldn’t even give me twenty-four hours after the second fight of my life to have bad news for me?”

“I-It’s not *bad* news, per se. I’d definitely say it’s good news; very good news. It’s also just a little…complicated, to say the least.”

Toshinori peered at them cautiously, his eyes shifting between them, “Okay…”

“You see, in my fight with Muscular, I thought I was gonna die. So…I didn’t want One For All to end with me…”

“...Ooooh Sweet Jesus.” Toshinori’s eyes landed on Kyouka, who was trying and failing to turn invisible on the spot.

She eventually looked at Toshinori, nervously smiling as purple sparks flickered around her, “...Surprise?”

“...”

“...All Might?”

“...”

“Uh-oh.”

“...”

“Izuku, we broke him before we even got to the crazy part.”

Toshinori’s eyes then shifted back to Izuku, still not saying a word, silently asking for confirmation. Izuku shocked his head, lifting his hand up as cyan lighting crackled around his arm, “...She’s not kidding.”

  
  
  

***…~AMP~...***

  
  
  

**(** **One Crazy Explanation Later** **)**

  
  

All Might raised his head out of his hands, opening his mouth to speak. But, then he paused, shook his head, and then put his head back in his hands. 

On the stairs, Kyouka sat her arms on her knees, resting her head down upon them, “You’ve been doing that for the last twenty minutes.”

Toshinori waved his good arm around exasperatedly, “What am I supposed to say to this?! Any of it! I mean, I’m semi-joking when I say we can’t leave you two alone for twenty-four hours. But, I *literally* can’t leave you alone for twenty-four hours, or reality just starts making jokes.”

“Well, we…” Kyouka petered off and shrugged her shoulders, “I got no witty comeback. Everything you said was true.”

“Two people with One For All? I mean…Oh, God-damn it Gran Torino is gonna kill me. Your *parents* are gonna kill me!”

Izuku hummed to himself, “You know, I feel like you’re doing all the panicking I probably should have done way earlier.”

“Because what am I supposed to do with this?!” Toshinori stopped himself, and took a deep breath before focusing on his two students. “Okay. Okay, let me just…I dunno, go step-by-step with this. Alright, first of all, Young Midoriya. Good on you for having a back-up plan with One For All and acting on it in case the worst had happened. Young Jirou, thank you for saving him. So, now One For All has ‘awoken’, and has decided to reside in the two of you. And, now, we have to deal with this somehow. Starting with you, Young Jirou, obviously *cannot* use One For All at school.”

Kyouka nodded, “Yeah, I know. We’ve barely managed to lie our way through any of this up until now. Me suddenly having Izuku’s powers is impossible to fake our way through.”

“A-Actually, when it comes to school, I’ve been thinking about something. Kyouka and I talked about it, and now with this new situation, I think it’s something we really need to do. You said I can form my own Circle of Trust. You really mean I can decide who should know?”

“Of course,” Toshinori reassured him. “All I ask is that you never take your decision lightly. But, I trust you. Your quirk, your rules. Uh, that goes for both of you now, I guess.”

“...I think we should tell Mr. Aizawa.”

“I retract my previous statement.”

“Wh-What?! Why?”

Toshinori sighed, his head dropping to look at his feet, “Because Aizawa is never gonna let me live this down.”

Kyouka immediately raised her hand, “I second telling him. Outvoted two-to-one.”

All Might scowled at her, “Half of your reasoning is just to see him and I go at it.”

“Yep.”

“Wh-?! I just got out of the *second* fight of my life. Can you cut me some slack for like, ten minutes?”

Kyouka reached forward and patted All MIght’s arm, “I tease because I love ya, man.”

“How dare you throw wholesomeness at my heart right now. I’m still very panicked.”

“Well, I hate to make it worse—”

“No you don’t.”

“...But, we also promised both Inko and my parents an explanation…with you present…and we think Mr. Aizawa should be there too.”

“Jesus Christ, you’ve killed me.” All Might ran a hand through his hair, stunned into shock as he stared blankly at the sand, “I survived only for you two to kill me. I’m dead. I’m deader than dead.”

“You’ll be fine! We’ve got your back. Besides, we all gotta take our shifts with this stuff! Izuku and I just spent twelve hours dodging question after question, telling them to wait just a little longer. It was a miracle Izuku convinced them to let us leave the house again in the first place.”

Izuku’s brow furrowed as he turned to his girlfriend, “...I thought you were going to tell them we were leaving.”

“No, you-...Oh, c’mon.” Kyouka quickly pulled out her phone, finding multiple missed calls and texts from her parents. “God-damn it!”

“Jesus,” Toshinori sighed and pinched the bridge of his nose. “We need to put trackers on you both, ASAP.”

“For the love of all that’s holy, don’t give my mom ideas,” Izuku quickly shut him down as Kyouka tried her best to damage-control in the background via hurried texts. “Can you call Mr. Aizawa and give him Kyouka’s address?”

“WhoaWhoaWhoa! You guys want to do this *now?!”*

“All Might, there’s no way on Earth we’ll be able to fend off our parents any longer. If they don’t get an explanation soon, All For One will pale in comparison to what we’ll be up against.”

“That’s taking my dad out of the equation, by the way,” Kyouka added as she put her phone away. “You don’t want Mad Mika. We’re already on Simmering Mika.”

“Oh, I’m dead.” Toshinori continued to mutter to himself as he pulled out his phone, his heart dropping as he stared at Aizawa’s contact. “Has Nana said anything else about this?”

Izuku shook his head, a somber look on his face, “No. I’ve tried calling for her, but she won’t answer. She’s hidden back into One For All. She’s not taking the news very well.”

“She doesn’t like this happening?”

“N-No, it’s…it’s another thing, actually. Something you’re not gonna want to hear.”

“Lemme guess. Shigaraki is Nana’s grandson?”

Izuku and Kyouka both did a double-take, “You know?” / “You know?”

“All For One told me. And, you were right, I didn’t want to hear it. Shigaraki told you himself, huh?”

Kyouka nodded, leaning back on her arms, “Straight from his mouth. He seemed pretty happy to reveal it himself.”

“Damn it. I figured All For One was telling the truth, but I guess whatever sliver of hope I had that he was lying is now gone. Shit…” 

Izuku rested back against the stairs’ guardrail, his mind flashing back to Tomura’s smile as he told them. He didn’t think Tomura resembled Nana at all, right? Perhaps in the eyes, just a little. Izuku unfortunately also knew this was him trying to cope. “...What are we gonna do about him?”

“I…I don’t know,” Toshinori sighed, looking back out towards the water. “He’s my family. To me, at least. I’m sure he doesn’t feel the same. Torino isn’t sure he can be saved, told me to stay out of it.”

“Hm, it’s funny. He actually did call us a family. Said he and I were cousins, in a way.”

“What’s his deal with you two, anyway? All For One showed me footage of you guys at the school. Why would he even bother with all this?”

“He…He sort of tried to reason with us.”

“...What?”

“It’s hard to explain,” Izuku sighed, pacing around and kicking sand as he tried to break it down. “He claimed that he wanted to avoid us killing each other in the future. He wants us to think about everything he said, in hopes of joining together someday. We were at Aldera because he wanted to learn about me, my past. Unfortunately, he figured out more than I’d like. He said that…he understands me. He said stories like ours shouldn’t have to happen.”

“Bastard sort of tried with me, too.” Kyouka frowned up at the stars, thinking back to the rooftop as she shoved her hands into her jacket pockets. “Whenever something from Izuku’s past came up, it was like it was *my* buttons he was trying to push, not Izuku’s. He would talk to me directly, involve me in his little presentation. He wanted to piss me off, but not at him; at Bakugou and society. Even tried to talk about heteromorph discrimination.”

“Christ. But, I mean, this is good, right?” Toshinori looked back and forth between his students, a hopeful glint in his eyes. “He doesn’t want to kill you. He betrayed All For One, he has his own goals in mind. I mean, they’re probably bad…very bad, but still. He’s not his master; not pure evil. He wants something better, at least in some weird— probably still evil— way. There’s something good in him.”

“I hope so,” Izuku nodded. “But, we can’t just trust his word. He offered to murder Kacchan as revenge for me, just so I could get away with it. He still threatened to kill us if we refused him in the future, and even if he’s not his master, he was raised by him.”

“Let’s also not forget,” Kyouka cut in, looking back to Toshinori. “He wants to kill you.”

“I know, but…I…I can’t just-...”

Izuku nodded, “We know. We’ll do everything we can to get through to him. We’re just saying we have to be careful. What I don’t understand is if he knows Nana was his grandmother, *and* was a One For All holder, why is he with All For One? He’s gotta know All For One is responsible for her death, right?”

“Not sure he cares,” Kyouka shrugged. “Either that or he’s just been manipulated into thinking otherwise. But, there’s a good chance he’s playing both sides since he gave up All For One so easily.”

Toshinori sighed as he rubbed at his eye, finally clicking on Aizawa’s number, “Just put it aside for now. Torino’s on it. We’ll be here for hours, and we have bigger things to focus on. For instance, I’d like my grave plot next to Nana’s in Hosu.”

“Calm down. Inko and my dad aren’t gonna kill you.”

“...You left out your mother.”

“Alright, let’s go!” Kyouka ignored him, brushing herself off as she stood up. 

Toshinori deadpanned at her as the other end of the line clicked, Aizawa’s tired voice coming through, clearly having just been woken up, *“I told you that once we got Bakugou back I’d sleep for a week straight.”*

“Yeah, you’re gonna have to wait on that. I’m gonna send you an address, and you need to be there soon. Oh, and prepare for angry parents.”

*“...Shit.”*

**(** **Some Time Later: Outside of Jirou Household** **)**

  
  
  

Aizawa drank from another cup of coffee as he leaned against his car, steam rising out of the plastic lid as he looked up at the stars. He knew this was gonna be important, but couldn’t they have done this tomorrow morning? Or, even better, tomorrow afternoon? 

Although, he supposed he’d rather just get all the crazy shit done and over with, rather than spread this out further. 

Maybe he had time to take a power nap in his backsea— AAAnd there they were.

He turned to see a red truck approach, passing his car and pulling into the driveway. Shouta walked onto the sidewalk and towards the truck as Toshinori hopped out…

…and the Problem Children.

“I hope you two know just how badly I wish I could be surprised to see you here.”

Kyouka smiled nervously as she shut the door, “At least we’re entertaining?”

“Mm,” Shouta merely grunted in response. “Just tell me now: Am I in for some bullshit?”

“...Yeah.” / “...Yeah.” /  “...Yeah.” 

“...Of course.” Shouta sighed as the couple moved their way towards the front porch. He turned back to All Might, nodding in greetings to him, “You okay?”

“Eh, I’ve been through worse,” Toshinori shrugged. “Thank you for coming here on such short notice, and with no information.”

“You said some serious stuff was going to happen, both during and after that night. Speaking of which, the media's been going insane at both that villain and you…you know…flying. Have you always been able to do that, or…?”

“That was new, both to the world and to me. But, we’ll explain inside. Actually, to be fair, I don’t particularly know or understand how that happened, but…Ah, we’ll figure it out.” 

Shouta deadpanned at him as he walked inside, already knowing he wasn’t going to be even the slightest bit prepared for whatever was about to go down. He stepped inside, his gaze landing towards the living room to his right, and instantly realizing whose house he was in. It seemed both Problem Children took quite a bit after their respective mothers.

The attention switched to the front door, every parent standing up at the sight of their children. Kyoutoku was the first to speak up, “Would you two please stop disappear—Hoooly shit.”

Three pairs of eyes were fixated on All Might, and three jaws dropped. Toshinori cleared his throat, stepping out of the front foyer to bow, “It’s wonderful to meet you all…again.”

“I-I…Wow, I-...” Kyoutoku walked out of the living room, bowing deeply as he approached Toshinori. “Thank you. For everything! I mean, you know, interning my daughter, paying for her party, saving us all. I mean, if I knew you were All Might I-...You were in America when I was in middle school, my friends and I would run out to the nearest shop with TVs in the window just to see what you had done that day.”

“Oh my God,” Kyouka chuckled. “All that time trying to scare Izuku when you two had something in common all along.”

“Shush,” Mika eyed her daughter, bowing beside her husband. “Please, it’s an honor to have you in our home. And, you are?”

Aizawa stepped forward, bowing next to Toshinori, “Shouta Aizawa, the Proble-...Ahem, Midoriya and Jirou’s homeroom teacher. I was told to come here because apparently you’re not the only ones owed explanations tonight.”

Inko finally walked over, bowing to All Might with a blush and shaky voice, “It’s such an honor to meet you. It’s hard to believe I’m meeting you in person. I don’t think a day went by in our household where your name wasn’t said. Not to mention all the posters, toys, a—”

“Mom…” Izuku cleared his throat, a blush of his own. “Besides, you two have met.”

Toshinori and Inko both turned to Izuku, “We have?” / “We have?”

“The Musutafu HPSC building. Like, seventeen years go? You had him sign Dad’s poster.”

Inko perked up, her eyes going wide, “Oh! I almost forgot! Yes, I had you sign a poster an—…Wait, how do you know about that?”

“Er-! Uh, okay! Let’s all go to the living room. We’re in for a long evening!” Izuku sped-walked to the living room, leaving a facepalming Kyouka behind him. Everyone followed him, with the parents sitting back down on the couch, and Aizawa standing beside it with his arms crossed. Izuku stood before them all, with Kyouka near the TV behind him. “Okay, um…How should we start this?”

Kyouka shrugged, “Take the stage, babe. This one’s all you. You’re where the story starts. I’ll just sit back and await my cue.”

Izuku sighed as he turned back to the adults, all waiting on him to explain the near-unexplainable. 

“Mom, I know you’ve been wondering about my quirk for a long time now. And, even without all the stuff that happened between us, I just never really could think of how to properly tell you this, cause…It’s a lot. Far more than any of you can imagine. But, some things have happened recently that makes it to where I can’t keep this secret anymore…Or, well…” Izuku sighed as he motioned to Kyouka, “ *We* can’t keep this secret anymore.”

“You’re starting to scare us, kid,” Kyoutoku warily shifted in his seat on the couch. “I mean, c’mon. Surely it can’t be weirder than all the stuff that happened at Kamino, right? Or your camp?”

Izuku pursed his lips, looking over to Kyouka nervously. She merely shrugged, not knowing any other way of dealing with this than just putting it all out there. They didn’t have much choice now. “It actually involves both of those events. My…Um…I…Okay, here goes. Mom, obviously you know this, but Kyoutoku, Mika, Mr. Aizawa, I…I was born quirkless.”

Kyoutoku, along with everyone else, peered at him in confusion, “You mean they didn’t catch onto your quirk or something? A false report?”

“No,” Inko cut in, turning to the other adults. “I saw the gene tests, the X-Rays of his pinky toe, everything. Despite his father and I both having quirks, he was born without one.”

“But, then how do-...?”

“Until one day…” Inko turned back to her son, fully handing the attention back to him, “...one miraculously appeared. Back in February.”

“February?” Aizawa raised a brow, incredulously looking at his student, “The entrance exams?”

“The day of,” Izuku nodded. “But, I didn’t enter quirkless. I walked in knowing I would have a quirk appear. Almost a year beforehand, I had a run-in with a sludge villain on my way home from school. He almost got me, but All Might appeared and saved me.”

“Of course,” Aizawa sighed, turning to his coworker who sat away from everyone, leaning against the wall by the window. “You knew him all this time?”

“‘Knew him’ is a bit of an understatement,” Toshinori shrugged. “Let him finish, and then you can all chew me out.” 

Even though no one was satisfied with that answer, they let Izuku keep telling the story. 

“Even after saving me, I wouldn’t stop pestering All Might. He was my idol for my entire life, I couldn’t let the opportunity go. I was desperate to ask him something.” He saw his mother perk up ever so slightly, only for a moment. He had a feeling she knew what question he was referring to. “So, before he jumped off, I grabbed onto his leg. We landed on a rooftop, and that’s where I learned why All Might was trying to leave so fast. He was out of time for the day. He turned into how you see him now. I’ve known All Might’s secret for almost two years. But, when we parted ways, I ran into the same villain from before again. When I grabbed onto All Might’s leg, I accidentally made him drop the bottle he captured the sludge villain in. It had taken a hostage, and I ran in to help. Uh…S-Sorry I never said anything, Mom.”

Inko raised her hand out, shaking her head, “It’s okay. I have to assume with all this build-up, you had a pretty good reason not to.”

“O-Okay, well, All Might saved me again. But, he found me on my way home. He said he saw something in me and…Uh, this is where it’s going to be even harder to explain. He…He said that I could be a hero, and that he wanted to…pass on his quirk…to me.”

“...Excuse me?”/ “...Excuse me?”/ “...Excuse me?” / “...Excuse me?”

“...I have All Might’s quirk.”

Everyone sat in a dreadful silence that Izuku wished he knew how to fill. He wanted so badly to just keep explaining, but they clearly needed time to process what he just said. Kyoutoku and Mika looked like they didn’t believe him, like they were being messed with. And, he really couldn’t blame them. They raised Kyouka, so jokes and playful gaslighting probably weren’t foreign to them. 

Aizawa looked to be in deep thought, but the three One For All users in the room could see he was piecing things together. He was beginning to believe as everything began to make sense in hindsight.

But, Inko leaned forward in her seat, looking her son dead in the eye. She was reading his expression deeply, proving that she really always knew whenever her son lied. This time was no different.

Inko’s eyes widened as she finally broke the silence, “...You’re not kidding.”

“Dead serious. I swear on my life.”

“N-Now, ho-. Hold on,” Kyoutoku sputtered out, his mind still reeling. “I mean, c’mon, kid. You can’t just give quirks away. How co-”

“I swear on Kyouka’s life.”

“...Holy shit, you’re serious.”

“I didn’t believe it the first time either,” Izuku chuckled dryly.

“Me neither,” All Might joined him. “When my mentor explained it to me, I thought she was nuts. I mean, she was a little nuts, but in the good way.”

“Wait, hold on,” Kyoutoku turned to All Might, still looking at everyone like they were crazy. “This isn’t the first time this has happened?”

Toshinori shook his head, nodding towards Izuku, “Young Izuku is the ninth person to wield this power. Which, of course, means I was the eighth and so on. Young Izuku?”

He nodded, raising his hand out towards the adults as his palm glowed with power, “This quirk is passed on from person-to-person. Each wielder continuously adds their strength in the hopes that it can be used to bring hope and peace to the world. It’s called…One For All.”

Izuku closed his fist, the light fading as the quiet returned again. But, thankfully not for long, and with Kyoutoku thankfully alleviating the tension. “Okay, I gotta admit, that’s a cool God-damn name.”

“Right?” Toshinori smiled, quickly erasing his smile as Aizawa’s unamused stare returned to him. “Ah, *ahem!* Uh, back to the story, please?”

“Hold on,” Aizawa stopped them. “Where did this quirk even come from?”

Both teens slowly turned over to All Might, more or less telling him that this was all him. Toshinori stepped away from the window to properly address the adults, moving to stand next to Izuku. 

“The man I fought last night is the progenitor of One For All. He goes by All For One. If you could guess by the name, he has the ability to take and use any quirk he comes in contact with. He was the ruler of the criminal underbelly for years, and had roots across all of Japan. I spent most of my career secretly dismantling his organization, fully taking it out about seven years ago. He’s the reason I look the way I do now, and I’ll save you all the image of my scar. He gave a quirk that stockpiled strength to his brother over a century ago. His brother had a quirk that allowed him to bestow his quirk onto other people. Which, yes, seems fairly useless. But, the two powers merged together and evolved, creating One For All as we see it today…sort of.”

“...What do you mean ‘sort of’?”

“Eeeh, that’s for the kids to explain, not me. Even I don’t fully comprehend it, but there’s something else you all should know…All For One has kinda, sorta, *maybe* hunted down every single One For All user and has killed quite a few of them; my master and our family included. But, obviously he’s been defeated now. I took care of it, so…All good, right?”

Inko leaned forward, looking less than amused as she stared at Toshinori, “He *what?”*

“Well, it-”

“He wants to kill my son?!”

“Not…really. He was mostly focused on me, out of revenge.” Toshinori paused, pursing his lips as he continued to dread this conversation. “...But, All For One has a protege that may or may not have a specific interest in Young Izuku…and Young Kyouka.”

“Whoa! Wait, what?!” Kyoutoku was up off the couch now, joining in the panic. “Why my daughter?!”

“Kids, you wanna jump in here—”

“You knew.” Aizawa shoved his finger into All Might’s face, his anger completely new to his two students. Aizawa had been aggressively stern before, but they had never seen him be legitimately angry. He wasn’t shouting, but he was clearly pissed. “You knew that man was out there, and you gave this power to a *teenager?”*

“Not exactly,” Toshinori sighed, keeping his voice calm to counteract Aizawa. Shouta had every reason to be mad at him, but they were the two in the room that needed level heads the most. “Before Kamino, the last time I saw All For One was when my fist was entering one side of his skull and coming out the other, his brain matter on my knuckles. But, as it turns out, some people can just survive that. Forgive me for not going to check the body. It fell down a massive chasm, and I was doing my best to keep my intestines from falling out of my body.”

“I…I…God-Fucking-Damn it, that’s actually a legitimate excuse.”

“Wait, really? Uh, I mean, thank you. But, to be fair, giving that kind of power to a fifteen-year-old isn’t exactly ideal. But, that’s the same age I got One For All, so I thought things would turn out fine. And, honestly, take All For One out of the equation, he has been doing just fine. More than fine, actually. Buuut, I can’t take All For One out of the equation, so overall this is still a negative.”

“Hold on,” Kyoutoku cut back in. “I think we skipped the part where you said my daughter was also a target now. Because she’s Izuku’s girlfriend?”

“Dad, try to calm down.” Kyouka gently put her hand on his chest, trying to push him back to the couch. “It’s fine. If it makes you feel any better, he doesn’t wanna kill us. When we went to save Bakugou, w—”

Aizawa swerved around, his glare now set on her, “You *WHAT?!”*

Kyouka tensed up, her lips pursed as she slowly backed away, “I might’ve skipped ahead a little bit. I’ll just go back to waiting for my cue.”

“Enough!” Izuku shouted, drawing the attention back to him. “I understand why you’re all upset, but *please* calm down. We’re well past the point of changing anything. All of this has already happened. We’re here to prepare you for what’s to come.”

Kyoutoku dragged his hands down his face, slumping back down on the couch, “Kid, I’m begging you, please tell me you’re done.”

“...Well-”

“Oh my lord.”

“It…I-It kinda gets weirder. So, back at camp, things with the villain I fought weren’t exactly going well, obviously. There was a point where I ran out of options. I thought…I-I thought that the least I could do was buy Kyouka and Kota time to run. I’d stay, do what I could, but I figured I wasn’t making it back. And, well…You might see where this is going.”

“...Holy shit.” Aizawa’s focus switched to Kyouka, taking half a step forward, eyebrows going up, “Don’t tell me...”

Kyouka pursed her lips, shifting on her feet as the room’s attention switched to her. She gave a little wave, sparks of violet lightning dancing around her fingers, “...Yep.”

Everyone jumped at the sight, with both elder Jirous standing up from the couch as they stared slack-jawed at their daughter. “N-Now, before anyone says anything, it’s not that simple! Nobody knows that she has it, it’s a secret. I intend to keep it that way. I also still have One For All…Okay, that really didn’t make sense, but please let me explain.”

As difficult as it was for Kyoutoku to properly process everything that had been thrown at him in the last ten minutes, there were a couple specific parts of the puzzle that were sticking out to him as a father. Unfortunately, it was the bad parts. “...You gave it to my daughter.”

“...Oh boy.”

“You gave my daughter a quirk that makes her hunted by that guy from the news? The man who wiped out a chunk of a city without trying, and has successfully killed people with this power in the past? Actually, I’m sorry, but did All Might say he also killed his family?”

Kyouka stepped between her father and Izuku, keeping her voice gentle, “Dad, just liste—”

“What *the Hell* have you done?”

“Dad—”

“You knew, and you started a relationship with my daughter? We welcome you into our home— our family— while our lives were on the line for it? You gave it to my daughter! Y-! You've put a target on her back *specifically* . You knew about this guy, an—”

“Kyou!” Mika’s jack slung around her husband's neck, yanking him down and around to meet her gaze; something everyone else in the room then learned where Kyouka got it from. It was the first time she had spoken in a while. Izuku remembered Kyouka telling him once that Mika was quieter than he was used to in public spaces. “Who the Hell do you think you're talking about? Do you think your daughter would consider turning her back on this boy for one single second? Do you think *we’re* going to? I understand why you're upset, and above all else terrified. I am too, but this is Izuku we're talking about. There's no doubt in my mind that he's given Kyouka a hundred— No, an infinite amount of chances to leave. You think we're scared? Imagine being him, or his mother who sits two feet from you. You heard him, Kyouka's new… *thing* is a secret. Izuku is still the one in the crosshairs here.”

“We-...I-...”

Mika didn't bother letting her husband sputter together some sort of coherent sentence. “And, please try to remember a very important part of this. Izuku gave his powers away, because he thought he was going to *die* . This young man, who's practically worshipped the ground Kyouka walks on since we've known him, was going to give his *life* for her. Without him, she wouldn't even be here right now.”

Everyone was silent. Izuku was grateful he didn't have to say anything in his defense, even though he probably would have just ended up agreeing with everything Kyoutoku said.

Toshinori was doing absolutely everything in his power to blend in with the wallpaper, knowing full well he was probably the most deserving in the room to be at the brunt end of that anger. 

“She's right.” Everyone turned back to Kyouka as she nodded towards her boyfriend. “Well, actually, Izuku and I got together before he even knew about All For One. All Might didn’t even know that dick was still alive. But, even so, when Izuku told me about all of this, he fully expected I was gonna break up with him. I had to cut him off before he accidentally broke up with him *for me* . This was way before I got the crazy super-powered body, mind you. If I wasn’t going to leave him then, I’d certainly never leave him now. Sure, does that make Past-Me crazy? Wh-...Probably a little, but love is one Hell of a drug. Just listen. You may not see it this way, but this is everything I’ve been desperately wishing for since I learned about all this. Inko, do you remember when we talked in the dining room? The night after our midterms?”

“I do,” Inko nodded, finally speaking up after sitting in silence. “You wished you were able to match Izuku’s strength; to fight alongside him when the worst came.”

“Exactly! This is it! By some miracle, I can! Well, not now, I-I mean I’d probably blow my arms off if I tried. But, still! All For One was gonna come back eventually, and what would’ve happened if All Might lost? We’d all be dead whether Izuku and I were together or not. No one would stand a chance; Izuku’s not ready to face that guy or anyone close to him. If Izuku’s not, then who else? If anything, this is the best possible outcome. Because —and follow me on this one— now we have *two people* with All Might’s power. Scratch that, two people who will be *stronger* than All Might ever could be. Granted, we can’t use one-hundred percent of it at the same time, but I still see only positives here. That’s not even bringing up the fact that we might have access to a bunch of other quirks if All Might flying around last night means anything. And, this is the part where I kind of sound like a brat, but even before I had these powers, you weren’t gonna stop me. You could pull me out of UA, I’d still be there twenty-four/seven for Izuku, just like you would be for mom and I if we were in even a slightly similar situation. You’re gonna do the same for Izuku, just because that’s who you are. You’re overprotective of your family, and guess who’s included in that?”

“I know! I know, jus-...” Kyoutoku groaned as he fell back onto the sofa, blankly looking down at his lap. “It’s just a lot, okay? A whole fucking lot. I’m sorry, kid. I shouldn’t have said those things.”

“No, you should have,” Izuku quickly defended him. “This is your family we’re talking about, you’re right to be scared for their safety. I already promised myself a long time ago that I won’t let anything happen to Kyouka, no matter what. That extends to you, and everyone in this room. I accepted this responsibility, and I’ll face the consequences of it.”

“You’re just kids. You shouldn’t *have* to have these responsibilities.”

“Tell that to the hero schools worldwide,” Kyouka shrugged. 

“No, he’s right.” All Might stepped back in. “You shouldn’t have such tasks placed upon your shoulders. Not so young.”

“You didn’t have a choice,” Izuku tried to counter him. “You needed a successor as soon as possible. We didn’t have the time to wait, which is more than apparent after last night.”

“I know, my boy. It still does not excuse my blatant disregard for the other factors at play. I came here tonight knowing that apologies were in order. If anyone must face consequences, it’s me.” He turned back to the couch, bowing his head towards Kyoutoku. “Mr. Jirou, if you’re to be angry at anyone, it should be me. All of this leads back to me. Perhaps if I wasn’t so blinded by rage, vengeance, and overconfidence, I could’ve made sure All For One was truly dead the first time. I should’ve told Young Izuku about All For One from the beginning, whether I thought he was dead or not. I especially should’ve talked to him about starting a relationship. Even taking All For One out of the equation, it’s difficult balancing the life of a hero-in-training and love, especially when you were withholding a huge secret. But, Young Izuku didn’t follow in my footsteps, and entrusted your daughter with his secrets and knowledge. He forewarned her, gave her the options to leave, like I should’ve done from the start. I will take the blame for all of it, but I will not apologize for not wanting to control my protege’s life. All I wanted was for him to be as happy as he could be, and not bogged down by the never-ending pressure and loneliness this life can bring. I didn’t want him to end up like me. All this kid has done is prove that he’ll never be me. He’s better. So, please, don’t be angry with him. Be angry at me. In fact, the most deserving to be angry at me is here before us. If I may, Mrs. Midoriya?”

Inko nearly jumped in her seat at the sudden shift towards her, “Y-Yes?”

“Out of everyone in this room, you’re the one that is owed an explanation the most. I gave your son this power without your knowledge. He was only fourteen, so if anything, you should’ve been asked before the decision was ever even made.” He stepped forward, making his way to the couch to be in front of Inko, getting on his knees and bowing his head to the floor. Everyone stood baffled at his sudden stance, Inko flustered most of all. “Please, forgive me. But, you must know I made this choice with the best of intentions. I chose Young Izuku to be my successor, because I don’t think there’s anybody on this planet better suited to be the Symbol of Peace, better than me. He’s gone through hardships and pain, and through it all he still stands as the selfless and strong young man he is today. He cares, he loves, he hopes, he sacrifices. He perhaps still has a bit to learn in the ‘Conquer yourself before you conquer your enemy’ department, but he’s working on it. Your son has saved me in ways most shall never know.”

“I-...I don-”

“He’s my hero,” Toshinori raised his head, using his good arm to hold himself up as he addressed all three parents. “I know how this must sound from a stranger, but…he’s my family. Both of these kids are. I don't know what my life would be like if I never met them the way I did, and I never want to know. I’ll be doing everything in my power to prepare these two for the future. I lost two families already, and I’ll never lose another. I’ll die for them first.”

Nobody was quite sure what to say. 

Izuku had heard some of that before, but it wasn’t particularly something you could ever get used to. To hear All Might saying such things about him would’ve given young Izuku a heart attack. Hell, it would’ve given one to fourteen-year-old Izuku. 

His mom had to be completely short-circuited by this point. She hadn’t spoken much, merely just trying to process. If she had literally any other kid, it would still be a hell of a lot to hear, but Izuku? 

“Please, don’t say that.” Inko slid down off the couch, getting on her knees in front of All Might, “...In a strange way, I’ve known you for years. I’m exaggerating, of course, but I saw you everyday. On my son’s walls, his computer, his lunchbox, his shirts, every other sentence uttered out of his mouth, was you. All he ever wanted was to be like you, helping people. He learned from you to push through every struggle that came his way, no matter how hard it was. Even when he was diagnosed, he fought back. Sure, that came with its own litany of problems, but he never gave in. When his dream first shattered, I shattered. For a long time, I couldn’t be what he wanted. But, through all of it, he had you. Now, he really does have you; in the flesh. Die for him? Izuku lives and breathes for you. Well, Kyouka first, then you.”

“Wh-!” Izuku faltered as Kyouka grinned smugly next to him. “You’re on that list too, Mom!”

“I know, I know.” Inko chuckled, smiling warmly at her son before turning back to Toshinori. “Do I wish I could’ve known from the start? Of course I do. But, here and now? You saved my son before you even knew he existed. You gave him everything he ever wanted and more. You helped make him into the same person you say is even better than you. You’re asking for my forgiveness? I should be thanking you. But, if you truly feel that bad about it, then just promise me you’ll help these two. Preferably without the cost of your life, for all our sakes.”

Toshinori nodded as his heart soared, bowing his head again, “Yes, ma’am. I promise.”

Kyouka leaned in towards Izuku, whispering to him, *“Hey, if his date with Pixie Bob or the Lady Nagant stuff doesn’t work out, are we sure your mom’s still happily married?”*

*“Wh-?! Kyouka!”*

*“I’m just saying!”*

“If we could all backup a second here,” Aizawa cut back in, motioning over towards the teens.”You said this power is given away. But, Midoriya, you said you still have it?”

“Eh, well…” / “Ur, it’s complicated.” / “Okay, this time I’m not taking responsibility for this.” Izuku, Kyouka, and All Might all responded. 

“Just an explanation, please.” Aizawa groaned, his hand raised up to stop them from talking.

“...You ever heard of Paranormal Singularity Theory?” Izuku asked. The adults, outside of Toshinori, all shook their heads in confusion, awaiting an explanation. “...Oh boy.”

  
  
  

***…~AMP~...***

  
  
  

**(** **ANOTHER Explanation Later** **)**

“Your powers are bullshit.”

“We know.” / “We know.” / “We know.” Izuku, Kyouka, and Toshinori all replied respectively to Aizawa’s comment. 

“Both of you share the same stockpile of power…from two bodies.”

Izuku nodded, “ More or less. One For All is kind of complicated compared to other quirks as it is. But, there was once a set of twins born with the same telepathic quirk. Both were constantly in each other's head. It’s a little like that, in a way. One For All has grown to the point of having its own metaphysical space where the vestiges and all its information and power reside. From what I can understand, One For All just links us together through that space, and we can both draw from it. But, like Kyouka said, when one of us pulls from One For All, it sort of fades for the other. It’s like a balancing act. As far as we know, we can’t both use one-hundred percent of One For All’s power at the same time, it’s a finite source. For now, unless there’s something we’re missing. But, the quirk didn’t copy itself. Its awakening simply caused it to reform itself to fit for two people rather than one.” 

Aizawa ran his hands down his face as he paced around the room. He seemed far less panicked about the entire situation in general, and more specifically about the fact that the Problem Children were now both the Super Problem Children. 

“I think I’m gonna have a heart attack.”

“Look, Aizawa, I get it. Trust me.” All Might stopped Shouta’s pacing, stepping in front of him as he gestured back towards the couple, “You can’t leave these two alone for even a day. I think everyone in this room can attest to that fact. But, there’s a reason why you’re here.”

“Is it to give me a heart attack?”

“No. Look, it’s obvious I’m not the best teacher, but my experience as both a Pro Hero and a wielder of One For All is invaluable. With two of these little crazies now, things are even more complicated. Gran Torino is gonna be far too busy hunting down the League.” Toshinori fully focused on his coworker, a hand extended out to him. “I’d like your help in training these two. Having your help, both in and outside of the school curriculum, would benefit all of us immensely.”

Aizawa had never seen his coworker act in such a way, both in and out of costume. He never knew just how far the favoritism went, not that he could’ve before now. It went so deep that he could no longer call it favoritism, and rather nepotism. He couldn’t pride himself in being right about his suspicions when he was so close yet so, very, very, *very* far from the truth. 

He had alway respected All Might, he was a good (the best) man, but his students were his responsibility. His accusatory behavior in the past was never malicious. Despite his demeanor, he chose his job for a reason. He didn’t want them involved in something they weren’t prepared for, but apparently he was far too late. But, if that was the case, then…

He’d do what he could now.

“...It was their idea, wasn’t it?”

“...Maybe. I still agree though.”

“Hm…This has been the most insane week of my life. We live in a world where the impossible no longer exists, and yet the universe somehow continues to surprise me. Somehow it always involves you two,” Aizawa side-eyed the two teens, both nervously smiling back at him. “I’m not going to pretend I completely comprehend everything I’ve heard, I have a billion questions, especially about you two apparently going vigilante *again,* but…I’d be an idiot to not realize the importance of this. Just don’t make me regret this.”

“No promises,” Toshinori chuckled.

“...Okay then. Let’s do this,” Shouta shook All Might’s hand, nodding his head. He turned over to the couple as he crossed his arms, “Which means that you two are now in Summer School. We’ll need to work on this before school starts up again. The last thing we want is Jirou accidentally taking down the building with an earthquake. Ground Beta on Monday, nine o’clock. It’s open, has plenty of destructible environments, and it's far away from the construction crews.”

“Construction crews?” Izuku asked, with an equally confused Kyouka next to him. “What for?”

“Later. I think we’ve all had enough for the night.”

Mika stood up from the couch, brushing off her skirt, “Anybody else desperately need alcohol?”

The adults all responded with an incredibly tired, “Yes”, and began to follow Mika into the kitchen. 

Kyouka furrowed her brow as she watched All Might trudge through the kitchen door, “I thought All Might couldn’t drink?”

Izuku laughed, “He’s not supposed to, but I don’t think he cares at this point.”

Kyouka groaned as she followed after him, wanting to make sure the man could enjoy his retirement before passing out in her kitchen. Izuku rubbed at his eyes, completely and utterly exhausted. He hadn’t slept since the hospital. He blinked the fuzziness out of his eyes, finally noticing his mom hadn’t followed the others. 

She stepped up to her son, clasping his hands in between her own, “My sweet boy…All this…”

“It's completely crazy, I know.”

“Izuku, do you have any idea how surreal it is to hear All Might say those things about you? I mean, we went through three computers and seventeen computer mice of just you watching his videos online.”

“Hmhm, yeah. I know I should’ve told you, but—”

“You don’t have to explain,” Inko shook her head, tears springing into the corners of her eyes, “Even despite everything between us at the time, it’s still a big secret you felt you needed to keep. I’ve always known you were meant to be a hero, but fate dealt you a cruel hand. I knew the world wouldn’t treat you the same, and I…I think All Might was right. I don’t think there’s anyone in this world more fitting. It’s always been who you are. I just wish I could’ve told you that a long time ago.”

“Don’t worry about that,” Izuku pulled her in, hugging her tightly. “You were put in an impossible situation. I was just too stubborn to understand that. Besides, you should’ve seen UA’s entrance exam. If I went in quirkless, I would’ve been steamrolled.”

“...Maybe someone should change that.”

“Maybe someday,” Izuku pulled away from the hug, smiling down at her. “But, I think I’m out of secrets now. Unless there’s some information you want to know about Kyouka and I, in which case, I’m Fort Knox.”

“Hahaha! No, I’ll save you both the embarrassment. But, Izuku, I do have one question…What are we going to tell your father?”

Izuku peered at her, a nonchalant shrug of his shoulders, “He doesn’t need to know now. He’s not here.”

“...”

“...Mom?”

  
“...”

Izuku’s brow furrowed, afraid to ask the question he already knew the answer to, “Mom, what is it?”

“Honey…He’s coming home.”

Dabi left his room, walking over to the guard railing to look down on the large open area below. He stood on the balcony overlooking the main floor, rows of rooms behind him. He gazed around at the broken tiled floor, tan concrete walls, not a damn window in sight. Old boxes of dusty equipment and abandoned furniture were shoved into the corner so the new furniture could be moved in.

Himiko and Twice were sitting down on top of a couch Magne was carrying on her shoulder, setting it down in the middle of the room. Compress was near everyone’s luggage, which was extremely worrisome. Spinner helped Kurogiri with the crates of alcohol he managed to grab. “I can’t believe I’m saying it, but I miss the bar and the shitty apartment building.”

“You’re a whiny prick, you know that?” Tomura appeared from the second-floor hallway, hand dangling from his belt loop. “Don’t you worry. This’ll feel like hideout-sweet-hideout in no time. Besides, Compress and Magne took it upon themselves to be in charge of decorating, so we’ll at least look like we have some form of class.”

Dabi peered at his leader as he jumped over the railing, landing on the couch, making Toga and Twice bounce. “You’re taking this whole thing surprisingly well, saying that we just lost both our hideout and our mysterious benefactor.”

“Speaking of which,” Compress cut in. “When were you gonna tell us about this ‘master’ of yours?”

Tomura waved them off as he shed his peacoat and tossed it over the back of the couch, “He has an obsession with being in the shadows. It’s fine, you were still my team. Not his. Now it’s just a little more official. Although, Dabi does bring up a good point about the benefactor thing. Budget’s gonna be pretty tight for a while. I pulled everything from my master’s assets that I could, but the rest is gonna be frozen now that he’s been taken in. Not to mention he already lost a ton of his assets back when All Might dismantled his entire operation. Anyone opposed to stealing food?”

“No.” / “No.” / “No.” / “No.” / “No.” / “No. Yes!”

“Thought so. We’ll get Kurogiri some coordinates for some stores, far apart and at random. We’re gonna need to lie low for a while. We’re now the most wanted group in the country.”

“And what are we gonna do in the meantime?” Spinner asked. “What’s the plan, boss?”

“You say that like we’ve had a real plan before,” Dabi mumbled.

“There is a plan,” Tomura continued, ignoring Dabi. “As for an overarching plan? Not so much, but I have an idea that will get the hound dogs off our backs for a while. I said before that if we were successful in extracting Moonfish, I had something else in mind. Or, rather, someone else. How do we all feel about a prison break from Tartarus?”

“Hold on,” Compress held his hand up, tilting his head in confusion at Tomura. “I love a good old fashioned heist more than anyone, but you just said we need to lie low. Breaking your master out of the most maximum of maximum security prisons in the country, *immediately* after he was put in there, is an awful idea.”

“Oh, I agree. Which is why he’s not our target.” Tomura moved around the table, walking over to the pile of everyone’s luggage. He found the bag he was looking for, digging around for his binder. “My master is old and damaged, even more so after that fight. It’s my not-so-professional medical opinion that he needs plenty of rest. I think a nice stay at the Tartarus Resort— for an undetermined amount of time— will do him good. I have something else in mind. I’ve been wanting to do this for a while, but never had the means or the time to do so…”

Tomura found his binder, flipping it open and grabbing the bookmarked file. He returned to the table, throwing down the folder for everyone to see. The League looked down at the picture, brows rising at the bold name at the top.

**\[Classified:** **HPSC Restricted** **: Tartarus Prisoner 297\]: Kaina Tsutsumi (Lady Nagant)**

Twice looked around as everyone sat in silence, deciding to ask the question everyone had on their minds. “...Who dat?”

Tomura smiled, turning to Twice, “That right there is The Lovely Lady Nagant. Former Pro Hero, greatest sniper on the eastern hemisphere, past associate of All Might, and murderer of the previous HPSC Chairman.”

“Oooh, yes. I think I remember that.” Compress picked up the file, looking over the details. “And how does she help us?”

“She’s the steak we throw at the approaching lion. Tell me, my fellow degenerates, who’s the lion in this situation? Not the police…”

Everyone was quiet, not particularly sure what Tomura was getting at. That is, until Dabi looked back down at Nagant’s file as Compress laid it back down, the underlined word catching his eyes. “...The HPSC.”

“Exactly! The Hero’s Public Safety Commission.”

“Why should we care about the HPSC?” Magne shrugged. “It’s just a bunch of silver spoon politicians at the top. They’ll send heroes out to do the work, per usual.”

“Oh, not us. We don’t care; not now, anyway.” Tomura nodded down at the file, “But, she does. My master has told me plenty about the HPSC, their inner workings. Well, his information might be pretty outdated by this point. He’s been out of the loop for years, but he was in-the-know back when Nagant was there. According to him, Nagant was an HPSC assassin. Everything she did and why she killed the Chairman was never put to paper. I’m sure most of her secrets died with him. However, she clearly killed him for a reason, and then they threw her in solitary confinement without a trial. She was convicted for only one kill. Serial killers get better treatment than she did. Hell, even Toga would get a trial.”

“They technically don’t have proof of anything!” Toga smiled brightly.

“True, but still. I have a strong feeling Ms. Tsutsumi is gonna want some sweet revenge, and we’re just nice enough to help her. She goes on a crusade against the HPSC, and they’ll divert absolutely everything they can to getting her either back in jail or six-feet under. She’s a loose end they felt they didn’t need to tie, at least not properly. She’s got all these dirty little HPSC secrets in her pocket, and they’ll do whatever it takes to make sure they stay there. Giran has a couple informants inside, and luckily we still have enough money to keep paying him for a while. Apparently almost nobody ever even sees her. HPSC wants her swept under the rug and forgotten. Only a select few guards deliver her food and observe what very little time she gets outside of her cell. Toga and Twice, you’ll be taking point on this. Toga and her clones will turn into each guard on Nagant’s routine, plus one in the main camera room. You’ll enter her cell when given the green light, and Kurogiri will teleport the real Toga out. The clones will remain on duty to avoid suspicion until they turn to sludge. Ideally they’ll turn to sludge while out of sight.”

“And if they actually do get her and she tells them about us?” Dabi eyed Tomura, brow raised. “Won’t they also wonder who got her out?”

“They can’t prove it’ll be us. No one outside of this room knows what Toga’s quirk is, and hopefully the clones will vanish without a trace. I’m thinking we tell them to go to the prison showers when time is up. They’ll dissolve and flow down the drain without a trace. As for Nagant ratting us out, we’ll see when we talk to her, but I’d bet she’d rather die than give the HPSC anything that would help them. We send her out, let her do her own work away from us, while we make our next move. Whether she wants to be a part of the team afterwards is entirely up to her. Speaking of which, Compress and Magne, you’ll be in charge of getting her any supplies and sundries she may need once she joins up. Some clothes-stealing.”

Magne raised a brow, “You mean shopping?”

“I know what I said. She’ll probably live off site from us, just to be safe. I’ll keep tabs on her. Now, we’ll go over more details tomorrow. Everyone finish setting up out here and in your own rooms. I’ll go see if I can settle our internet situation.”

Dabi sighed as he watched their leader walk away, “So you can play League?”

“I’m not dignifying that!” Tomura shouted as he climbed back up the steps, a grin on his face as he reached the upper hallway. He made it to his room, shutting the door behind him as he looked around at the mess. 

There was still a bunch of old equipment and crates, but he had his bed and his computer. He’d clean the rest up tomorrow. All For One had always said organization was a necessity for a business. No one could take you seriously otherwise. He walked over to his computer, picking up the router and its cords next to his desk.

A portal swirled open at his door, Kurogiri stepping through, “Young Tomura, may I speak with you?”

“‘Course. Actually, I was gonna ask you, but I didn’t want the others to hear. When we go on those supply runs, can you make sure we get some chapstick and moisturizer? Jirou may or may not have called me ‘Crusty’, and I know it shouldn’t bother me, but it kind of does. Just put it in with Toga’s make-up stuff.”

“Of course, but I actually would like to speak with you about this plan of yours.” Kurogiri sighed, “Tomura, I must confess, while most of the results of your plan I agree with…you and I both know what you truly want Ms.Tsutsumi for.”

Tomura paused for a moment, the cord hovering over the port on the router. He plugged it in, his tone a little less casual, “Yeah? And what does that matter? It’s a win-win.”

“It matters because your reasoning is quite petty in comparison to our bigger goals. Which, and this should go without saying, but one of our bigger goals should be actually *having* a goal. This will aid as we hide, but we have no plans— or even a clue— on what to do while we wait, or where we are going.”

Tomura slowly turned his head to look back over his shoulder, his nearly-hidden face illuminated by the television light. Tomura’s eyes peek over the shaggy locks cascading down the side of his face, a clearly unamused expression on his face, “...Petty?”

“...Yes, I-”

“If you know so much, then you know why I want to see All Might suffer. That mean nothing?”

“...All I'm saying is you're the leader now, due to your own actions. You're all we have. Prove to them that you haven’t jumped the gun. We don’t have tim-”

“We have plenty of time, Kurogiri. We dedicate as much time to something as I say we do, because it’s just like you said. I'm the leader, it’s *my* choice now. For the first time in my life, I don’t have someone blabbering in my fucking ear, telling me what *they* think is best. I formed the team, made the camp plan, and the Aldera plan. I’ll figure it out, but I’ve put this off long enough. I’ve been waiting my entire life to finally hurt him, and I intend to do so. Is that all?”

“...Yes, Tomura. Have a pleasant rest of your evening.” Kurogiri vanished in a swirl of darkness, leaving Tomura alone once more.

Tomura sighed, clenching his fist to stamp down his frustration. He turned towards the corner of his room, staring directly into the left-on TV. They still had no signal, leaving the screen as static. 

The same static his master would speak to him through.

Tomura reached over his desk, clicking the power button on the remote, the screen going black.

*“...Now, it’s my turn.”*
