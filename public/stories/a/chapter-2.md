# Chapter 2

Berlin at three in the morning smelled like rain and bratwurst. Aris leaned against the railing of the Oberbaumbrücke, watching the Spree River reflect the city lights in shattered patterns. Behind him, the twin towers of the bridge rose into the darkness like something out of a fairy tale. Ahead, the nightclub district of Friedrichshain pulsed with bass-heavy music and the laughter of people young enough to believe they were immortal.

He'd sold the HYDRA energy cells two hours ago to a collector who paid in Bitcoin and didn't ask questions. Clean transaction, no complications, exactly how he preferred things. The money was already dispersed across six different accounts, untraceable and secure.

Now he was waiting.

The contact Natasha had specified—a SHIELD courier operating under civilian cover—was seven minutes late. Aris didn't particularly care. The cold didn't bother him; he could regulate his body temperature by manipulating the thermal energy in his immediate vicinity. A useful trick in winter, though it meant he had to consciously remember to shiver occasionally in public to avoid looking suspicious.

His phone buzzed. Text from an unknown number: *Blue Mercedes. Two minutes.*

Aris pocketed the phone and waited, studying the pedestrians crossing the bridge. A couple arguing in Turkish. Three students sharing a joint and laughing too loud. An old woman walking a dachshund that looked deeply offended by the cold.

No obvious surveillance. No one radiating the particular electromagnetic signature of concealed weapons or communication devices.

The Mercedes appeared exactly on schedule, pulling to the curb near the U-Bahn entrance. The driver stayed in the car. Passenger window rolled down.

"You need a lift?" A woman's voice, American accent trying for German inflection and failing.

"Depends where you're going," Aris replied, the agreed-upon response.

"Somewhere warm."

He opened the door and slid into the passenger seat. The driver was mid-thirties, brown hair pulled back, the kind of forgettable face that blended into crowds. Professional. Her eyes flicked to the rearview mirror constantly, checking for tails.

"Kaine?" she asked.

"That's what people call me."

She handed him a waterproof case about the size of a briefcase. "Everything Romanoff compiled. Satellite imagery, thermal scans, what we know about the facility's history. There's also a sat phone—encrypted, scrambled, traceable back to about forty different locations if anyone tries to ping it."

Aris opened the case. Tablet, phone, and three USB drives, all nestled in foam padding. "Thorough."

"She said you'd need to go in blind if the operation got compromised. This gives you everything we have so you can make your own decisions." The driver merged into traffic, heading east. "I'm taking you to Schönefeld. Private hangar. There's a plane fueled and waiting—will get you to Vladikavkaz by dawn. From there, you're on your own."

"Romanoff's not joining me?"

"She'll meet you on-site if the situation requires it. Right now, she's maintaining plausible deniability." The driver took a corner with practiced ease. "You get caught in Russia, SHIELD doesn't know you. You get killed, we never heard of you. Standard protocol for black bag operations."

"Comforting."

"It's the spy business. Comfort's not really in the budget." She glanced at him, eyes sharp. "Romanoff vouched for you. That means something in our organization. Don't make her regret it."

Aris studied the woman's profile. Mid-level operative, probably field-trained but riding a desk these days. The way she held the steering wheel suggested old injuries to her right shoulder—compensating without realizing it.

"What's your name?" he asked.

"Does it matter?"

"Probably not. But I like to know who's threatening me."

The corner of her mouth twitched. "Agent Morse. Barbara Morse."

"Well, Agent Morse, you can tell Romanoff I don't plan on getting caught or killed. Bad for my reputation."

"Your reputation says you're good at acquiring things and bad at following orders."

"One of those is definitely true."

They drove in silence for several minutes, the Berlin cityscape giving way to industrial zones and eventually the approach roads to Schönefeld Airport. Morse bypassed the main terminals, taking a service road that led to a cluster of private hangars on the facility's eastern edge.

The plane was a Gulfstream G650, sleek and expensive, the kind of aircraft that billionaires used for weekend trips to Monaco. No visible markings, registration number filed under a shell corporation that probably traced back to SHIELD's black budget.

"Pilot's already aboard," Morse said, pulling up beside the hangar. "Former Air Force, been flying for SHIELD for six years. She'll get you where you need to go."

Aris grabbed the case and stepped out. Cold wind cut across the tarmac, carrying the smell of jet fuel.

"Kaine." He turned back. Morse had rolled down her window, expression serious. "Whatever's in that facility... Romanoff thinks it's important enough to risk burning you as an asset. That means it's bad. Real bad. Be careful."

"Always am."

"Bullshit. I read your file. You redirected an explosion that should've killed fifteen people. Threw yourself directly into the blast radius."

"And everyone lived. That's what counts."

Morse shook her head. "Just... don't die stupidly, okay? We've lost too many good operators to stupid already."

She drove away before he could respond, taillights disappearing into the pre-dawn darkness. Aris watched her go, then turned toward the waiting aircraft.

The pilot met him at the stairs—a woman in her forties with short-cropped hair and the calm demeanor of someone who'd flown through worse than a simple transport run. "Mr. Kaine. I'm Captain Chen. We're wheels up in ten minutes if you're ready."

"Born ready."

She snorted. "Sure you were. Buckle up. It's going to be a bumpy ride—we're skirting some weather systems over Poland and there's a low-pressure front coming in from the Black Sea."

The interior of the Gulfstream was configured for business rather than pleasure—minimal luxury, maximum functionality. Aris settled into one of the leather seats and opened the case Morse had given him.

The tablet booted up immediately, displaying a menu with labeled files. He started with the facility overview.

The site was designated Object 47, built in 1978 as part of a Soviet program called Project Zmey—Dragon. Official purpose: high-altitude atmospheric research. Actual purpose: human enhancement experiments using a combination of chemical treatments, radiation exposure, and something called "vibrational frequency manipulation."

Aris's fingers stilled on the screen.

Vibrational frequency manipulation. Energy manipulation. His specialty.

He forced himself to keep reading.

Project Zmey had been shut down in 1984 after a catastrophic containment failure killed seventeen researchers and an unknown number of test subjects. The facility was sealed, declared a biohazard zone, and left to rot for the next two decades. But according to SHIELD's intelligence, someone had reopened it six months ago. New equipment, new personnel, new experiments.

The satellite imagery showed recent activity—supply deliveries, helicopter traffic, thermal signatures consistent with underground laboratories operating at full capacity. Then, three days ago, everything stopped. The last thermal scan showed residual heat patterns but no movement. No personnel. Nothing.

Just that single encrypted distress call.

*Help us. Please. They're all dead. We're trapped. Section Seven. Help—*

Then silence.

Aris scrolled through the personnel files SHIELD had managed to compile. Grainy photos, partial names, known associates. Most were low-level HYDRA remnants, the kind of desperate scientists who'd do anything for funding after the fall of SHIELD scattered their organization. But one face made him stop.

Dr. Yuri Volkov. Age sixty-three. Biophysicist specializing in human augmentation. Formerly employed at a Red Room facility in Belarus until its destruction in 1998.

The Red Room. Where they'd trained Natasha.

This wasn't coincidence. SHIELD had to know about the connection, which meant Romanoff had deliberately chosen not to mention it during their meeting in Prague. The question was why—was she protecting herself, or him?

The plane's engines hummed to life, a subtle vibration that Aris felt through his entire nervous system. Energy in motion, controlled combustion, electromagnetic fields dancing through complex machinery. He could disrupt it all with a thought, send the aircraft tumbling from the sky by shorting out the electrical systems.

The power was always there, humming just beneath his skin. Waiting.

Sometimes he hated it.

Captain Chen's voice crackled over the intercom. "We're cleared for takeoff, Mr. Kaine. Flight time to Vladikavkaz is approximately four hours. There's coffee in the galley, bathroom's aft. Try to get some rest—you look like you need it."

Aris closed the tablet and leaned back, closing his eyes. Rest. Right. As if he could sleep knowing what waited in the Caucasus mountains.

He'd been fifteen years old the first time he'd killed someone. Not fifteen in the normal sense—he'd been alive much longer by then, decades beyond what his appearance suggested. But his body had been fifteen, young and terrified and full of power he barely understood.

The man had been a researcher. White coat, clipboard, the kind of polite professionalism that masked profound cruelty. He'd been explaining the next round of tests, something about "pain threshold analysis" and "energy discharge under duress," when Aris had finally snapped.

One moment the researcher was standing there. The next, every cell in his body was vibrating at a frequency incompatible with biological function. He'd come apart at a molecular level, reduced to constituent atoms in less than a second.

No blood. No screaming. Just there, then not there.

Aris had stared at his hands, at the residual energy crackling between his fingers, and understood with horrible clarity what he was capable of.

The facility had burned that night. Aris made sure of it. Every researcher, every guard, every scrap of data about Project Genesis and the boy they'd designated Subject Zero. All of it reduced to ash and melted steel.

He'd walked away without looking back, started running, and hadn't stopped for eighty-three years.

The plane lifted off smoothly, pressing him back into the seat. Through the window, Berlin spread out below in a constellation of lights, beautiful and indifferent.

Aris opened his eyes and pulled out the sat phone. One number programmed into the contacts. He typed a message:

*Red Room connection. You should have mentioned it.*

The response came within thirty seconds:

*Would it have changed your answer?*

He stared at the screen, considering. Natasha Romanoff had her own ghosts, her own history of being someone's experiment. Maybe that's why she'd recruited him. Not despite the connection to the Red Room, but because of it.

*No,* he typed back. *But I don't like surprises.*

*Neither do I. That's why I'm sending you instead of going myself.*

*Coward.*

*Pragmatist. If it's a trap, better to spring it with someone who can walk away from an explosion.*

Fair point. Aris pocketed the phone and retrieved the tablet again, pulling up the facility schematics. Seven underground levels, connected by a central shaft with both elevator and stairwell access. Power generation on Level Two. Living quarters on Level Three. Laboratories on Levels Four through Six.

And Section Seven—the deepest level, accessible only through a single reinforced door that required biometric clearance.

That's where the distress call had originated.

Whatever they'd been working on, whatever had gone wrong, it had started in Section Seven and spread upward. The question was whether anyone was still alive to rescue, or if he was flying into a tomb.

The plane banked east, chasing the dawn. Aris worked through the intelligence files methodically, memorizing layouts, cataloging potential threats, planning entry and exit routes. By the time Captain Chen announced their descent into Vladikavkaz, he'd constructed a mental map of Object 47 detailed enough to navigate blind.

Good thing, too. He had a feeling visibility was going to be a problem.

---

Vladikavkaz sprawled at the base of the Caucasus Mountains, a city caught between Russian administrative efficiency and the wild independence of the North Ossetian highlands. The airport was small, civilian, with exactly one customs officer who looked supremely uninterested in Aris's forged German passport.

A car waited in the parking lot—black SUV, tinted windows, keys under the floor mat. SHIELD efficiency at work. Aris threw his gear in the back and headed south, following the winding mountain roads into increasingly desolate terrain.

The landscape shifted from urban sprawl to scattered villages to nothing at all. Snow-capped peaks loomed against the morning sky, beautiful and hostile. The coordinates Natasha had provided led him off the main highway onto a logging road that hadn't seen maintenance in at least a decade.

Three hours of bone-jarring driving brought him to the end of the navigable route. Aris parked the SUV in a small clearing and checked his equipment. Tactical gear, climbing harness, weapons he probably wouldn't use but carried anyway. The sat phone. A device that looked like a smartphone but was actually a portable electromagnetic scanner, SHIELD-designed and absurdly expensive.

And a small leather journal, worn and water-stained, that he'd been carrying since 1952.

He left the journal in the SUV. Some things shouldn't go into potentially hostile facilities.

The hike to Object 47 took ninety minutes, following a trail that existed more in theory than practice. Aris moved carefully, using his abilities to sense the terrain ahead—mapping thermal variations, detecting the faint electromagnetic signatures of buried cables and sensors. The facility had early warning systems, but they were old, Soviet-era technology that broadcast their presence like beacon fires to anyone who could read energy patterns.

He bypassed three motion sensors and one camera cluster before reaching the perimeter.

Object 47's surface structures were exactly as the satellite imagery had shown—concrete bunkers half-buried in the mountainside, blast doors weathered by decades of harsh climate, snow drifted against walls. Silent. Empty.

Too empty.

Aris crouched behind a boulder and pulled out the scanner. The device hummed softly as it analyzed the electromagnetic spectrum, painting a picture in wavelengths human eyes couldn't perceive.

No active electronics in the surface buildings. No thermal signatures suggesting human presence. But deep underground, there was something—a faint, irregular pulse of energy that felt wrong. Not the steady hum of machinery or the chaotic scatter of living nervous systems.

Something else.

He approached the main entrance, a reinforced steel door set into the mountain itself. The biometric panel beside it was dark, non-functional. Someone had forced the door open—recently, based on the fresh scratches around the locking mechanism.

Aris drew his sidearm, a Sig Sauer P226 that he'd never actually fired at a living person but carried for appearances, and stepped inside.

The entry corridor stretched fifty feet before opening into a larger chamber—the facility's main elevator shaft. Emergency lighting flickered along the walls, running on backup batteries that were clearly near the end of their operational life. The air smelled stale, chemical, with an underlying rot that made his stomach clench.

The elevator car sat at ground level, doors open, displaying seven buttons for seven levels.

Aris ignored it. Elevators were kill boxes. He took the stairs.

Descending through Object 47 was like walking into someone's nightmare. Each level showed signs of hasty evacuation—papers scattered across floors, equipment left running until the power failed, meals abandoned mid-consumption. But no bodies. No blood. No obvious signs of violence.

Just abandonment, sudden and complete.

Level Four—the first of the laboratory sections—was where things got strange.

The main lab was a long room filled with examination tables, each one equipped with restraints designed for human subjects. Monitoring equipment lined the walls, screens dark, cables trailing like dead vines. And in the center of the room, someone had spray-painted a message in Russian:

*DON'T GO TO SEVEN*

Aris stood in the flickering emergency lighting and stared at the words. They'd been written in haste, paint dripping down the concrete wall. The Cyrillic letters were shaky, desperate.

A warning.

He pulled out the sat phone and took a photo, then sent it to Natasha with a single word: *Promising.*

Her response: *Turn back?*

*Not a chance.*

Level Five held more laboratories, these ones specialized for something involving neural interfaces—he recognized the equipment from a black market catalog he'd studied during a job in Seoul. Devices for reading and manipulating brain activity, some experimental, some banned by international treaty.

The message appeared here too, in different handwriting: *SEVEN IS SEALED FOR A REASON*

Level Six was different. Here, the emergency lights were brighter, powered by a separate backup system that was still functional. The corridor was clean, organized, professional. And at the end of it, a single door stood open, revealing what looked like a command center.

Monitors lined the walls, most dark but three still displaying static-filled feeds from security cameras. A desk held multiple keyboards and what looked like communication equipment. And sitting in the chair, slumped forward with her head on the desk, was a woman.

Aris approached carefully, weapon raised. The woman didn't move. He could sense her bioelectric signature—alive, unconscious, heart rate slow but steady.

"Hey," he said quietly. "Can you hear me?"

No response. He touched her shoulder gently and she jerked upright with a gasp, eyes wild, swinging something metallic.

Aris caught her wrist easily, the wrench she'd been holding freezing in midair. "Easy. I'm not here to hurt you."

She stared at him, breathing hard. Mid-twenties, Slavic features, wearing a lab coat over jeans and a sweater. Dark circles under her eyes suggested days without proper sleep.

"You're real," she whispered in Russian. "You're actually real. I thought—I thought I was the only one left."

"What happened here?" Aris asked, releasing her wrist.

She looked at him like he'd asked why water was wet. "We opened Section Seven. We thought we could control it." A laugh, sharp and broken. "We were so fucking stupid."

"Control what?"

"The subject. Subject Zero-Seven." She stood on shaky legs, moving to one of the still-functioning monitors. Her fingers flew across the keyboard, pulling up files, security footage, data streams. "Dr. Volkov said it was stable. Said the containment protocols would hold. But he didn't understand what it could do."

The monitor flickered, displaying grainy footage from a camera somewhere deep in the facility. Aris watched as the timestamp rolled back seventy-two hours.

The image showed a hallway, sterile and white, ending in a massive reinforced door. Several figures in hazmat suits stood before it, working the electronic locks. The door began to open, sliding aside with ponderous weight.

For a moment, nothing happened.

Then the screen went white—a burst of light so intense the camera couldn't process it. When the image returned, the hallway was empty. The suited figures were gone. And in the center of the frame, something moved.

Aris leaned closer, trying to make sense of what he was seeing. The shape was humanoid, roughly, but it seemed to flicker—present one moment, absent the next, like a glitch in reality itself.

"What is that?" he asked.

"We don't know," the woman whispered. "Volkov's notes called it Project Resonance. A human subject who'd been exposed to exotic energy frequencies until their molecular structure became... unstable. Able to exist in multiple quantum states simultaneously."

The thing on the screen moved down the hallway with jerking, unnatural motions. When it touched the walls, they cracked, concrete fracturing as if the basic atomic bonds were coming apart.

"It killed them all," the woman continued. "Everyone in Section Seven first. Then it spread upward, level by level. Some people it just... dissolved. Turned them into dust. Others disappeared entirely—we'd see them on one camera, then they'd blink out of existence. By the time we realized we couldn't stop it, it was too late to run."

"But you survived."

"I locked myself in here. Triggered the emergency seals between Level Six and Level Seven." She touched the monitor with a shaking hand. "I've been watching it down there for three days. Waiting. It tried to get through the door twice, but the containment field is holding. For now."

Aris studied the footage again. The entity—Subject Zero-Seven, Project Resonance, whatever the hell it was—had stopped at the sealed door separating the levels. It paced in front of the barrier, flickering in and out of visible spectrum, occasionally reaching out to touch the door with appendages that looked more like probability waves than actual limbs.

"The distress call," he said. "You sent it."

"Yes. I thought—I hoped someone would come. Someone who could help." She looked at him properly for the first time, taking in his tactical gear, the weapons, the confidence that came from walking into a nightmare facility alone. "Are you SHIELD?"

"Freelance. SHIELD hired me to extract survivors and retrieve data." Aris pulled out the sat phone. "I'm getting you out of here first. Then we figure out what to do about your quantum ghost problem."

"You can't fight it," she said urgently. "Bullets don't work. Explosives don't work. It exists partially outside normal space-time. The only thing containing it is the electromagnetic field generator in Section Seven, and if that fails—"

"Then we have a much bigger problem." Aris began typing a message to Natasha. *Found a survivor. Also found a quantum anomaly that's killed approximately forty people. Going to need extraction and possibly a nuclear option.*

The response came quickly: *Can you contain it?*

He looked at the monitor, at the thing pacing behind the sealed door. An entity made of unstable energy, existing in multiple states, tearing apart matter at the molecular level just by proximity.

Something that sounded uncomfortably familiar.

"Maybe," he typed back. "Going to try something stupid first."

"Define stupid," Natasha replied.

But Aris had already pocketed the phone. He turned to the woman. "What's your name?"

"Irina. Irina Volkov."

"Dr. Volkov's daughter?"

She nodded, looking miserable. "He made me help. Said it was important research, that we were advancing human evolution. I didn't know it would..." She gestured helplessly at the monitors.

"Not your fault," Aris said, though he wasn't sure he believed it. "Where's the control system for the electromagnetic containment field?"

"Here." She pulled up a different screen, showing a schematic of Level Seven. "There's a primary generator and three backup systems. All running at maximum capacity just to hold the containment field stable."

"Can you boost the field strength? Make it smaller, more concentrated?"

Irina frowned. "Theoretically, yes. But why would you—" Her eyes widened. "No. No, absolutely not. If you go down there, it will kill you."

"Probably not." Aris checked his weapons, more out of habit than any belief they'd be useful. "I have experience with unstable energy states. More than you'd think."

"That thing killed forty-three people in less than twenty-four hours."

"Then I'd better not fuck this up."

He started for the door. Irina grabbed his arm, surprising strength in her grip.

"Please," she said. "I've watched enough people die. Just—just take me out of here and call in someone trained for this. The Avengers, or whoever handles cosmic threats."

Aris gently removed her hand. "The Avengers are busy saving New York from aliens. And by the time anyone else gets here, that containment field might fail. How long until the backup generators run dry?"

She checked her monitors, face pale. "Eighteen hours. Maybe twenty."

"Then we don't have time to wait." He met her eyes, saw the fear there, the exhaustion, the guilt. "I'm going to go down to Section Seven. I'm going to figure out what Subject Zero-Seven is and how to neutralize it. And you're going to stay here and monitor the containment field. If something goes wrong, if I don't make it back, you seal every door between here and the surface and you run. Understand?"

"This is insane."

"Welcome to my life." Aris smiled, trying for reassuring and probably landing somewhere near reckless. "I've done crazier things than talk to quantum anomalies."

He left before she could argue further, descending the last stairwell toward Section Seven.

The temperature dropped as he went deeper, the air growing thick with something that wasn't quite ozone but felt similar—the electromagnetic tang of reality being bent out of shape. His own abilities hummed in response, energy calling to energy, and Aris had to consciously suppress the urge to draw power from his surroundings.

Not yet. Not until he understood what he was dealing with.

The sealed door between Level Six and Level Seven was three feet of reinforced steel backed by a shimmering energy barrier visible even to normal sight. Beyond it, through a small window of reinforced glass, Aris could see the corridor where the entity had first emerged.

And there, at the far end, flickering in and out of existence like a badly tuned television, was Subject Zero-Seven.

Up close, it was worse than the security footage suggested. The shape was humanoid but wrong—proportions shifting from moment to moment, edges blurred by quantum uncertainty. Where it moved, reality warped, concrete walls developing fractures that spread like frost patterns.

Aris pressed his palm against the glass and closed his eyes, extending his senses.

The entity radiated energy in wavelengths he'd never encountered before—not electromagnetic, not thermal, not kinetic. Something deeper, more fundamental. The frequency at which matter itself vibrated, the quantum foam that underlay physical reality.

And beneath that, faint but present, he felt something else.

Fear. Pain. Confusion.

This wasn't just a monster. It was a person. Someone who'd been transformed into something they couldn't control, trapped in a state of existence that was agony to maintain.

Someone like him.

Aris opened his eyes and pulled out the sat phone, typing quickly:

*Going in. If you don't hear from me in thirty minutes, tell Agent Morse she was right—I died stupidly.*

Natasha's response: *Don't.*

*Too late.*

He pocketed the phone and turned to the control panel beside the sealed door. Irina's voice crackled over a speaker: "Kaine, please reconsider. The moment you breach that door—"

"I know. Open it."

"I can't—"

"Irina." He kept his voice gentle but firm. "Open the door. Trust me."

A long pause. Then: "God help us both."

The electromagnetic barrier flickered and died. Aris gripped the wheel lock on the steel door and turned it, feeling the massive bolts retract. The door swung open with a hiss of equalizing pressure.

The entity at the end of the corridor stopped moving.

For a moment, they stood there—man and quantum anomaly, separated by fifty feet of cracked concrete. Aris could feel the wrongness radiating from Subject Zero-Seven, the way it bent space and time just by existing.

He took a step forward.

The entity flickered, present-not-present-present again, and when it stabilized it had moved ten feet closer without appearing to cross the distance.

"Easy," Aris said softly, raising his hands. "I'm not here to hurt you."

Another flicker. Closer. He could see details now—the vague suggestion of a face, features that couldn't quite decide what they were, eyes that existed in superposition between multiple colors.

"I know what they did to you," Aris continued, taking another step. "I know what it feels like to be someone's experiment. To have your body turned into something you can't control."

The entity made a sound—not quite speech, more like reality itself distorting. But Aris thought he heard words beneath the static: *...help... can't... stop...*

"I know. But I can help you." He was close enough now to see the way the entity's form rippled, cycling through different quantum states. "I have abilities too. Energy manipulation. If I can just—"

The entity surged forward, not attacking but reaching out, desperate. Its hand—if it could be called that—touched Aris's chest.

Reality shattered.
