# The Consequences

The first change was small. Maya wanted to go back to yesterday and prevent herself from saying something embarrassing to her crush. Simple. Easy. What harm could it do?

But when they returned to the present, things were different.

Maya's crush wasn't ignoring her anymore. In fact, they were dating. And that was great, except...

"Where's Jake?" Sam asked, looking around the apartment. Jake should have been there, but he wasn't. And his number wasn't in their phones. And when they tried to call his house, no one answered.

Panic set in. They went back, further this time, trying to find where Jake had gone. But the more they traveled, the more things changed. Small changes cascaded into bigger ones. Friends they'd had for years simply... weren't there anymore. Events they remembered never happened.

They were breaking time. And they had no idea how to fix it.

Worse still, they weren't alone. Someone else was using the watch—or a watch like it. They kept seeing flashes of another time traveler, someone in dark clothes who always seemed to be one step ahead.

"It's like they're following us," Maya said, after their latest jump left them in a timeline where they'd never met. "Every time we change something, they're there, watching."

Sam examined the watch more carefully. There were more symbols on it than they'd noticed before. And one of them was glowing—a warning, maybe? A sign that they'd pushed too far?

"We need to stop," Sam said. "Before we make it worse. Before we break everything."

But stopping wasn't that simple. Because every timeline they visited, every change they made, left echoes. Ripples. And somewhere in those ripples, they could feel something watching. Something waiting.

The watch wasn't just a tool. It was a trap. And they'd already sprung it.

Now they just had to figure out how to escape.
