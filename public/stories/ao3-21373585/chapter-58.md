**A/N:** **Ok, so there's a joke in this chapter that I'm not totally sure about. It's actually one that's been made for years now, but now was the time it actually came up for whether or not to go through with it. I have a feeling you'll all know what I'm talking about, but if not, it involves a desk.**

**It could just remain a joke here and nothing else, I could rewrite it entirely...Or, I could actually go through with it.**

**If I don't, it'll just go to the deleted/unused scenes document that hopefully will be released someday.**

***~...AMP…~***

  
  

Kaina sat on her cot, back against the wall, sketchbook resting on her legs. She had picked up sketching a long time ago, after earning enough goodwill points to be allowed a hobby. 

She could tell that they were very hesitant to give her a pencil, but they relented. Perhaps they were hoping instead of stabbing a guard, she’d just end up killing herself instead.

Kaina perked up as the door to her cell opened with a screech of metal, her personal tin can finally opened for the day. 

…But, it was too early in the day for recreation. *Way* too early.

She sat up in bed, brow furrowed as the door fully opened, revealing a young man with blonde hair and scruff. Clearly a hero, based on the outfit. But, the true dead giveaway was what followed him. He stepped through the door, closing it shut behind him, the locks fastening with a loud clank of metal. 

Crimson, vibrant wings stretched out behind him…

Hawks groaned as his wings popped, flapping them a little, “Why are so many doorways so small? Anyway, morning.”

“...” Kaina swung her legs over the side of the bed, remaining silent as she watched him carefully. 

“...Right, anyway. What’s up? I’m Hawks, and I’m here investigating an attack that happened last night. You hear about that? I dunno, how fast does news travel here? You see any current events on the library computers?”

“Not for a few days,” Kaina shook her head. “I don’t know what you’re talking about.”

Hawks’ little smirk never left his face as he just gazed at Kaina, not saying a word. He leaned against the door, crossing his arms, “...Hm. Well, last night, there was a charity gala. The HPSC one they hold every year in Tokyo. You went to quite a few back in the day, right? Anyway, during the night, a bullet shot right through the skyroof and landed right in front of All Might, just barely missing him. Now, don’t panic. He’s perfectly fine. Figured you’d be concerned since you used to run around with him.”

Kaina squinted at him, humming to herself, “Not many people know about that.”

“Ah, what can I say? Big fan. But, a Pro chased after the assassin, goes by the name of Pixie Bob. You ever heard of her? Blonde hair, blue eyes, long strand of hair at the front, been on all the tabloids lately.” Kaina didn’t say anything, merely shrugged in response. “Well, apparently, she actually got to fight the assassin. Got a pretty good look at ‘em too. A woman. Pale skin, short, pink and indigo hair, and stick with me for this one…Her quirk seemed to be a rifle that extended out of her arm.”

Their gazes were both completely unwavering, Kaina’s completely blank, and Hawks slightly amused, thinking he had control. 

“Quite a coincidence.”

“Pfft! Understatement of the century.”

“It has to be a coincidence. I’ve been here the whole time. The whole time being six-years, by the way.”

“Yeah, it would appear so,” Hawks nodded, hands on his hips as he began to pace. “As far as the guards are concerned, you haven’t left your cell. There was actually a weird incident with the guards on your rotation. Did you hear about that? Apparently, they all were visited by the League of Villains. Uh, some glorified crew running around as villains, just in case you didn’t know. But, they were all unconscious for what seemed like days, and suddenly they woke up in their homes, perfectly safe and sound. The craziest part is that they all clocked-in for work. They’re on record, they’re on the security cams, everything.”

“Hm, you’re right. That is pretty crazy. What? Mind control? Not exactly my department.”

“Not a bad theory,” Hawks nodded. “But, you see, the League also attacked a campground with hero students not too long ago. Reports from one of the teachers say that one of the villains just completely melted into nothing but a puddle, and yet they reappeared just fine later on. Now, I know what you’re thinking. Isn’t that just his quirk? But, the guy seemed to have a fire quirk. So, here’s my theory…Doppelgangers.”

“I’ve seen crazier,” Kaina shrugged. “Buddy, is there a fucking point to all this? If you’re here to kill me, kill me.”

Hawks scoffed, staring at her in confusion, “Kill you? What are you talking about?”

“You know, it really is impressive,” Kaina continued, ignoring his question. “They have their hands shoved so far up your ass, they can puppet you from this far away. You think I’m a doppelganger? Then just kill me. I’d rather die than spend another second wasting away in this Hell, all for the pure scum that have you on a leash. You’re their new little pet. I should’ve known. I should’ve gotten you out of there the moment I saw you.”

“Whoa-ho-ho! What the fuck are you talkin’ about, lady? They forget to pass around the sedatives today?”

“You’re that little boy they dragged around all those years ago. We met in the lobby at the Musutafu branch. I should’ve saved you…But, now it’s too late for you. Just like it is for me.” Hawks, for the first time in years, was left utterly speechless. The moment he walked through the door, she knew who he was. She had been waiting for six years to see who walked through that door. “Tell me something, though. If I’m a doppelganger, how’d they get me out? There’s no way on Earth that they could possibly sneak me out.” 

“...Portals,” Hawks answered, his smirk finally gone. “...One of the League members can create portals. To what extent, we don’t know. But, if I had to make a guess on limited information? He can at least create a portal to somewhere he knows. They come in, go to your cell, tell him where to put a portal.”

“Hm…” Kaina stood up from her cot, humming to herself. She slightly raised her right arm, Hawks’ eyes flickering down as his muscles tensed up. “Not bad, kid…Now, do your job.”

Like two outlaws under the high-noon sun, they drew their weapons. Kaina’s arm folded, her rifle extending out and aimed right between Hawks’ eyes as his wing swung forward, a razor sharp feather firing right towards Kaina. 

The alarms blared, sensing the use of both quirks. Red lights flashed, the screech of the alarm ringing across the entire section of Tartarus. 

The feather pierced right through Kaina’s chest, forcing her back and slamming her against the wall. 

Kaina’s body began to lose its form, melting like wax as globs of reddish-brown sludge began to fall from her skin.

Hawks grimaced in disgust as he walked over her, looking at the body as it continued to fall away. He looked down at her rifle, noticing the chamber was empty. She never had a bullet to begin with. 

Then, the lifeless body suddenly jumped forward, grabbing Hawks by the collar.

“You go on back to your masters now, kid. Tell those motherfuckers…” Kaina gripped Hawks’ collar, refusing to let go as her body fully melted away, a wide smile on her face, "...I’m coming for ‘em.”

Her body completely melted, falling into a puddle in front of Hawks. He blinked a couple times, eyes wide as he stared at the puddle, his feather soaking in the middle of it. The door behind him swung open as guards began to pile into the cell, weapons at the ready as they looked around for Kaina. As they all eventually noticed what Hawks was looking at, they surrounded the puddle. One guard looked up at him, brows raised, “...What happened?”

Hawks merely shook his head, his feather floating back up and returning to his wings as he turned around and walked away, “I have no fucking idea.”

**(** **AMP’s Bedroom** **)**

  
  

Izuku’s eyes fluttered open, seeing beams of the sunrise coming through the curtains. They had fallen back to sleep after their journey through the past, still completely exhausted from last night. 

Once again, he found himself in such an odd position. How Kyouka always managed to move both him and herself so drastically in her sleep was a mystery. Despite falling asleep on his side while holding Kyouka, she had pulled Izuku on top of her, practically using him as a second blanket, his head on her chest and jacks wrapped around them both. 

Did it count as being trapped if he never wanted to leave?

Kyouka’s jack suddenly snaked out of the blankets and poked his nose as she mumbled, “You muttered that out loud. The answer is no, by the way.”

Izuku smiled, kissing her collarbone, “Good morning.”

“Morning,” Kyouka hummed, still not opening her eyes. “Being motorboated is quite a way to wake-up.”

“Hey, you’re the one that put my head here.”

“Mhm.” Kyouka wrapped her arms around his head, hugging him even closer. “You okay?”

“I’m okay. All in the past. What about you? How’s your body?”

“Are you talking mentally or the fact that I got my shit rocked last night?”

“Hmhmhm, both,” Izuku chuckled, looking at the bruise on her cheek.

“Then, surprisingly good for both. Oh, speaking of that. I didn’t wanna say anything, cause last night really wasn’t the time. I don’t know if it’s still in bad taste, but…Tonight, do you wanna go back into One For All and watch me kick Bakugou in the dick?”

Izuku instantly propped himself up on his elbow, staring down at her with wide eyes, “You actually did it?”

“Is that a yes?”

“...Maybe.”

Kyouka smiled, propping herself up to be nose-to-nose with Izuku, a smile on her face, “That’s a yes.”

“...I really wanna see it.”

“Hahaha! I won’t spoil it entirely, but…I got air.”

Izuku’s brows rose, “As in, you got him off the ground?”

“Understatement.”

“...I love you so much.”

Kyouka laughed as Izuku’s lips met hers, her arms snaking around his shoulders. She let out a little gasp as he moved down her neck towards her chest, “You really wanna get it on after a night of trauma-dumping?”

“Sorry…” Izuku propped himself up on arms, looking down at her, “I guess after all that, all I want to feel is…good, you know?”

“Yeah, I get it.”

“I-If you’re not in the mood, I-” Kyouka’s jack pressed against his lips, cutting him off as she deadpanned up at him.

“Shut up and kiss me.”

“...Yes, ma’am.”

They got back to work, rolling over so Kyouka was on top. Kyouka’s jack went over to the bedside table, opening the drawer and tapping around inside. She groaned, with Izuku asking with her lips against her neck, “What?”

Kyouka’s jack moved back over to them to show Izuku, her jack stabbed into a little cardboard box that they had colored over with marker in case anyone went snooping around in their rooms, “We’re out…”

Izuku looked over, brow raised. He clicked his tongue once he realized what she was talking about, “...Oh.” 

Kyouka sighed, her jack slinging the box into the trashcan next to the nightstand, “I knew I should’ve started the pill.”

Izuku chuckled as he sat up against the wall, “We’re probably going to be called for soon anyway.”

“Are you kidding me?” Kyouka scoffed as she sat down next to him, leaning her head on his shoulder. “It’s Saturday. Everyone knows Aizawa doesn’t get up before noon.”

“Yeah, but what do you think he values more? Sleep or punishing students?”

“Yikes. Good point. What are we gonna tell him anyway?”

Izuku blew a raspberry, “I don’t know. I trust him, of course. But, I mean…”

“I get it. And, I think he’ll get it too. Not knowing, I mean. He might not like being left in the dark, but I think Aizawa when something personal is actually *personal.* As long as we make it clear that it’s a private matter, he won’t push it. Thankfully, we both know Bakugou will keep his mouth shut for once in his life. Not to stay out of trouble, but because he’d rather die than admit Deku beat his ass.”

“Hmhmhm, there is that. 

*\*Bzzzt\**

Both of their phones vibrated, meaning it was probably from their group chat with All Might. Which, unfortunately also meant they were being summoned. Kyouka reached over and grabbed her phone, showing the message to Izuku.

**\[All Might\]:** Aizawa and I will be waiting in the teacher’s lounge in thirty minutes. I’ll grab Young Bakugou a little early so you don't run into him on the way there. Also, Aizawa was gonna come and get all three of you from your rooms. I convinced him not to, because I have a strong feeling one of you didn't sleep in your respective room. As your teacher, I don’t condone this hypothetical. As someone who is classified as friend/family? You’re welcome.

Kyouka shook her head as she put her phone down, “He knows too much.”

“Well, if he didn’t know too much, then Aizawa probably would’ve seen I don’t sleep in my own room, so I’m definitely thankful.” Izuku sighed as he got out of bed, stretching out as he walked towards the bathroom. “Might as well get this over with.”

We do have half-an-hour.” Kyouka blushed a little, throwing her legs over the edge of the bed. “If we need to get ready and save some time, is it a morning shower day?”

Izuku chuckled as he reached the bathroom, “Trying to test our iron wills?”

“Can’t have sex…” Kyouka got up, walking past Izuku as her jack wrapped around his waist to drag him with her, "Plenty of other things we can do.”

  
  
  

***~...AMP…~***

  
  
  

**(** **Tokyo: HPSC Headquarters: Madam President’s Office** **)**

  
  

“You’re absolutely sure?”

Hawks raised a brow at his boss, her silhouette in front of her window as the morning sun shone into her office. This room was always so weird to him. Gray walls, blue floors, bookshelves on one side of the wall, and pictures of past presidents on the other. Pretty standard stuff, but there was absolutely nothing personal. No family photos, plants, trinkets, nothing. Just so…cold. Lifeless. He crossed his legs in his seat, shaking the fur lining of his jacket, “I’m still trying clean stains of ‘Lady Nagant’ off of my clothes, so you tell me.”

Madam President bit the inside of her cheek as she continued to stare out the window, her fist clenching behind her back. “...She’s putting him on to us.”

Hawks peered at her, “Shigaraki?”

“All Might,” she shook her head. “She’s getting his attention, making him suspicious. We need to stop her before she makes contact with him. If All Might turns against us, we might as well turn ourselves in now.”

“Turn ourselves in? I mean, everything we do is for the people. All Might would understand, right?”

Madam President unclenched her fist, turning back to Hawks with her stoicism returned, “...Under different circumstances, perhaps. However, he and Ms. Tsutsumi were very close.”

Hawks’ brows raised, pursing his lips, “Oooh…They were fuckin’.”

She deadpanned at him, turning back to the window, “To our knowledge, they weren’t in a relationship. But, I suppose we can’t be sure. All that matters is they were working together for many years. All Might will be far quicker to take her side than listen to reason. Most people aren’t taught how to properly differentiate between emotion and logic. You’ll need to keep an eye on him, but keep your distance. Whatever she has planned, she’ll go for him eventually.”

“Got it,” Hawks nodded as he stood up, “You might wanna get away from the windows though.”

Madam President shook her head, “She’s out to humiliate us first. Draw us into the light. We need to keep her in the dark.”

“And, if I do see her?”

“...It was my decision not to have her executed. I felt sorry for her. My predecessor’s methods were foolish, and she was caught in it. Now, she’s taken my good will and thrown it back in my face. When you find her…” She looked back over her shoulder, her cold eyes meeting Hawks’. “...Correct my mistake.” 

“...Yes, ma’am.” Hawks turned around, leaving the president to her thoughts.

Something did stick out to him, though. He basically had Nagant’s old job, right? If so, why were the past president’s decisions so foolish? Sure, he didn’t run around killing other Pros, but…

Well, Nagant was technically a Pro, so…

But, this was different. She was putting everyone in jeopardy by trying to destroy the HPSC. They weren’t perfect, but they didn’t need to be eradicated. He supposed he’d also be pretty pissed if he was sent to jail while everyone else’s crimes were covered up. 

Hawks shook his head as he opened the door, taking his leave. At the end of the day, Tsutsumi made her choices.

He had a job to do.

**(** **Thirty Minutes Later: Outside UA Teacher’s Lounge** **)**

  
  

The couple exited the elevator, turning right towards the teacher’s lounge. They walked the halls, their footsteps echoing throughout the empty school. Kyouka was in black ripped-jeans and combat boots, a white, form-fitting turtleneck shirt, spiked bracelet, and a short, dark brown cargo jacket.  

She was so happy it was autumn. All of her favorite clothes were way too hot for summer.

She glanced over at Izuku, taking in his outfit. Black jeans, t-shirt with the patterns of All Might’s Silver Age costume, and the black denim jacket she bought him.

“It’s almost Fall. I should take you shopping for warmer clothes.”

“So, by that you mean take me shopping for more black, punk clothes.”

“Perhaps…” Kyouka side-eyed him.

“And, you also mean that we’ll spend two hours browsing through your laptop because you won’t wanna go to the actual stores.”

“Do *you* wanna go shopping around tons of people, Mr. Introvert?”

“No, Mrs. Introvert.”

“That’s what I thought. Besides, we fight for what’s right, no matter what the higher-ups say. That’s pretty punk.”

“I don’t think Aizawa will like that argument,” Izuku chuckled.

“Bah, we’ll be fine. We’ll be a whole lot better than…” Kyouka cut herself off as they turned the final corner, finding Katsuki sitting at one of the benches under the windows, maybe five-to-ten meters from the teacher’s lounge door. He didn’t look up at them, continuing to stare at the wall across from him. 

Apparently their voices carried throughout the halls, because Aizawa opened the door and stepped out, turning to his students. He nodded inside, “You two, it’s your turn.”

Kyouka mumbled, *“I’m starting to hate that phrase.”*

They walked past Bakugou, heading into the teacher’s lounge. All Might was already inside, leaning on the windowsill, his arms crossed. Once the door closed behind them, the couple sat down on one of the couches, with Aizawa sitting across from them. 

“Let’s run through this one more time; from the very beginning. I’ve already asked Bakugou what happened, so your story better match his one-for-one.”

“...I’ll explain,” Kyouka volunteered, sighing through her nose. “We were all celebrating on the first floor. When Izuku and I went to throw away our trash in the kitchen, Bakugou walked by us and told Izuku to meet him at Ground Beta after curfew. He didn’t elaborate or explain what he wanted, but we could make a decent guess that he wanted to confront Izuku in one way or another. Probably a fight, saying that he wanted to meet at one of the training grounds, specifically the one where he lost to Izuku during the first Battle Training. I told Izuku not to go, and he agreed. But, we both knew Bakugou would take that for an answer. He’d just try again and again, or come for Izuku in another way. And, there was always the one-percent chance that what he actually had to say was important in some way. So, I went instead. To hear him out, sure. But, it was mainly to tell him to leave us the hell alone. I’m not gonna sit here and act like I don’t hate him, so I can’t lie and say things didn’t get heated. After a while I started insulting him, yelling at him, stuff like that.”

All Might nodded, “So, coming from you, you dissected him to the core.”

“You know me,” Kyouka couldn’t help but crack a little smile, but wiped it away quickly. “But, he didn’t take too kindly to that, and blasted me out of the way. It wasn’t big, so I don’t think it was really meant to hurt me. But, I snapped and punched him. Yes, I hate him. I wanted to hit him. I’ve wanted to hit him for a long time. But, he was still adamant on going to get Izuku, and that was my main reason to stop him. I didn’t go there for a fight. But, there’s something else too…He also claims to know where Izuku’s power came from.”

Aizawa and Toshinori glanced at each other, brows raised. Aizawa leaned forward, his voice low, “How?”

“Context clues, I guess,” Kyouka shrugged. “He kind of pieced it together on his own. He’s known Izuku since they were really little, so he couldn’t be convinced that Izuku wasn’t quirkless. He’s already heard other people like Shoto compare Izuku’s powers to All Might. And, unfortunately, Shigaraki gave away some pretty big clues while we were trying to save him. He never outright said it, and he mostly covered Bakugou’s ears, but it was enough. So, after hearing that, I *really* didn’t want him talking to Izuku. He couldn’t get the chance.”

“Shigarki covered his ears?” Toshinori raised a brow, crossing his arms. “Why would he care about keeping our secret? If it’s bad for us, why wo-...Sorry. Topic for another day. I’m assuming you denied everything?”

“Of course,” Kyouka nodded. “Called him crazy, poked holes in his theory where I could, gave him at least a shadow of a doubt.”

“Good,” Aizawa sighed in relief. “Well done. Deny, deny, deny. Don’t let his theory lead him anywhere, we stop him in his tracks. Not that I believe Bakugou would ever jeopardize us, but this little group of ours has already expanded by a lot in a short amount of time. He doesn’t need to know.” 

“Young Izuku,” Toshinori caught his attention, noticing Izuku had been silent almost the entire time. “You’ve known him for a very long time. I know you two have a very complicated history, and you don’t think too highly of him right now. If he doesn’t let up, and continues to push on this topic-”

“No,” Izuku cut him off. He shook his head, resting his elbows on his knees. “No. Certainly not now. He wouldn’t give up our secret, he’d die first…But, no.”

“It’s unanimous then,” Aizawa continued. “Back to the topic at hand then. Your story matches Bakugou’s, and he’s already taken the blame for everything. But, that doesn’t mean you two are off the hook. UA punishing students for fighting has always been…complicated. It’s up to the homeroom teachers, but Nezu encouraged us to not take a zero-tolerance policy with it. Since we’re a school that makes our hormone-charged, frontal-lobe lacking students fight each other on a regular basis, we should expect this. Bakugou was always under watch, especially after his moments during the apprehension testing and the Battle Trials. Those were his first two strikes. I thought he might be getting better, reigning himself in as the year went on. He actually handled himself well during the midterms, working together with Koda. I suppose I got my hopes too high…”

“Don’t expel him,” Izuku cut in again. 

Aizawa raised a brow, staring silently for a moment before continuing. “I’m not saying I will or I won’t, but are you willing to explain why?”

“A lot of reasons. M-Many of them personal, but…” Izuku sighed, shrugging his shoulders as he looked back up at Aizawa, “I don’t think it’s right to try and block someone from their dreams. People can change, even him. He makes it very hard to believe, trust me. But, he’s here to learn, right? You’re here to teach, but you’re a hero too. You help. I think he needs help. I don’t know from who, but I’ve tried enough. If last night didn’t kickstart something, then I don’t know what will, but he at least needs a chance to try. No one deserves to just be thrown to the side.”

Aizawa sat in deep thought, looking at Izuku. Izuku knew he had no actual power here, but he knew his teacher’s attitude was at least partially a facade. He cared; he cared a whole lot. Izuku hoped he could speak to that part of Aizawa, tip the scales more in its favor. 

“Are you at all comfortable sharing any part of the history between you two? Anything that might give me a better understanding as to why everything went down the way that it did?”

“...He hated me. You’re smart enough to figure out what for, and how the rest probably panned out. You’ve seen and heard enough throughout the year.”

“...” Aizawa eventually sighed, getting up and walking towards the door. He opened it, leaning out and finding Katsuki still sitting down the hall. “Come in here.”

The blonde glanced up, nodding silently as he stood. He made his way down the hall and into the room, Aizawa closing the door behind him. He didn’t dare sit on the same couch as the couple, so he opted to just sit in one of the chairs next to it. None of them looked at each other, merely watching their teacher return to the couch across from them and awaiting punishment.

“Let’s just start with you, Problem Children. While you two responded to the situation in the wrong way, you didn’t start this fight. Your relationship also muddles things, causing emotions to run even higher than normal, both of you instantly coming to the defense of the other…” Aizawa sighed, dragging a hand down his face. He promised himself that they wouldn’t receive any bias, and he was sticking to that. The situation was just so damn complicated, even without the One For All stuff mixed in. But, he knew these kids. The Problem Children might live up to their name in most scenarios, but he knew they would never have participated in this fight under normal circumstances. They didn’t want a fight in the first place. Kyouka went to defend Izuku, and Izuku retaliated out of seeing his loved one hurt. It was difficult to be mad when he understood why they did what they did. He had to make a decision. He had to be fair, but he also couldn’t hinder the studies of the two most important students at UA. That aspect was simply out of his control. “...A week of after-school detention.”

“Yes, sir.” The couple responded simultaneously. They knew that by Aizawa-standards, they were getting off pretty lightly, and decided not to push their luck further. 

Aizawa then looked over at Bakugou, shaking his head as the blonde didn’t meet his eyes, “Your temper and your ego have already put you on thin ice all year, but this? You already failed your License Exam because of it. Then, you try to drag Midoriya out for a fight. You *attack* Jirou out of irritation. You cause catastrophic damage to the training grounds. Every last part of this story is spawned from your immaturity and insecurity. If I had known you would get this bad, I never would’ve let you walk through UA’s doors. I’m aware enough to understand that things for everyone have been stressful, both in school and for the entire country. I know you recently went through something horrible, and I blame myself for letting you be taken in the first place. Perhaps I’ve gone soft, or perhaps I feel like I owe you. But, I’m giving you one last chance. You won’t be expelled…yet.”

Katsuki looked back up, shock flashing in his eyes before he looked back down, nodding his head before replying quietly, “Thanks.”

“I’d hold off on thanking me. I won’t expel you yet, but it’s clear to me that you don’t understand what it is we’re trying to teach you here. You don’t understand what it means to be a hero. Not yet. It’s a good thing you didn’t pass the exam, cause you’re not ready for a license. You’re not entering the remedial courses, and you’re not retaking the exam. You want to act like a child, then you don’t get adult responsibility. We’ll see if you’ve learned your lesson when you take the exams again as a second-year. You’ll have plenty of time to think about it as you spend the next month in after-school detention. Now, get out. You’ll be hearing from your parents soon.”

Katsuki was the first to move, getting up out of his chair and leaving the room without another word. 

Now alone, Izuku turned back to his teacher, “Can we hold off on the whole ‘calling the parents’ thing?”

Aizawa blinked a couple times, just staring at him. Even Kyouka was surprised at the request. “Are you kidding me?”

“The reasoning for the fight is mine to tell,” Izuku continued. “Not here, not now. I know my mom wants a dinner together to celebrate getting our licenses. I’ll do it then. Might soften the blow a little bit too. I know you said there wouldn’t be any exceptions for us as students, but I’m not asking you as a student. I’m asking you as myself. This is for me to explain, but at the right time, and in the right way. I know I’m-”

“Just…” Aizawa put his hand up to stop him, using his other hand to pinch the bridge of his nose. “Fine. Do whatever you have to do. Saves me the trouble of dealing with more parents anyway.”

“Thank you, sir.”

“You won’t be thanking me soon enough. Your after-school detention will involve training under me all week. So, get to Recovery Girl, Jirou. I’m not taking no for an answer this time.”

“Yes, sir.” Kyouka got up, Izuku following her example. 

Before they could leave, Toshinori caught their attention. “E-Eh, actually, speaking of parents. I figured you should probably hear this from me before he tells you, I just figured last night was a really bad time. But, you might get a call, or you might hear it at that dinner, but I’m…kinda, maybe, *sorta* working with your father on a case.”

Aizawa did a double-take, peering at his coworker, “A case? You mean about last night?”

“Last night?” the couple asked simultaneously.

The teachers glanced at each other, with Aizawa answering, “Didn’t check the news this morning, I take it?”

“Last night, at the charity gala…I was shot at.” Toshinori reached into his breast pocket, placing something down on the coffee table. “With this.”

The couple looked down at the little ball on the table, with Izuku’s eyes widening as he instantly recognized the pink and indigo swirls. He looked back up at All Might incredulously, “...You asked my dad to help you with Lady Nagant?”

“...A little bit.”

Kyouka pinched the bridge of her nose, sitting back down, “Oh for the love of all that’s holy…” 

Aizawa glanced around at them all, still confused, “Why does that name sound familiar?”

“Now we have to catch him up,” Kyouka groaned, throwing her hand out towards Aizawa.

“It’s a long story, we’ll tell you later,” Toshinori told Aizawa. “But, I need Mr. Midoriya’s help. He’s all I got.”

Izuku was still processing, mouth opening and closing as he tried to think of what to say. “Wh-...You-...You know he *works* for the HPSC, right?”

“Exactly,” Toshinori nodded. “The only way this can work is if we get proof, and Midoriya is our only way to get it.”

“If there’s any proof at all,” Kyouka countered. “Government cover-ups, remember?”

“Just humor me, alright? If there is anything, our only hope of finding it is with someone on the inside. Stuff like this is his job, he’ll know exactly what to look for. Not to mention, it’s completely above board. He has access to everything we need. No breaking and entering, no stealing keycards to restricted areas-”

“This isn’t a spy thriller!” Izuku threw his arms up. “This is my dad’s job! His life!”

“I-I know. I’m sorry,” Toshinori put his hands up, trying to calm him down. “My boy, you know I would never take this so lightly. But, I-...He’s my only hope of getting Kaina the justice she deserves. I’ve been stuck on this for so long. If you truly don’t want this, I’ll call it off. But, without him, I truly don’t know what to do…”

Izuku sighed, dragging his hand down his face. He knew that, in reality, he had no power or right to be against any of this. Both All Might and Hisashi were adults, and fighting corruption was their job. 

It was just…scary. 

Both he and All Might would be in the crosshairs of a clearly powerful group…

“...So, a government coup?” All heads turned back to Aizawa, admittedly forgetting he was even there. “You’re all staging a government coup?”

They all looked at each other, with Toshinori answering, “Not against the whole government. Just a small, specific group of people within the HPSC.”

“So, our employers? And, by ‘our’, I mean every hero.”

“Y-...Yes?”

Aizawa blinked a couple times, sighing as he got up and moved towards the little kitchen area in the corner of the room. He opened up the top cabinet, took out a mug, and moved over to the coffee pot to pour. While pouring, he used his free hand to nudge the fridge forward a bit, revealing a bottle of scotch taped to the back of the fridge. He ripped it off, set the mug aside, and proceeded to pour the scotch directly into the coffee pot and drink from it. 

They all watched with wide eyes as he chugged it down, not even asking if it was still boiling hot or not. 

He drank every last drop, setting the pot down and picking his mug back up. He turned around, leaning on the counter, “...Okay.”

Toshinori stood there, mouth agape, not quite sure how to respond. “O-...Okay?”

“It’s unironically one of the least crazy things you’ve ever said to me. So, yes. Okay. You owe Nemuri a bottle of scotch, though.” He turned to Izuku, gesturing his mug towards Toshinori. “He’s an immunity card.”

Izuku’s brow knit together, “What?”

“You’re scared for your father, I get it. But, whatever this is all about, I do know one thing. The HPSC would *never* touch All Might. *Ever.* They would rather out themselves to every ounce of dirty laundry they have, than lose All Might. Their only Hail Mary hope would be to frame him as a martyr, but now that he’s retired, that’s out of the question. Even if he wasn’t, that would be the big, red button they would never want to touch. As long as he’s with All Might, they won’t touch him.”

Izuku bit the inside of his cheek, nodding his head, “Yeah…”

“And, whatever it is, you want to do it. That bastard over there is crazy, but there’s a reason he chose you. You’re just as insane, if not more. If your father wasn’t a part of the equation, you wouldn’t even hesitate. But, if it makes you feel any better, your father’s kind of a hero.”

“Wh-...What?”

“Willing to go against his own government, risks included, all for the sake of doing what he thinks is right? He’s also crazy, but you had to inherit it from somewhere.” Aizawa the turned to Toshinori, jabbing his mug towards him. “ *You* are gonna explain everything, and then you’re gonna explain why you kept this from me. Circle of Trust, my ass.”

*\*Bzzzt\** 

Toshinori pulled out his phone, checking his messages. The most recent one was Hisashi, saying he was in the parking lot. 

…And quite a few ones from Ryuko he had missed. Shit.

He hadn’t seen her since he dropped her off at home last night, so focused on the fact that Kaina had escaped that he barely heard what she was talking about. He didn’t mean to, it was just so much to process.

Any suspicions he might’ve had were completely eradicated the moment Ryuko told the police that the person she fought was a woman with short, indigo, and pink hair.

She was adamant on staying with Toshinori for the night, just in case. But, he managed to convince her that he would be fine under UA’s watch. Which was true, but it was mainly an excuse to go meet with Hisashi. 

“Gonna have to take a raincheck on that. I gotta go,” Toshinori pocketed his phone, moving towards the door.

“Wh-? Where are you going?”

“Detective work!” Toshinori called over his shoulder, jogging out into the hall. “I’ll explain when I get back!”

They listened to his footsteps grow quieter, leaving them all guessing. Kyouka blew a raspberry, getting up from the couch, “Forgive him. This whole thing means a lot to him. We could explain if you want?”

“Just…” Aizawa put his hand up, stopping them. He shook his head, pinching the bridge of his nose. “I need a breather. It’s been non-stop for the last twenty-four hours. We’ll pick this back up when he gets back. We’ll start your training then.”

They both nodded, deciding it was probably better to leave before the truly strict side of Aizawa decided to come back. The couple left their teacher to decompress, going back into the hall and heading towards the elevator. 

As the doors closed, Izuku ran both hands down his face as he leaned back against the wall. Kyouka leaned into him, using her jack to push his face to look at her. “He’s gonna be just fine. Aizawa’s right, All Might is an immunity card. Even if something does happen, he has us and Aizawa. Nothing’s stopped us before.”

“...Yeah, I know. And, All Might has a point. My dad really might be our best chance at finding proof. I just didn’t expect all this to start coming to a head so suddenly, especially after yesterday. All Might and my dad working together is certainly…a thing. I didn’t think he’d already be getting so interwoven in all of our…”

“Bullshit?”

“Yeah, that’s it. He and my mom shouldn’t have to deal with all of our crap, but I guess at the same time I chose this life. It was gonna bleed into theirs eventually. It already did a long time ago, in hindsight.”

“He’s still in the dark about the biggest piece of bullshit. But, when he tells you that he’s working with All Might, are you gonna act surprised? Or, are you gonna lay it all out for him?”

“...He’s gotta know eventually.”

“Yeah, he does. In my personal opinion, keeping it from him doesn’t protect him. It probably makes it more dangerous. For others, it’s different, but he’s family.”

“I know,” Izuku sighed. “...The dinner then. We’ll throw it all out there.”

“It’s gonna be a lot to throw at him.”

“Do you want one tense social interaction or multiple, Mrs. Introvert?”

“Yeesh, point taken, Mr. Introvert.” The elevator doors opened, letting them off on the first floor. They stepped out, making their way to the school entrance. “On the bright side, Aizawa let us off easy.”

“You consider training with Aizawa easy.”

“Pfft, not at all. But, he was already gonna train us to death. All he did was add a few extra days. This is a wrist slap, and he knows it. This was basically his way of letting us off with a warning while still technically punishing us. Aizawa is smart enough to put together that part of your lashing out was due to your history with Bakugou. This is his weird way of showing empathy, saying that he understands. If anyone could humanize Aizawa, it’s you.”

Izuku chuckled, “I’m happy my trauma works miracles.”

“You know what I meant,” Kyouka nudged him.

“Hmhmhm, I know,” Izuku smiled as he put his arm around her waist. 

“Hey, he’s waiting for us, by the way. Near the entrance.”

Izuku sighed, “Yeah, I figured.”

They rounded one more corner, arriving at the front foyer of UA, rows of lockers lining up in front of the entrance. They left the building, finding Katsuki sitting on one of the many benches lining the path leading to the school.

“Hey…” He stood up, face neutral and hands stuffed in his pockets. Kyouka sneered at him, mouth opening, but Izuku instantly put his hand on her wrist. She stopped herself, conceding to Izuku’s silent plea. He just stared back at Bakugou, not saying anything to even dignify his call to them. Katsuki shifted his eyes around, taking a deep breath, “I-...I’m sorry.”

Kyouka was so close to biting back again, but she reigned herself in. Izuku wanted to handle it, so he’d handle it. Unless he forgave him, in which case she would say something. She loved him and would do anything for him, but that also included snapping some sense into him.

“...Was I ever actually your friend?”

Both Kyouka and Katsuki were taken aback by that, with the latter peering at him, “Wh-...What?”

“I’ve thought about it for a long time, and I have my answer. But, I’ve never had the chance to actually ask you. At least, not a chance where you wouldn’t immediately burn or hit me for having the audacity to speak to you.” Katsuki cringed, but either Izuku didn’t notice or didn’t care. “You see how friends act, how normal people treat each other. You have some yourself, surprisingly. I suppose I can’t say I don’t get it, with how long I followed you around. Did you ever consider me to be even slightly on the level of the people you begrudgingly hang around here at UA? Before everything, before my diagnosis…Was I ever actually your friend?”

The silence that permeated between the three of them was unnerving. Katsuki uncomfortably looked to the side, but he could feel Izuku’s eyes burning into him, unwavering, awaiting an answer he already knew. He just wanted Katsuki to say it out loud, to finally admit to something for once in his life. 

Katsuki didn’t look back at Izuku, an action that him from twenty-four hours ago would’ve called him fucking pathetic for. He slightly shook his head, “...No.”

It was probably the quietest the couple had ever heard Katsuki’s voice go. Neither teen let their expressions show anything other than stoicism. 

Izuku finally responded, his voice flat, “I thought so. It’s nice that you’re sorry, even if you don’t understand what it means and are only saying it because you have a slight understanding that it’s what you should do. I just don’t think we should be around each other. Until you understand…You can be sorry far, far away from me.”

Katsuki was silent, not particularly sure what else he was expecting. All this shit was just…

He didn’t know.

He could still see that lingering disdain in Izuku’s eyes, his already mixed opinions of Katsuki turned even worse. But, above all else, he could see…Pity. After all these years, it came back full circle. 

It was truly a mystery how every single time he saw Earlobes, she came up with a new way to look like she hated him even more. She looked like she wanted to kill him. Saying that she probably heard every word Izuku had said, it made sense. That is, if he didn’t tell her all that a long time ago. 

He didn’t know what to say. There probably wasn’t anything to say anyway. 

Katsuki simply watched as they turned away from him, walking back towards the dorms. He sat back down on the bench, deciding to spare them all the awkwardness of heading back to the dorms even somewhat close to one another. 

He didn’t understand? Did they really think he wasn’t sorry? Why couldn’t for all those years, the bastard just say someth-...

What the fuck was he thinking? He really was fucked up. 

Katsuki was so lost in his own mind, he didn’t hear one of the doors to the entrance open up. He sat with his elbows resting on his knees, staring down the ground. A shadow suddenly entered his vision, the click of heeled boots in front of him.

“Are you alright?”

Katsuki glanced up, seeing some chick he didn’t know. She looked vaguely familiar. Maybe from 1B or something? Long hair of green, thorned-vines, a long, green dress down to her ankles and a white shawl wrapped around her shoulders. She was carrying a stack of fliers, looking down at him with her brows knit together. 

Katsuki didn’t say anything, knowing that if he opened his mouth it would probably just be an insult or a dismissive jab. 

Instead, he just got up and walked away. 

  
  
  
  

***~...AMP…~***

**(** **Nearing Heights Alliance** **)**

  
  

“So, how long until everyone finds out about the fight?”

Izuku scoffed, “Uh, saying that your fight with him could probably be heard three prefectures away? They have a vague idea.”

“I’m really sorry about that,” Kyouka sighed. “I lost control for a second and I slipped. He saw my quirk go absolutely berserk.”

“It’s not like he can prove anything. Even if he’s suspicious about me, he would have no way of knowing about you, much less think it was even possible. Your quirk has gotten stronger over time, even without One For All. Sure, a lot of that was with gear, but it’s not like Bakugou pays attention to other people enough to fully know your capabilities.”

“Yeah, I guess. But, I’ll still be more careful. I can’t believe I’m gonna miss messing with him. Unless I do something indirect.”

They were nearing the porch on the side of the building, with Izuku turning back to her as he put his first foot on the steps, “What do you mean?”

“I mean, stuff like drinking all of the coffee before he gets any. Or, when it’s our turn for the dorm chores, we take everyone’s trash except his.”

“...So, petty stuff.”

Kyouka scoffed, putting her hand on her chest as she stared in faux offense, “You think so little of me?”

Izuku just smiled back, “Kyouka, you *love* being petty.”

“Only to people who are complete assholes.”

“True,” Izuku chuckled. “I can see you miss it already.”

“I’m just spit-balling! I could think of something much better.”

“Hmhmhm, I know you can. Like what?” Izuku sat down on the steps, deciding to humour her. It was admittedly kinda fun; it eased the tension. Her influence on him was truly astounding.

“...We could do it on his desk.”

“Pfft! Hahaha! Yeah, right.”

“...”

Izuku stopped laughing, looking up at her with brows raised, “...You’re joking, right?”

“Yeah, of course! That would be insane…” Kyouka shifted her eyes to the side, balancing on her heels as she clicked her tongue. “But, now that I think about it…”

“Kyouka…”

“It would honestly be one of the least crazy places we’ve done it.”

“Wh-?! What?! That *is* the craziest place!”

“Our first time having sex was on a beach. *A public beach.* Then, I negotiated with a *Pro Hero* to let us sneak into an onsen to do it again. All of this was while on a school trip. I did that with zero pause.”

“I-...Huh.” Izuku really couldn’t defend any of that. Even he thought it was crazy at the time. “B-But, I don’t want to start anything else. I just want us to leave each other alone.”

“He’d never know it happened! Completely harmless,” Kyouka countered. ”We do it, clean his desk, and then he sits there and wonders why his desk— and only his desk— smells like cleaning products. It would be the ultimate crescendo of fucking with him.”

“I can’t believe I’m even capable of having this conversation, much less humor it. I’ve really changed.”

“It’s not some deep-seeded revenge, no one gets hurt. In fact, in our case, it would be the exact opposite. All the times he blew up your desk, I mean…It would only be fair. Not even that, saying that he wouldn’t even know about it. A little inside joke, just for us.”

“Kyouka, we’re already in trouble. You really want to sneak into UA at night just to have sex on my former bully’s desk?”

“...Yes.”

“...Just so we— and only we— can have the knowledge that you did it. And, just in case he pisses you off again, you can pull that trigger against him for the rest of our lives?”

“...Yes.”

“...” Izuku took a deep breath, dragging both hands down his face. “...I’ll think about it.”

Kyouka’s brows rose as she scoffed, a chuckle escaping her lips, “Izuku, I was mostly joking. We really-”

“Your window of opportunity is closing.”

“I’ll take it,” Kyouka quickly cut in. “You think on it…But, we both know that when it comes to me, you pretty much never say no.”

Izuku nodded, sighing as he turned around to enter the dorms, “We’re completely insane.”

Kyouka chuckled as she hugged his arm to her chest, walking with him. But, just as they reached the door. They walked inside, and almost instantly regretted it.

Their whole class was already awake and downstairs, spread out amongst the couches and sitting areas, most of them eating breakfast. All heads turned to them, multiple mouths already opening to ask ten-thousand questions.

Well, the tension decided it was gone too long.

“Shut up,” Kyouka instantly cut them off. “No questions. Go back to your business.”

Everyone quickly turned away, deciding not to face the wrath of Kyouka, especially since they didn’t actually know what the outcome of the fight was. For all they knew, she kicked Bakugou’s ass. 

Ochako, Tenya, Momo, and Shoto were all at one of the tables in the eating area, and were the only people still looking their way. The couple walked over to them, Izuku putting his hand on Kyouka’s lower back to get her attention, “I’m starving. You want me to make us something?”

“Yeah, sure. Anything’s fine. Thanks.”

Izuku nodded as Kyouka took her seat, looking back at his awaiting friends. “...Any reprimands from our presidents?”

Tenya shook his head, “As Class President, I clearly disapprove and think it was stupid. As your friend, I’m aware that you two definitely aren’t the one who started it, purely basing that on knowing who the third person involved was. I’m simply going to ask if you’re alright.”

“I, uh…Yeah. Surprisingly a lot better, actually.”

“Then, that’s all that matters.”

Momo just sheepishly smiled at him, “I certainly don’t condone it. But, and perhaps Kyouka has had far too much of an influence on me, but based on how he’s treated you and everyone else this year? I’m going to make a wild assumption and say he probably deserved it. A-At least, a bit.”

“Preaching to the choir,” Kyouka scoffed. 

“Kyouka…” Izuku side-eyed her, but admittedly couldn’t help but smile a little.

“You don’t have to keep talking about it, you know?” Ochako added in. “We know you don’t talk about your past much. Er, I mean, if this is about your past.”

‘Eh, yes and no,” Izuku sighed. “But…Just give me a little time. It’s long overdue that I stop hiding from it, and you all deserve to know some more about me. Don’t worry about it right though…Also, don’t go training in Ground Beta.”

Everyone then looked towards Shoto, being the only one who hadn’t said anything yet. He looked around at them, shrugging his shoulders.

“He’s an asshole,” Shoto said with a complete deadpan expression, taking a sip of his coffee. Despite not intending it to be a joke, everyone chuckled. Kyouka also had a smug smile on her face, once again proud of her influence. “I was already surprised it took Kyouka this long to punch him.”

As they all laughed again, Izuku looked around at his friends. After combing through his past last night, he had almost forgotten just how much his life had turned around. Something deep down still didn’t believe he had friends like this. 

They were still so in the dark about him. Sure, he had his secrets and moments he’d rather keep to himself and Kyouka, but even normal stuff he kept close to the chest. They deserved more. 

He’d figure out how to talk about himself a little more. It just wasn’t in his coding. Kyouka was just given a master key, so she could bypass it whenever she wanted. 

But, for now, he’d just appreciate the fact that they accepted what he did give them. 

  
  
  

***~...AMP…~***

  
  
  

**(** **Unknown Musutafu Apartment** **)**

  
  

Kaina was standing in her kitchen in a gray tank-top and purple sweats, scouring through her fridge, trying to think about what to eat. She settled on a leftover takeout carton of chicken, broccoli and rice, opening up the flap with her chopsticks as she leaned back against the counter. 

One of the upsides of the HPSC making sure everybody forgot she existed was that they didn’t plaster her face anywhere. She could go buy food without being recognized. She still wore wraps or hoods on her head, but she didn’t give much too much of a damn about cameras at this point.

*\*Knock-Knock\**

“Come i-”

The door swung open, with Twice running in, his arms flailing around, “Lady, we’ve got a big problem!”

“For fuck’s sake, Twice,” Tomura quickly stepped inside, shutting the door behind him. “Keep your voice down, man.”

“But, it’s a problem! Big problem! *Eh, it’s a small problem. No big deal.* Huge deal! We-” Twice turned around, and Kaina was suddenly in front of him. Her chopsticks grabbed his nose, yanking him down to eye-level.

“Calm. Down. Now.”

“...Yes, ma’am,” Twice replied, his voice nasally from his closed nostrils. 

She let him go, wiping her chopsticks off on her shirt as she walked back to her kitchen, “What’s the problem?”

“Your clone,” Twice answered. “It’s dead. I don’t know how, but it died this morning.”

Kaina turned back around, brow raised, “You’re sure.”

*“It’s my quirk, lady! Of course I’m sure!* Ahem, mm…Yes, I’m sure.”

Tomura stepped up next to Twice, hands in his pockets, shrugging his shoulders, “Not much we can do now. It’s not like we can send another clone.”

“Why would you?” Kaina smiled, setting her carton down. “This is just what I wanted.”

They watched as Kaina moved towards her closet, sliding open the doors and crouching down. She reached in and yanked back, making multiple boxes slide across the floor and out of the closet. As she began grabbing clothes, Tomura walked over to the boxes, looking down at the picture on the side, “Video Cameras?”

“Yep,” Kaina replied dismissively, tossing another, much smaller box on top. Tomura could see it was a double-pack of USBs. “Now, I've gotta get dressed, so there’s the door.”

Tomura deadpanned, sending a quick text to Kurogiri before turning to Twice and nodding towards the door, “Go ahead, I’ll follow in a sec.”

“Yes, boss!” Twice saluted, marching away as a black portal opened up in front of him. 

Once Twice was out the door, Kaina sighed, “Which is it this time? More questions about my plans, or more questions about your moral crises?” 

“Advice,” Tomura pocketed his hands, lazily pacing back and forth. “You ever deal with the Yakuza?”

Kaina furrowed her brow, crossing her arms as she scoffed, “Those has-beens? Sure, like ten years ago or something. If you’re thinking about taking them over, I promise you it’s not worth it. It wouldn’t even be scraps. The Yakuza have been nothing but ghosts for centuries. Any members that think they have any sort of influence are just delusional. Hell, if you took them down, it wouldn’t even make front page news.”

“Yeah, well we’re not exactly doing so well in numbers either. It’s mostly because I’ve heard some rumors that have piqued my interest. But, like you said, they’re old. Which means they’re old school. I was taught to never walk into a meeting unarmed, whether that be a literal weapon or any sort of information or deal you can use against them. I suppose I’m just wondering what you might know about them, given your experience in taking them down.”

Kaina stared at him for a few seconds before returning to her closet, scanning over her wardrobe, “You wanna do the world a favor? You say you wanna change the world? Make it better? Get rid of ‘em.”

Tomura couldn’t help but chuckle a bit, “You’re just hoping we’ll all kill each other.”

“You said it, not me.”

“I thought you were sworn off killing?”

“Oh, I’ll do my very best for the rest of my life not to kill another soul. But, can’t stop the sun from rising and setting, can’t stop the Earth from spinning, and you can’t stop humans killing each other for an infinite smorgasbord of reasons. There is no dealing with the Yakuza. They’re an old, washed-up dragon constantly trying to eat its own tail, never realizing it was cut off centuries ago. But, even still, they’re trouble. But, not enough trouble for them to be on anyone’s priority list. They’re not scary. They’re just…sad.”

“Mm, you’re not wrong. But, I’ve heard there’s a new guy in charge. He’s apparently been making some moves…”

“Then he’s writing their death sentence,” Kaina shook her head, leaning back against the closet door. “The Yakuza have only survived so long by being quiet. If he decides to bring any form of attention to them, they’ll be completely dead and buried by the end of the year. The sheer amount of heroes completely outmatches the Yakuza. Unless they’ve got some ultimate trump card, it’s over. Don’t bother dealing with them.”

“I don’t exactly have a lot of options right now,” Tomura shrugged. “They’ve apparently been working on something. Some quirk enhancement drug. I at least want to see what that’s all about, see if it’s viable, see if it could actually be helpful. But, I’ll consider what you said. If things start turning for the worse, I’ll pull out of there. If they don’t like that, then I’ll do everyone a solid and take them down.”

“So confident in your army of seven people.”

“You just said to take them down!”

Kaina slumped her shoulders as she rolled her eyes, “Listen, kid. They’re not licking their wounds. They’re permanently crippled. They’re just as weak and desperate as you are. If you push them, they’ll attack; no doubt about it. But, they’ll do everything to avoid losing any more of their already laughably small amount of men and resources. A single fight would cost them greatly. They need things to go well just as much as you do. Just play everything by the book, and you’ll be fine.”

“Hm…Okay then. Why the sudden switch-up? Besides to get me to leave, obviously.”

“Because…” Kaina sighed, turning back to Tomura. “I don’t actually want anyone to die, alright? I just want all this bullshit to be over, even though I know that’s a fruitless request. I’ve caused enough death, kid. Look, you confuse the ever-living shit outta me, but I don’t think you’re *entirely* evil. I couldn’t have been that much older than you when I got into my mess. I guess…I don’t know. Just take the advice and leave me the fuck alone.”

“Ah, she’s back. Almost had me worried there.” Tomura pulled out his phone, sending another text Kurogiri’s way. A portal swirled open near the front door, Tomura walking towards it. “I’m sure your old flame taught you otherwise, but not everyone can be saved…Some of us don’t wanna be saved.”

She watched as he disappeared through the vortex, leaving her alone in her apartment.

**(** **Thirty-Minutes Later: Musutafu HPSC Building Parking Lot** **)**

  
  

Toshinori leaned forward in the passenger’s seat, looking up at the looming dark building, “Are you sure we don’t need to go to Tokyo?”

“Nah,” Hisashi shook his head, looking in the sun visor mirror as he readjusted his tie and brushed down his black suit. “Our servers are all interconnected. If there’s any information left behind, it’ll be in our system. There won’t be anything damning, but hopefully there will just be small details that add up.”

“And, you’re sure you don’t want me to come with you?”

Hisashi shook his head as he unclipped his seatbelt, “You draw way too much attention. I’ll go by unnoticed. If I need you to come in, you’ll be the perfect distraction. As far as anyone is concerned, I’m just looking into some old files for an investigation. Take these.”

Hisashi pulled out a small, smooth, silver case, handing it to All Might. “These earbuds?”

“Bought you some this morning. Connect them to your phone and call me, I’ll have my own in. I figured it would be better if you hear if something happens, rather than me trying to send you a panicked text.”

“Hm, not bad. Almost like this kinda stuff is your job or something,” Toshinori chuckled, opening the bluetooth menus on his phone. “Do you think they’ll have her name tagged? Like, it’ll alert someone that her files were accessed?”

“It’s possible, but it’s not gonna matter much, is it? If this goes how we want, this’ll go public. They’ll know it was us. Let’s just hope she was so long and forgotten that they never bothered. Alright, I’ll be back soon. If I call for you, the elevator is right in the front lobby, and the stairs are past the front desk. I’ll be three floors down.”  

“Got it,” Toshinori nodded. “I’m still not used to this. Being on the sidelines, I mean.”

“A-Ah, well…You’ve done everything for thirty years. It’s far past time for guys like me to start putting in some work too.”

“What? C’mon, you’ve been doing your part for years now.”

“I-I’ve seen some stuff, but espionage and action like this?” Hisashi took a shaky breath, opening the car door. “I guess I just couldn’t pass up the chance to be a real hero for once.”

Toshinori watched as he got out of the car with a furrowed brow, “...Thank you.”

Hisashi leaned back down, hand on the roof of the car as he shrugged, “Are you kidding? I get to work with All Might. I should be *paying* you for this.”

“Pfft. I’m sure this wasn't what you were dreaming about,” Toshinori chuckled. 

“Ah, maybe not, but hopefully it’ll still impress Izuku.”

“...Young Midoriya will be very proud of you, I’m sure.”

“Yeah? W-Well…I hope so. Who do you think inspired me to do this?” 

He put his satchel on his shoulder and shut the door, and Toshinori watched as he began weaving through other parked cars and heading towards the building. He lowered his seat down, just in case anyone looked his way. 

When he heard Izuku’s father was coming home, the last thing he expected was to be starring in his own buddy cop movie with him. It was actually fun, despite how serious it was. It reminded him of all the investigations he and Kaina went on, back in the day. 

Everything since last night had been going so fast that Toshinori hadn’t thought about what he was gonna do if all this actually worked. 

Where would Kaina go? She needed somewhere to live, her apartment was sold long ago. 

Of course, he’d offer for her to stay with him, but he wasn’t sure how Ryuko would feel about th-...

Oooooh fuck. 

He still hadn’t messaged her back. Could he tell her about all this? Surely he could explain that Kaina was just a friend, right? There was nothing there…

…Even in his own mind it sounded like a lie. 

Toshinori shook his head, he had to focus. The mission was of utmost importance over anything. Not just for Kaina, but for all of Japan itself.

He connected the earbuds, and called Hisashi.

Hisashi stepped out of the elevator, walking out into the records section. He pulled black, latex gloves out of his bag and put them on. He felt his phone vibrate in his pocket, tapping his earbud to answer the call. 

*“You in?”*

“Yep, and thankfully schedules haven’t changed since I’ve been gone, because it seems empty down here. Hold on, I’ll get to a computer.”

Rows and rows of ten-foot tall shelves lining the maroon walls, almost going up to the high ceiling, going down what felt like half a kilometer. With the black marble tiles and new context of the HPSCs dirty laundry, the color scheme almost made it look like an evil lair. 

He walked down the room, the sound of his feet hitting the tiles bouncing off the walls. He made sure to come in early. He remembered the people who ran records didn’t come in until later in the morning, so he had about an hour to search unabated.

Hisashi still didn’t want to be out in the open, so once he made it to the large, circular hub desk in the middle of the room, he turned left, making his way into one of the computer rooms. He slid his card into the reader, the red light flashing green as it unlocked. Once he was done, he’d go into the system and try to erase his latest keycard usage and log-in from the system’s history. 

It wouldn’t do much, but it might buy him some time if they actually did have Nagant’s name tagged.

The computers were lined up against the walls, so Hisashi moved to the far corner to be out of sight in case someone peeked in. 

As he began to type, he heard Toshinori ask, *“So, what exactly are we looking for here?”*

“Well, obviously there’s not gonna be any logs of targets or orders to kill. We need the stuff that they couldn’t change without raising suspicion. The murder of the chairman was a surprise to them, and odds are they panicked. Everything surrounding Nagant and the murder would look extremely bad for them, so they probably tried to wrap things up fast. Hopefully, that means they had far more opportunities to make mistakes and let things slip. They were scrambling, leaderless, all in the dead of night when he was killed.”

*“Alright, so what couldn’t they change?”*

“Public knowledge stuff, or anything that could be investigated if it looked wrong. They had to keep all of Nagant’s invoices and documents. The HPSC was already worried about their image. The last thing they wanted was to also have the National Tax Agency come knocking down their doors.”

*“Hmhmhm, the one thing I fear more than All For One.”*

“Who?”

*“Wh-? A-Ah, that’s the name of the villain I fought at Kamino.”*

“Oh, really? Interesting name…”

*“Yeah, I know. But, he clearly isn’t sane, so there’s no telling what he was thinking.”*

“Mm, fair enough.”

*“Anyway, can you really access stuff like others’ payments? That’s not your department.”*

“Anything that can be a part of an internal investigation is my department. Sure, usually I need permission, but after all these years I can work some magic. Like riiight…now.” Hisashi hit enter, every file with Kaina’s name appearing as a list on screen. Hisashi pulled out his USB and plugged it into the PC beneath him. “Ok…Let’s start connecting some dots.”

**(** **Some Time Later** **)**

  
  

Hisashi couldn’t tell if he should be proud of himself, or disappointed in his own employers.

Hopefully a mix of both.

He had found payments that didn’t align with the dates of the rest of them, inconsistent numbers with those same payments, payments for travel expenses that the HPSC usually didn’t cover, it went on and on. All of these were unremarkable to everyone else, seemingly typical expenses that wouldn’t make the tax man bat an eye. 

But, to someone who knew about Nagant? To someone so ingrained in the HPSC? Hisashi saw every paystub stained with blood. 

He would have to let All Might see these and check the dates for himself. If he can confirm some of these dates were when Nagant went out of town, it would be huge.

He began to print every document and copy them to his USB, moving on down the files as the printer nearby buzzed to life. 

Hisashi opened up the most recent file he could find, Nagant’s mugshot appearing as her information filled the screen. At first, there was nothing of note. Just information on her and the crime she committed. However, a note at the bottom caught his eye.

**\[Trial Date: TBA\]**

“She had no trial?”  
  

*“Mm, not that I know of.”*

“There are no dates of *any* form of court appearance or court-appointed lawyers. The date of her incarceration is the exact same as the day of the murder. Unless there was some sort of mistake on the forms, that would mean she was taken straight to Tartarus without any form of due process.”

*“Making sure she kept quiet. They couldn’t risk her speaking out in court.”*

**\[Visitation Rights: Revoked\]**

“She had her visitation rights revoked.”

*“What? What fo-...Why am I even asking? We know why.”*

“Still, every little bit matters. Hm…There are no additional charges since her incarceration, which also means she’s been on good behavior the entire time. Technically visitation is considered a privilege, not a right. But, even Tartarus gives *some* leeway in that regard. Others who had done far worse than her are still allowed visitors, even if very limited. To have visitation revoked would require a court appearance for the prisoner to make their case against it, but she has no court dates listed.”

*“...They told me she was refusing any visitors.”*

Hisashi sighed, “Odds are they never even told her you showed up. I think I’ve got what I need here. Let me jus-”

*“Hm?”*

“What?”

*“Nothing, I thought I saw something. I think it was just a bird or something…Really big bird, though.”*

Hisashi simply hummed in response as he went into the user history and deleted both his keycard and log-in from the records. He took his USB and every paper he copied, putting them in his satchel as he began to leave. 

He left the computer room, looking down to take off his gloves and-

“Good morning.”

Hisashi froze, looking up at the person who stood in front of him. Toshinori came in over the phone, *“Hisashi? Who is that? They sound familiar…”*

He stepped towards Hisashi, hands stuffed in his jacket pockets, smirk on his lips, and large, crimson wings stretched out behind him.

Hawks smiled, giving a little wave, “...Sup.”

**A/N: Ah, the introduction of Hawks. I'm having a lot of fun with this, and I hope you guys are too. Sorry this came out later in the day than usual. I had a random power outage. Also, the desk joke is something some of you from the old Discord server might actually remember. It spawned from there probably two or three years back. It was just a stupid gag, and also technically an Office reference. I have no issue if it goes nowhere, it's just a dumb joke.**

**More shameless art promotion**
