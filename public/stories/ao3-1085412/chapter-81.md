Harry disappeared within one blink of an eye and another.

Sirius held his breath, hoping…

The maze disappeared in a flash of magic that had the whole audience flinching back.

When the light was blinked out of his eyes Sirius gazed at the empty expanse of the Quidditch pitch below before his gaze darted to the platform, hunting for a sign of Harry.

The tournament was over; three of the Champions stood on the platform, but Harry wasn't among them.

Sirius swallowed hard, ignoring the growing murmur of the crowd at Harry's disappearance.

He knew it would happen. He had known. They had planned for it. He just hadn't considered how much it would *hurt*. The Grim inside of him want to howl and was almost tempted to let it. But there was no time to waste.

His son was in the hands of Voldemort.

He whirled into action.

Minerva stood stern-faced with fierce eyes beside a white-faced Hermione whose hands clutched onto her mother's arm tightly.

"Go!" Sirius growled.

Minerva simply placed her hand on Hermione's shoulder.

Augusta hugged Neville tightly. "Stay safe, Neville."

Neville gave his Gran a solemn nod in response as she moved to stand behind Hermione. She also placed a hand on Hermione's shoulder.

Molly finished hugging her sons goodbye. She brushed a hand over Ron's messy hair, anxiety written across her face.

Arthur moved to her side and carefully eased her away. "It's time, Molly. We agreed we'd do this. I'll watch over them. You need to leave with the others."

Molly nodded jerkily and took a deep breath. "I expect all of you home for breakfast." She took Ginny's hand as though she were a young child, but Ginny didn't protest, simply leaning into her mother to give her comfort. They gathered next to Hermione and they both placed a hand on her shoulder.

Hermione caught Sirius's gaze for a moment and gave him a slow nod; a promise, Sirius realised. She'd fight for Harry.

She touched the necklace she wore and spoke clearly. "Sanctuary."

The women disappeared in a swirl of colour.

"ATTENTION, EVERYONE!" Albus's voice sounded out over the crowd and a hush fell. "HOGWARTS IS DECLARING AN EMERGENCY. ALL STUDENTS AND VISITORS ARE TO BE EVACUATED. PLEASE LEAVE IN AN ORDERLY FASHION TO THE EVACUATION POINTS. AGAIN, ALL STUDENTS AND VISITORS ARE TO BE EVACUATED."

Neville caught Sirius's attention; determination set in the lines of his body in a way that reminded Sirius of Frank. "I've got to assist with the evacuation. Blaise?"

"I'm with you." Blaise said.

"I'll escort you." Percy offered.

Arthur patted Percy's shoulder as he moved to join Neville and Blaise.

The three boys hurried out.

Sirius breathed out sharply knowing Albus would only have given the order so early if the invasion had already begun. Before he could speak, the ethereal shimmer of Albus's phoenix patronus flew into the box.

"Sirius," Albus's voice travelled out of the phoenix's mouth, "the wards have alerted me to a breech in the castle and the centaurs have sent word that there are Dementors and vampires in the forest. We need those who are tasked to raise Hogwarts' defences in place."

"I'll send a reply." Remus offered.

Sirius nodded and turned to the other men with him.

Arthur turned to Sirius. "We'll take the students involved with the Hogwarts spell to the Headmaster's office now. We'll rendezvous with those missing as agreed." He motioned toward the two men standing at the back. "Richard, Leonard? Are you ready?"

Sirius turned to look at them and frowned at the huddle of the Bones' and Abbotts. The families of the other Champions were already gone and Sirius vaguely remembered them heading for the steps at the sight of their children on the platform below.

"Richard?" Sirius questioned sharply.

The Head of the Bones' family turned around, a panicked look on his face, his hand sweeping through his hair. "Sue and Hannah went back to the castle already…"

"Hannah said Sue wasn't able to watch Cedric…" Karen Abbott asserted strongly. Leonard nodded beside her.

Felicity Bones bristled. "And I told you Sue said Hannah wasn't feeling well."

"Well, it won't be the first time Sue has used Hannah to…" Karen began heatedly.

"Ladies!" Sirius interjected sharply. "Now is not the time to argue about this."

"Agreed." Leonard said quickly before his wife could reply.

Felicity gave a disgruntled snort but nodded. "Karen, we should leave."

"I am not leaving without my daughter!" Karen bristled.

"Yes, you are. We have a duty we have committed to doing, sworn on our family magic, to look after the evacuated children." Leonard said briskly. "I'll find Hannah in the castle and send her onto you."

Karen was barely mollified but she conceded with a huff. Her eyes brimmed with anxiety. "You bring our little girl home."

Leonard kissed her softly.

Felicity turned to Richard and hugged him. "Same orders for you too, Rich."

Richard tightened his hold around his wife. "We'll come home to you, Flick."

Felicity shifted out of the embrace and Karen sidled up to her with a defiant gaze. She put her hand on Felicity's shoulder and the two women disappeared in a portkey swirl.

"Draco." Lucius put a hand on his son's shoulder as Draco moved to join the men leaving. "Your survival is paramount. Your mother will be very upset if you are so much as scratched. You understand?"

Draco returned his father's intent gaze and nodded. "Good luck, Father."

Lucius let his son go and Sirius felt some empathy for Lucius's fleeting look of anxiety that travelled across Lucius's expression.

Sirius watched as the motley band of Weasleys, Draco, Theo, Richard and Leonard left. The box which had been so full a moment before was almost empty save for himself, Lucius and Remus.

Remus lifted his communication mirror. "The pack is in position here."

"Now what?" Lucius said, breathing in deeply.

"Now we leave for Little Hangleton and find Harry." Sirius said firmly. Because he wasn't leaving his son in the hands of Voldemort for any longer than necessary. He lifted the plain wool scarf they'd use as a portkey and the others shuffled to grasp it.

*We're on our way, Harry*, Sirius thought fiercely, hoping somehow his son could hear his thoughts and take strength from them.

o-O-o

It was the sounds around Harry that crept back into his consciousness first.

A crunch of a twigs and the sucking sound of someone stepping into mud by his head. A low hiss nearby. The wind hitting something metallic and heavy. The crackle of a fire…

The scent of the smoke drifted across him, dragging him from the unnatural sleep he'd been in.

His nose wrinkled. There was smoke and ash in the air but also a strong smell of dirt and grass and leaves…and over it all the stench of a decaying body.

Harry kept still, fighting the urge to open his eyes and understand where he was and what was happening.

He'd taken the cup and been stunned; he had allowed himself to be abducted by Voldemort. Wherever he was, he wasn't safe.

And he was cold.

Harry figured he was lying on the ground. There was stone against his back; a headstone or tomb most likely. His hands were tied in front of him, resting heavily on his stomach, and there was the heavy weight of rope around his ankles. The sharp bite of the wind wrapped itself around his whole body and he was fuzzily aware that he seemed to have lost his jacket. He still had his knife but he figured he'd lost his wand. Voldemort wasn't an idiot.

As though to prove the truth of that, Tom Marvolo Riddle spoke. "You might as well open your eyes, Harry Potter."

Harry opened his eyes. For a moment he wondered where his glasses were as his surroundings blurred in his vision, but then he felt them still on his face. He pushed his panic down and scrambled to sit up.

"Severus, please inform young Harry where he is." Voldemort said silkily.

"The cemetery at Little Hangleton can be found behind the church." Snape intoned loudly, clearly somewhere to Harry's right.

The world sharply clicked into focus.

He was in a cemetery tied to a headstone.

Voldemort sat on a chair to his right in front of a large cauldron. Harry felt for the child Voldemort had possessed; the stink of rotting flesh was almost overpowering and the sight of the corpse Voldemort wore was horrific. Harry felt a rush of nausea at the pus and bloody lesions that littered the grey skin, and had to swallow hard.

Pettigrew hovered behind his Dark Lord, a shuffling ratty figure. Harry shot him a look of contempt before shifting his gaze to Snape.

He knew he couldn't give away Snape's position and effected a dark scowl. "Snape! I knew you couldn't be trusted."

"Just as pathetic as your father and *Black*." Snape shot back sneeringly, his hands deep in the pockets of his robe

"Now, now." Voldemort said sternly. "Let's not argue with our prime ingredient, Severus."

Snape immediately lowered his head. "As you wish, my Lord."

"Traitor. You're as bad as the rat." Harry hissed, keeping up the pretence, and noticing how Pettigrew scurried back behind his Dark Lord at the mention of him. "My Dad is going to…"

"Do nothing." Voldemort asserted. "I may have sent Barty along to play with him at Hogwarts." He smiled grotesquely. "After all, this matter is between us."

Harry felt his mouth go dry. Sirius wouldn't be at Hogwarts for long, he reassured himself. Sirius planned to get to Little Hangleton as soon as everything was in motion at the school.

"What do you want with me?" Harry snapped. "Didn't getting disembodied the last two times we met tell you anything?"

"It told me you are a worthy enemy." Voldemort replied. "Tonight you will assist in returning me to a body and I will return to my former greatness."

Harry made a show of struggling against his bonds.

"We'll begin as soon as the potion is at temperature," Voldemort continued, his tone almost lecturing as though he was in a classroom, "and then we shall meet on the battlefield, Harry Potter, and I will give you the honour of a wizard's death." He caressed the wand in his hands. "But until then…*Crucio!*"

Harry's eyes widened as the spell shot towards him; he had nowhere to go. The spell hit and his body arched in pain for a long excruciating moment before he fell back against the stone headstone, panting. His body was screaming in pain; every ache, bruise and scratch burned. He took in a rasping breath.

"My Lord," Snape murmured deferentially, "as much as I enjoy seeing Potter finally put in his place, the potion requires his blood to be at a resting state. I fear if you continue to torture him before the ritual some of the effects may be duplicated into your new body."

Harry tried to control his expression; tried to make sure the relief of Snape intervening wasn't too obvious.

"You may be right, Severus." Voldemort tilted his head as he considered it. "I shall wait until after the ritual is completed."

"I believe you've made a wise choice to wait, my Lord." Snape inclined his head and went back to the potion.

Relief washed through Harry so fast he almost felt dizzy with it. Snape had saved him from getting tortured.

"Peter, gag our guest. I don't wish to hear him speak until after the ritual is done." Voldemort ordered.

Harry struggled as Pettigrew hurried over but he was forced to accept the black cloth Pettigrew used to gag him. Harry glared at the rat until he scampered back behind his master.

Harry lowered his eyes and focused on his breathing; every breath hurt. He pushed the pain aside and reached inside to his magic. He focused on a wandless silent healing spell that Flitwick had taught him for duelling. It wouldn't do much to counter the Cruciatus spell but it would help with the damage he'd taken in the tournament and his portkey landing.

He just had to be patient, Harry told himself; he had to be patient and wait for the right moment. Once his blood was used, he could call the Hallows and even the playing field. He knew Sirius would be somewhere close just waiting. He risked a quick glance towards Snape.

Whatever happened, he wasn't alone.

o-O-o

Barty stepped out of the vanishing cabinet and into the Divination room classroom. He allowed himself a small smile and opened his arms to the girl waiting impatiently beside it. He tolerated her gauche hug and separated himself from her after only a moment. He hadn't enjoyed having sex with her the night before when she'd sneaked out to meet with him and he was glad the pretence was almost over. Almost over but not quite done. He cupped her cheek.

"My beautiful girl." Barty kissed her lips softly. It had been so easy to seduce her, so easy to turn her from her parents and her vows. Of course, the occasional compulsion spells on the notes and suggestion potions his elf had ensured she'd received had helped things along. "My beautiful Hannah."

Amos Diggory had been a wonderful tool. Barty had been able to control the drunkard easily once he'd had access to the Ministry in the Summer and before he'd lost his access at Halloween. Diggory had taken a sympathetic-to-his-werewolf-cause Crouch to dinner with the Abbotts just before the World Cup and Barty had realised just how useful Hannah would be inside of Hogwarts, inside the alliance.

It had been easy to convince her to romance Neville Longbottom. Barty had wanted to make the boy his own son, the happy memory of playing with him alongside Rab one of the few he had left. So easy to convince her to make sure that Neville was alone on the night of the Yule ball so dear departed Igor could kidnap him.

She'd grown sick of pretending with Neville though and Barty had encouraged her to use her friend's reaction to the second task as an excuse to gain some distance from him. They'd also used her excuse of spending time with the depressed Bones girl to sneak away and meet in secret. It had been perfect.

Perfect until after Easter when the truth had been discovered and the alliance had put the buddy system in place. Luckily his identify of Pinner had given Barty the excuse of tutoring Hannah to help her catch-up her studies. She had been his secret weapon; the spy who had told him about the alliance's plans allowing him to be a step ahead.

"Barty!" Hannah simpered. "Are you alright?"

"I'm well." Barty smoothed a lock of hair away from her fringe. "And you have done wonderfully, my Hannah."

Hannah kissed him again and he allowed her passionate mauling for as long as he could stand. Luckily a low moan across the room gave him the excuse to break her hold.

"Well, well, well. Look, if it isn't Sybill Trelawney." Barty smiled widely as he walked over to the terrified woman. Hannah had done a pretty decent job of wrapping her in ropes and gagging her. "Do you know the Dark Lord wants you alive?"

Trelawney's shook her head frantically.

"Apparently," Barty continued stooping to kneel on one leg beside her, "there's some prophecy about him that you gave all those years ago. You know the one? The one that proclaimed Harry Potter would be his downfall."

Trelawney tried to avoid his hand, wriggling away, but Barty caught her hair easily and yanked her head back.

"It's because of you the Dark Lord went after the Potters." Barty commented still in the same conversational tone. "Because of you we went to the Longbottoms. You're the reason I lost Rab." He paused. "Well, not the whole reason because that's on Black."

Trelawney made a muffled sound; trying to speak.

"Shush now." Barty crooned. "Don't worry. I'm not going to hand you over to the Dark Lord." He threw her down and stood up.

"You're not?" asked Hannah surprised.

"No." Barty adjusted his gloves and un-holstered his wand. "Once I might have rushed to do his bidding but no longer. I'm working for my own future now."

Hannah smiled at him brightly. "Oh Barty. That's wonderful."

"It is." Barty agreed. "So I don't need some old deluded crazy woman who smells of sherry and piss. Avada Kedavra!" He slashed his wand and in a wash of green light Trelawney's life was ended.

Hannah gave a short cry, hands flying up to cover her mouth.

Barty turned to her and hugged her. "She had to be killed, Hannah," He soothed her. "She would have been in the way."

"You're right." Hannah said. "You're right."

"Where are Moody and Black?" Barty asked.

"Still at the Quidditch pitch." Hannah said. "Sirius was in the Champions' box."

"Then I'll meet him there." Barty kissed her gently. "You know your mission."

Hannah nodded. "I'm to stop the students from raising Hogwarts' defences."

"Go now." He ordered softly. "We will meet when it is over."

Hannah pulled away reluctantly but she nodded and left.

Barty waited until she was gone before he moved back to the cabinet and knocked against the door three times. He opened it and Travers stepped out and moved aside for the vampires and the wizard mercenaries that followed.

The room quickly filled with the first wave of the Dark Lord's army.

Barty stood on the desk to gain their attention. "We're in the heart of Hogwarts. You have the run of the castle. Kill anyone you find." He wasn't too bothered if they found Hannah. Her usefulness was at an end. "Kill them all."

They all clattered out of the tower.

Travers stepped up to Barty. "Where is…"

"Our targets are on the Quidditch pitch." Barty said briskly. "Shall we?"

Travers grunted and made to leave. He stopped abruptly catching sight of Trelawney. "The Dark Lord wanted her alive."

"My spy unfortunately killed her before we arrived." Barty lied easily.

Travers shot him a sceptical look but he continued on.

Barty grinned.

Oh, it was going to be a wonderful night, Barty considered cheerfully.

The whole world was going to burn.

o-O-o

Hermione wrenched her gaze away from the awful carpet in the hall and followed her mother into the newly magically expanded kitchen where the rest of the women had gathered with a worried Dobby. Hermione sat at the table and quietly observed, her head and heart too filled with thoughts of Harry.

The moment he had disappeared…it had been expected but so devastating.

Harry was in the hands of his enemy; an evil Dark wizard who wanted him dead. He had to be scared and hurt.

She wished she could be with him but it was always Harry in the end. It had been their first year with the traps and puzzles; only Harry had faced Voldemort at the last. Second year had been no better since Harry had ended up in the Chamber of Secrets with the shade of Voldemort on his own with only a phoenix to help him. At least in their third year she had been with him as they had saved Sirius.

She was barely aware of the others arriving and gathering around; of Kreacher and Dobby taking care of making tea and getting everyone settled. The elves had been ordered by Harry to keep the women of the House safe.

Ginny slid into the seat next to her and wrapped a hand around the fist Hermione had rested on the table. "He'll come home."

"He damn well better." Hermione murmured.

"Harry won't let Tom win." Ginny promised, her brown eyes warm with promise and determination.

Hermione nodded, uncurling her fingers to grasp her friend's hand. "We'll help him make sure of it."

"Ladies, if I can have your attention." Andy called for attention and the gathered women quickly sat at the table.

One side was filled with the House of Potter and Black with the exception of Ginny who remained beside Hermione; Narcissa, Dora, and Minerva. The other was filled with the rest of the women who would constitute the protective coven along with Ginny; Augusta Longbottom, Griselda Marchbanks, Molly Weasley, and an elderly lady who had been introduced as Vivien Verte, and who Hermione knew had a special link to Harry's ancestral line. Hermione's mother was also present but she would remain in the kitchen during the ritual.

Andy stood at the top of the table. "We need to make our final preparations." She cleared her throat. "But I first want us to go over what we're going to do. Minerva?"

Minerva stood and Andy sat. "Lily Potter was an outstanding witch and she gifted Harry with a defensive ward which is based on her love and sacrifice, anchored in the blood she and her son shared. The gift was the result of a spell Lily cast based on the Old Religion." She placed a book on the table. "In this same book, there is a blessing which we performed at Harry's adoption. It ensured the ward was continued by changing the anchor from Lily's blood to the blood of the House of Black." She paused and straightened. "We know this ward has already saved Harry twice. We also know Tom Riddle will steal Harry's blood for his own tonight."

Hermione bit her lip.

"He hopes that the theft will make him immune to Harry's protection and every arithmancy and magical theory on the subject suggests he is right. The theft will effectively neutralise Harry's shield in this and create a magical tether for Harry's magic. But we stand in the stead of Lily and we will not be so easily defeated. The way he has devised his ritual makes him vulnerable to witches' magic and we intend to take full advantage of that." She deferred to Andy.

Andy rose from her chair again. "The House of Black has a reputation and while there are many things in our past we may rail against, we are united in the love we have for our children; in the belief that family comes first." She tapped the book. "As you all know originally we were planning to restore the protection, a spell suggested it could be done but…further study uncovered that it would require the willing sacrifice of someone with Lily's blood – not Harry – and while many of us could cheerfully strangle Lily's sister, she would never give her life willingly." She held up her hand. "And no, coerced to be willing under a threat would still count as unwilling in magical terms."

"Willing and unwilling are difficult to get around." Minerva agreed. "We've had to be very careful about this ritual just as Harry has to be very careful about his state of mind and the circumstances of during the ritual Riddle will enact this evening."

Hermione nodded in understanding. Harry had told her Voldemort's ritual called for his blood to be taken by force. It had been a difficult line to tread, to accept and allow he would be kidnapped for the ritual but retain an unwillingness for his blood to be used in the resurrection of his enemy.

"Then I confess to being slightly bemused," Vivien interjected, "the preparations we've been doing…the ritual is to summon a spirit to restore a blessing."

"It is. Since it is likely that only the death of Riddle will see the protection return via the tether, we've had to find a different way to help Harry." Andy looked around the table. "You've all read and we've discussed the material on the ritual but unfortunately we haven't quite been able to give some of you all the facts regarding the actual blessing we are targeting."

"Then you'd best get on with it." Griselda remarked brusquely.

Minerva stood up. "During Harry's adoption there was a second blessing bestowed upon him by the spirit of Morgana Le Fey. Bertie declared the event need-to-know and those present undertook a vow to never disclose it. Miriam was obliviated of the memory."

"You were exempted?" Griselda said shrewdly.

"Yes." Minerva nodded. "Sirius believed my vow as the Potter Regent was enough to cover the circumstance."

"Tonight, we're going to call forth the spirit of Morgana Le Fey and ensure her blessing is restored to Harry." Andy said firmly. "He'll be shielded with the blessing of the most powerful witch in our history called by witches' magic."

"And?" Vivien tapped the parchment in front of her. "There's a second part to this."

"Well, if everybody agrees we thought we'd also cast *that* spell. It's going to take back by force what Voldemort has stolen; it's just a very advanced switching spell really." Dora commented brightly.

"Miss Granger had the idea." Narcissa said, her voice heavy with approval.

Hermione blushed as everyone turned to look at her.

"And we've helped her create the spell." Minerva confirmed. "Riddle will be the first test subject."

"Well done, lass." Griselda said.

Andy gave a sharp smile. "We're going to make him regret stealing from the House of Black."

"Good." Griselda stated, clearly pleased.

Molly nodded slowly. "You won't get an argument from me."

Augusta tapped the table decisively. "Well, what are we waiting for? Let's get started."

Hermione touched the necklace she wore. *Hold on, Harry,* she thought fiercely; *hold on, we're with you.*

o-O-o

Neville hurried back along the pathway from the Black Lake to the castle. There was a magical storm gathering overhead; dark clouds rolling in with bright splashes of lightening.

The Durmstrang ship was gone. All their students and visitors had been evacuated except Viktor who had stayed behind to help protect Natalie Warren, his girlfriend and the reserve for the Ravenclaw spot in the Hogwarts spell.

Similarly, the Beauxbatons' carriages had taken to the sky, disappearing from view within seconds. But a few of their students and parents, Fleur and her father included, remained behind determined to help Hogwarts defend itself from the invasion. They'd been sent by Moody to defend and assist in the infirmary.

Neville made a final dash along the path and entered Hogwarts through a side door to the gardens. Blaise was waiting for him.

"We're missing five students. All the other lower years and upper years except for the few seventh years who volunteered to stay and defend the castle are evacuated. The Professors who were in charge of the evacuated students are gone. There's a group of werewolves, aurors and Unspeakables being led by Professors Flitwick and Hilliard who've entered the castle and are starting to search for the invaders. There's another contingent out on the grounds under Moody's direction." Blaise reeled off easily. "The group heading for the Headmaster's office entered fifteen minutes ago through the main doors."

"Who are the five missing students." Neville said not breaking stride as they left the passage-way and went up a set of stairs.

"Lavender Brown, the Patil twins, and the Creevey brothers." Blaise flashed a smile. "All Gryffindors."

"Idiots." Neville huffed. He paused and took out a brand new parchment from his pocket. He tapped it with his wand. "I solemnly swear I am up to no good."

A copy of the Marauder's Map unfolded in front of them and Blaise whistled.

"You have to give Lord Black his due," Blaise said admiringly, "he and his friends were bloody smart."

Neville nodded absently; he was just pleased Remus had found a way to duplicate the original. He focused on finding the missing group. He frowned as he registered the packs of vampires moving out of the Divination tower; at the name Barty Crouch written there along with Dennis Travers. He pushed aside the need to inform someone; Flitwick would already know and Ron would keep a check on the map he had.

"There!" Blaise pointed at Gryffindor tower.

"What the hell are they doing there?" Neville muttered. He sketched a clear route through the school for himself. He had no wish to become a vampire snack and he knew he had to stay safe if he was to keep his promise to Harry. "Right," he said, "I'll go get them. You'd best use your emergency portkey and evacuate."

Blaise shook his head. "Someone has to watch your back. We'll go together."

"Blaise…" Neville sighed heavily, meeting his friend's eyes bravely. "I won't be evacuating. I'm staying." Not that he'd told anyone but Harry that. His Gran firmly believed he would be at the Black Estate safe and sound once the evacuation was complete. But he had promised Harry and he needed to be at Hogwarts in case the worse was to happen.

"Yeah, I figured that." Blaise shrugged. "It doesn't change the fact that you need someone to watch your back."

Neville swallowed hard. "That's not exactly Slytherin of you, Blaise."

"Of course it is." Blaise said firmly. "If you or *someone* can reign in your Gryffindor recklessness and ensure you don't get killed, you're going to be Chief Warlock some day." He grinned widely at Neville. "We Slytherins like to plan ahead."

Neville snorted and mock punched Blaise on his upper arm. He knew Blaise was planning ahead and he also knew that it wasn't the reason he was staying with him. "Come on then. Let's go round up the rest of the reckless Gryffindors."

Blaise fell into step beside him and they continued up the stairs. They rounded the corner and they stopped abruptly as they almost walked into Hannah.

"Neville!" Hannah gave a cry and threw herself at him.

Neville frowned but his arms were already around his former girlfriend, patting her tentatively on the back. "What are you doing here, Hannah?"

"I got separated from Sue somehow and I've lost my portkey and I've been trying to find my Dad…I was going to the Headmaster's office." Hannah babbled out.

Neville gently disengaged her. "We're on our way to Gryffindor tower to round up some students. You can come with us and once we have them evacuated we'll get you to the office and see where Sue's gotten to."

"Thanks, Neville." Hannah beamed at him.

Neville shook his head as she went to grasp his hand. "We should both have our hands free and wands out. There's an invading army in the castle."

"You're right." Hannah blew out a breath. "Sorry."

"Shall we get going?" asked Blaise breezily.

Hannah nodded and set off, leaving the two boys to follow her.

Neville exchanged a look with Blaise; something wasn't right. Blaise signalled that he'd keep an eye on their unexpected company and Neville accepted with a quick nod. He caught up with Hannah quickly and frowned as he tried to work out what was bothering him.

They were almost at the tower when his mind cleared; one thought echoing through his head like a siren…

Why hadn't he seen Hannah on the Marauder's Map?

o-O-o

Albus strode across the Quidditch pitch towards Alastor. His pace was quick without seeming rushed. He was glad to see the paraphernalia of the tournament had been set aside with only the platform remaining as Alastor was using it as a command post.

Albus hurried up the steps as his sense of the wards pinged again. "The wards are reporting multiple incursions in the castle!"

"We're almost fully evacuated. Longbottom looks like he and Zabini are going after the strays. Flitwick's leading a group to deal with the intruders inside the castle." Alastor replied gruffly. "The infirmary is locked down and guarded – only someone with a valid portkey can enter."

"The children who are to perform the Hogwarts spell…"

"Should have been in your office the whole time." Alastor remonstrated. "It was a bloody stupid idea for them to watch the task!"

Albus looked slightly taken aback by his friend's ferocity but he couldn't argue that the more sensible approach would have been to have had the group already in place. "They would have been missing Mistor Diggory."

"They could have done it without him." Alastor grumbled. "Anyway, they're making slow progress but so far so good, and they've got a good set of adults protecting them."

"Is there any word from Sirius?" Albus asked.

"Amelia said he and the others had made it there; everyone's in position." Alastor heaved a heavy sigh. "But they're blind and deaf to the location until Snape manages to give them the secret."

He pointed towards the forest. "We've got vampires and Dementors just inside the forest. They're probably waiting for some kind of signal to attack."

Albus fingered his wand – his first wand. The Elder wand was with the cloak waiting for Harry to call them. Albus missed its hum of power but there was a familiarity about his first wand that warmed and welcomed him in a way he'd never felt when he had carried the Elder wand. Perhaps, Albus mused, it was another sign that nobody but the Peverell line, that *Harry* was meant to carry the wand.

"On the ward line by the forest." Alastor said bluntly. "You need to keep everything in the forest out of the grounds."

Albus nodded. "Understood. Send Hagrid to assist me?"

Alastor agreed. "He's locking the gates but as soon as he's done I'll send him your way." He paused and his magical eye whirled around. "Watch yourself, Albus. Riddle wants this place and you dead as much as he wants Potter's blood."

"Tom Riddle will never take Hogwarts." Albus said confidently. "You stay safe, old friend."

They clasped hands for a brief moment; their years of friendship almost tangible enough to touch as they regarded each other with fond affection.

Albus let go and made for the forest ward line.

He had a school to protect.

o-O-o

"Damn it!" Cedric clung onto the bannister and took a deep breath.

Ron tried hard not to nag at the older boy but the group was only as fast as their slowest member and Cedric was it. They were stuck on a small staircase. There was a landing just behind them with a corridor to the left which led towards Ravenclaw; an alcove to the right with a statue of Armitage Flank, a famous Quidditch player and former Hogwarts student. They still had a long way to go to the Headmaster's office.

It wasn't Cedric's fault, Ron reminded himself. Cedric had been injured in his challenge with the Acromantula. Ron knew just how awful those monsters were first hand.

"Are you alright, Cedric?"

Ron wasn't surprised that it was Luna who stepped forward and put a hand on Cedric's shoulder.

"I'll make it." Cedric said, his eyes shining with a grim determination. "I have to; I'm the only Hufflepuff student here."

"Sue and Hannah must have had a good reason to leave." Ron's Dad said evenly, casting a look toward the two unhappy fathers who were accompanying them.

Ron still couldn't believe it. Well, he could because Sue had gone through a lot but he'd really thought she was committed to helping them with the spell. She had been great during the preparation sessions.

"We should keep moving." Amos Diggory had insisted on escorting his son.

"Maybe we should create a stretcher and have someone levitate Cedric." Ron suggested.

"That actually…" Fred began.

"Is an incredibly good idea." Natalie agreed. She twirled her wand and took off her scarf. A second later it was transfigured into a stretcher. "Come on, Cedric, hop up."

"I don't…"

"Want to delay us further." Draco stated with characteristic tactlessness.

Ron wasn't going to argue with the Slytherin though; he was fairly willing Cedric to get a move on himself.

Cedric grimaced but he gave in and started to limp back down to get to the stretcher. Viktor moved to his side to assist him.

"Great," Ron breathed out a sigh, "let's…"

"KILL THEM ALL!" A voice shouted.

A flash of green light came from above.

"Cedric!" Amos dived on top of his son and a moment later landed lifeless on the floor.

"DAD!" Cedric called out horrified.

"GET OFF THE STAIRCASE!" shouted Ron urgently, pulling Luna down the steps.

The blasting spell came out of nowhere aiming directly at Viktor.

Cedric pushed Viktor roughly aside –

Viktor fell to the landing, taking Ron's Dad and Leonard Abbott with him –

and the spell punched through Cedric and blasted the staircase.

They all went flying.

Someone had the presence of mind to cushion the floor and they bounced.

Cedric landed like a broken doll; blood already pooling around his head and blasted middle.

"SHEILDS!" Ron shouted, not caring that he was ordering his own father and brothers.

"Everybody, take cover!" His Dad ordered, running forward and dragging a shocked Viktor to the side of the staircase.

Another blasting spell came down toward them and Ron grabbed Luna, hustling her behind the nearby statue. He was joined a split second later by Draco and Theo. Fred and George had grabbed Natalie and they'd dived around the other side just before a green spell hit, cracking the stone. Ron winced. He glanced up the stairwell and his heart sank as he took in the dark shapes of vampires crouched in the shadows.

Ron swallowed hard at the sight of the Diggorys lying abandoned at the foot of the ruined staircase. He should do something…grab Cedric and…

Luna placed a hand on his arm. "They're gone." She said sadly.

The vampires leaped to the top of the staircase and Ron tightened his grip on his wand.

A moment later and his Dad, Viktor, Leonard and Richard were all fighting, magic erupted in streams up and down the staircase.

"GO!" His Dad shouted from the other side of the landing. "RUN! We'll hold them off!"

Ron felt frozen with fear. It was his Dad! He couldn't expect to leave his Dad!

"Through here!" Fred opened up a panel behind the statue and gestured for them all to get inside.

Draco and Theo moved immediately.

"Come on, Ron!" Natalie caught his arm and yanked him to the opening. Luna went ahead of them, casting a lumos as soon as she entered the dark narrow space.

They all paused as George closed the panel and sealed it. He added another spell.

Natalie grimaced. "What was that?"

"A bit of a surprise for anyone trying to follow us." George said grimly.

"This way." Fred said. "It leads to a corridor near the office."

"Do I want to know how you know all the secret passages in the castle?" Natalie asked with a sigh.

"It's a damn good thing they do!" Ron said hotly.

Natalie shook her head. "I didn't mean…"

"We know." Fred interjected, sounding so serious that Ron could hardly believe it was Fred who had spoken. "But we all have to stick together, right?"

"Well, do we?" asked Draco suddenly. "I hate to be crass but we're missing a Hufflepuff." His white face shone in the dark. "We can't do the spell."

"Draco's right." Theo said. "Unless anyone knows where we can find a replacement?"

"The infirmary." Natalie replied promptly, causing them all to look at her.

"Robert Ogden is in the infirmary helping to guard it." Natalie explained. "He's aware of the spell and he can do it. He was a bit disappointed not to be on Harry's list."

Ron sighed and rubbed his nose, unaware of the streak of dirt he was leaving behind. "And how exactly are we meant to get him?"

That stumped them all for a long moment.

"Floo." Luna said suddenly.

"What?" asked Ron feeling stupid.

It was Theo who replied. "We can floo the infirmary from the Headmaster's office and Ogden can step through the same way. Moody locked down the external floo but internal should still work."

"Good plan, Luna." Natalie said.

Ron saw how Luna's face brightened with the praise. "Brilliant, Luna." He added.

There was a small moment of shared camaraderie.

"Right then." Fred said. "Let's get moving."

And they set off again. Ron cast a look behind him, worry about his Dad niggling at him again. But he had a duty to perform and he wouldn't let Harry down.

o-O-o

Sirius stared at the mirror.

It had activated a moment before and Sirius had grabbed hold of it. He didn't dare speak to acknowledge the connection had been made in case he gave away Snape's position as a spy. He'd charmed his own mirror immediately to ensure it didn't transmit any of the noise around him.

They were all camped out in the small flat they had acquired as their Little Hangleton headquarters. Lucius waited in the back room while the rest of them stayed in the living room; Amelia, the Rat Squad and the female member of the Treasure team, Caro.

The Treasure team had planned to be in the cemetery, camped out in a hidden corner in the hollow of a tree. They had suspected that Voldemort would place it under Fidelius but both were hopeful that being present prior to the secret would enable them to remain in place. Theoretically, it should have worked. Unfortunately the reality was that the secret obliterated the location from their minds and they had been left confused about where they were and why they were there.

Caro was chagrined. She had been in the tree in her animagus form and had simply flown off only to realise her mistake once she'd resumed human form trying to resolve the confusion she'd felt. Bill though had somehow managed to stay put and Sirius gave thanks the Weasley heir was somewhere already in the cemetery; hopefully within earshot of Harry.

All Sirius could see in the mirror was darkness; the inside of Snape's pocket. He could barely hear anything except for Snape despite casting an amplification charm so the whole room could hear it.

Remus hovered by his arm.

"*My Lord,"* Snape's voice rasped out of the mirror*, "as much as I enjoy seeing Potter finally put in his place, the potion requires his blood to be at a resting state. I fear if you continue to torture him before the ritual some of the effects may be duplicated into your new body."*

Sirius stiffened, a low growl escaping him. The bastard was torturing his son!

"*I believe you've made a wise choice to wait, my Lord."* Snape's voice sounded strongly through the mirror again.

"Thank Merlin! It sounds like Severus managed to convince him to wait until after the ritual before…" Remus's voice trailed away.

"Before continuing to torture Harry?" Sirius snarled caustically.

Remus placed a hand on Sirius's arm and Sirius was vaguely aware of the flash of amber that flitted through Remus's gaze as he silently warned the others to leave Sirius to him. "We always knew this would be the hardest part; that even if we knew the secret of the location, we have to let the ritual take place. It will be easier to get rid of Riddle if he inhabits a corporeal body than if he's still a wraith."

Sirius spun away from his old friend and paced the length of the room to the window. Outside the grey pavements with their myriad of puddles looked dirty and bleak. He breathed in deeply. He should never have allowed this. He should have found a different way. What had he been thinking?

Remus settled beside him again. "A few more hours, Padfoot, and it will be over. Tom Riddle will be gone; Harry will be safe. You and he can live long and happy lives. You just have to hold onto that."

Sirius dragged a hand over his face. "He's been tortured, Moony."

"And we'll heal every hurt when we can get to him." Remus stressed.

"Sirius!" Amelia called out to him urgently.

Sirius hurried back over to the mirror. "What?"

"The ritual…" Amelia cleared her throat and pointed to the dark mirror, "they're about to begin the ritual."

Sirius sat down abruptly. It had to happen; Voldemort had to regain his body and the ritual be completed so they could kill him once and for all. The theory was far too vague about what would happen to the wraith if all the horcruxes were destroyed prior to Riddle regaining a body of his own.

Harry wasn't alone, Sirius reminded himself. Snape for all his flaws and faults was with him. He'd already intervened about the torture…not to mention Bill was somewhere in the cemetery. Harry wasn't alone.

"*The potion is ready, my Lord."* Snape's voice echoed in the living room.

"Maybe you should step out, Padfoot?" Remus murmured with far too much sympathy in his voice.

Sirius shook his head. "No," he said roughly, "if Harry must suffer through this, it's the least I can do to bear witness."

Remus nodded and took the seat next to him. He offered his hand and Sirius took it, holding on tightly as a hush fell and they all stopped to listen to the resurrection of Riddle.

o-O-o

Harry squirmed against the ropes that bound him. There was a little bit of give in the set that tied his hands and wrists. He'd bet money that it had been Snape who'd tied him up. The Potions Professor would have tried to have given him some kind of advantage whereas Pettigrew seemed invested in the opposite – the gag was certainly tight enough.

Snape turned to the Voldemort-infested corpse. "The potion is ready, my Lord."

A huge snake slithered into view and wound itself around the legs of the seat Voldemort was perched upon. *"I will watch them, Master, as you commanded."*

Harry kept his expression blank, not wanting to give away that he had understood even if the likelihood of Wormtail not informing Voldemort that he was a parselmouth was slim.

"*Excellent, Nagini."* Voldemort replied. "Peter, deliver me to the cauldron!"

Harry watched unwillingly as Peter picked up the slimy husk and carried it to the large cauldron. He could hear the liquid inside bubbling away over the crackle of the fire that still burned below it.

Peter carefully lowered the Voldemort-thing into the cauldron. There was a slosh and plop as the liquid sucked the thing below its surface.

Snape pointed his wand at a nearby bag and a small vial whizzed past Harry and into Snape's hand. "Bone of the father, unknowingly given, you will renew your son." He intoned as he sprinkled the powder substance into the cauldron. Bright white sparks lit the night sky.

He kept the vial and nodded at Pettigrew.

Peter stepped forward and pulled a dagger from his robes. He held out his right hand with its missing finger over the cauldron's surface.

Harry could see how scared the rat was; it fairly blared from every line of his body, from the whites of his wide eyes, and tensed face.

"Flesh of the servant," Peter stuttered out, "willingly given; you will revive your master." He lifted the dagger high.

Harry turned away as it arched downwards and flinched at the shriek of agony which sounded through the graveyard. There was another splash as the flesh hit the liquid. Bright purple sparks shot into the air and there was a bubbling, churning, hissing sound coming from the cauldron.

Snape snapped a spell at the prone Pettigrew, huddled on the ground, cradling his mutilated arm to his body. Bandages wrapped themselves around the bleeding stump. Snape summoned the dagger Pettigrew had abandoned and caught it with finesse. He walked steadily over to Harry and knelt beside him.

Harry made a show of trying to get away from him. Snape's hand snapped out and grabbed his left arm – his least dominant one. Snape shoved the material of the shirt up until the wrist was revealed.

Snape's dark eyes glittered as they met Harry's. "Blood of the enemy, forcibly taken, you will resurrect your foe." He slid the knife into Harry's flesh, neatly avoiding all the major arteries and veins; ensuring the damage could be easily healed.

Harry cried out, the sound muffled by the gag, because – damn it! – it hurt! The dagger was drawn out of him, and placed on the ground while Snape spelled the blood that trickled down into the vial.

Snape waited until the vial was almost full before he stood up in a sharp movement. His wand twitched out and Harry felt the wound seal itself; knitting together tightly. It was painful but Harry was grateful for the simple healing. He couldn't afford any lingering weakness if he was to survive the confrontation to come.

The blood was added to the cauldron and almost immediately there was a bright red flash; static electricity shot out and around the cauldron. It was mesmerising until the reason for the display was considered.

Snape kept his back to Harry, eyes on the cauldron…

The snake hissed loudly in celebration, rising up to see…

Wormtail was a sobbing mess on the floor…

And Harry knew it was time to disappear.

Steam erupted from the cauldron in a thick white cloud…

Harry reached inside of himself to the Hallows and called…

A figure emerged from the cauldron as the cloud evaporated…a tall and muscled naked adult male with dark wild hair slicked with grey at the temples; sharp aristocratic features whose handsomeness was twisted by the cruel glint from red eyes. "Robe me!"

Harry closed his eyes and called again for his cloak, for the stone, for the wand…

*Hallows to me*, Harry whispered desperately; *Hallows to me*, *the last of the Peverells*…

As Snape hurried a distracted Voldemort into a black cloak, Harry felt the air stir; a wand slapped into his hand; the stone landed as a heavy weight in his pocket and the cloak wrapped itself around him, covering him completely…

"Thank you, Severus," Voldemort said politely, "you have done well." He stroked a hand down his robes. "My new body is excellent. *Is it not, Nagini*?"

"*It is better.*" Nagini replied.

Harry cast a localised severing charm on the ropes with the Elder wand.

Voldemort raised a hand and his wand sailed from the chair he'd occupied into his hand. He obliterated the chair with a silent blasting spell and Harry used the moment to pull free from his ropes and dart around the back of the headstone.

"Finally." Voldemort turned towards where Harry had been tied and froze.

Snape made a show of following Voldemort's gaze and giving a startled gasp. "Potter! But I had him tied up!"

Voldemort gave a low hiss and gestured at the dagger. "He must have used that to free himself. *Find him, Nagini! Bring him to me!*"

Harry kept huddled in his invisibility cloak. The snake slid right past him and gave no sign that it had even suspected at his location.

"No matter." Voldemort said slowly. "A Dementor friend guards the perimeter. He won't get far."

It explained the chill in the air, Harry mused.

Voldemort smiled nastily. "We'll deal with Potter soon but first…" he gestured at Snape, "your arm, Severus!"

Snape held out his arm and Voldemort poked his wand into the centre of the Dark Mark.

"Think of the secret as I call them, Severus, so they will know where they are when they arrive." He laughed, a short inhuman sound. "Let's see who of them dares not answer my call after all this time!"

Harry repressed the sigh that wanted to escape. He'd hoped Voldemort would have to speak it out loud again and hopefully communicate it to Sirius. Still...Voldemort was voluntarily accepting additional players into the cemetery and they'd planned for that…all he had to do was wait.

o-O-o

Barty gave a laugh as he managed to clip Arthur Weasley with a cutting curse. The slash across the man's forehead started bleeding immediately.

The mercenary beside him sent another blasting hex down the stairs.

A vampire jumped down to the landing only to be dispatched with a beheading by the Durmstrang Champion. It was a decent beheading.

"THERE!"

The shout came from above them and suddenly spell-fire was raining down on them.

Barty swore and raised a shield, scuttling back behind cover. He caught a glimpse of Flitwick at the head of a large group of people and cursed again. The half-goblin was just as bloodthirsty as the rest of his species.

"SOLUS VAMPIRUS!"

Two of the vampires immediately disintegrated into dust; the others dived for the shadows.

Three men jumped down to the landing Barty was using. He recognised them immediately; werewolves.

It was time for him to retreat but first…

Barty threw a vial of potion into the air and fired off a flash spell to hide his own exit. The potion was the Carrows' invention and would turn the werewolves into their animal form. They would be mindless rampaging beasts. Maybe they'd kill the vampires and the mercenaries along with the Weasley idiot and his friends but Barty wasn't too bothered by that.

He was disillusioned but he cast another scent-neutraliser and silencing spell as he ran down the corridor. He made it into a classroom and barricaded the doors. He headed for the window and was pleased to see it had a small trellis just outside of it which went all the way down to the rose garden. He set a fire in the corner of the classroom and started to climb down.

He'd been distracted into fighting the group on his way out which had been a mistake, Barty mused as he carefully avoided the growing roses and found his next handhold.

He had to remain focused.

He needed to find Black and take his revenge.

Nothing else mattered.

He looked out across the grounds and frowned. They seemed strangely deserted. Where were the tournament-goers? The rest of the Hogwarts' staff? He glanced across to the Lake and glowered at the empty expanse of water; Durmstrang was gone and he would bet the rest of his galleons that Beauxbatons was gone too.

They knew.

Somehow they'd known that there would be an invasion.

Probably Moody's bloody paranoia, thought Barty with disgust as he lowered himself to the ground and brushed off the dirt that clung to his robes.

Or maybe they had a spy.

His upper lip curled.

Snape.

Well.

Barty didn't care. It didn't matter to him if the Light rallied and fought the Dark Lord, even if they won. All he cared about killing Black and destroying everything in his wake.

He casually set the rose garden alight as he walked through it.

He knew the maze had been situated at the Quidditch pitch with the stands there reused for the tournament audience. He headed across the grounds in that direction.

He had just rounded the Quidditch changing rooms when he froze at the right of two aurors stood just in front of him. One was smoking and the other was looking at his compatriot with disgust.

"Bloody hell, Jimmy, we're meant to be on duty." The younger one remarked.

"'m 'aving a last fag." Jimmy retorted. "They said we'd be battling vamps and Dementors, not standing on the side-lines guarding a poxy pathway, Padraig."

"You're just sore because Bones took the Rat Squad with her to find Potter." Padraig replied, the reprimanding tone strident in his voice.

"Of course, 'm bloody sore!" Jimmy muttered. "That's where the action'll be! Mebbe if I was there, I'd save the lad and be a hero! Lucy would have to drop her knickers for me then!"

"You're an idiot." Padraig stated. "You have as much chance at getting in her knickers as a Hippogriff."

Barty was amused. He shot out the Killing curse at the idiot, and before Padraig could do more than drop his mouth open in shock at the sight of his friend falling lifelessly to the ground, Barty had killed him too.

He lightly jogged across the ground to the Quidditch stands but slowed as he neared; voices carrying over the wind.

"Moody says Jimmy and Padraig just blinked out. We're to investigate." A crisp upper class accent said loudly.

"Jimmy's probably gone and done something stupid." Another voice complained. "He can barely find his own arse."

"That might be true, Lucinda, but we have our orders."

*Lucinda.* Barty turned the name over in his head. He wondered if Lucinda was the very sensible non-knicker dropping Lucy. He watched as the women came into view, turning the corner from the entry to the Ravenclaw stands.

One was a very pretty blonde; the other a statuesque brunette.

"Right then, Dorothy, you lead the way." The blonde, *Lucinda*, said.

Dorothy sighed and pointed in Barty's direction. "They're supposed to be over there."

Barty raised his wand in anticipation. It was like a duck shoot, he thought happily.

"Jimmy was pissed at not going with Bones." Lucinda shook her head. "I can't see either her or Lord Black putting up with his kind of antics, not when Potter's life is on the line."

"Neither can I." Dorothy sighed. "Did you see Black before he left? He looked so yummy in that dragon-hide."

"Yummy's the word." Lucinda was close enough for Barty to see her grin but he ignored her, his entire body frozen as his mind caught up with their comments.

Black wasn't at Hogwarts.

Black had gone in search of Potter.

Black wasn't there and Barty had no idea where the Dark Lord was because the location had gone under a Fidelius.

Bloody, buggering, bum-fuck!

Barty snarled out his anger and sent a blasting charm towards the stands. He was oblivious to the shouts and yells as a group of aurors ran to investigate. He stormed away, heading to the gates.

He'd have to start at the Dark Lord's manor and head into the town…try to find Black there…

Pain shot through his left arm sending him to his knees and he struggled with the urge to scream.

Barty clutched onto his left forearm, slapping a hand over his Dark Mark.

It was done.

The Dark Lord was resurrected and was calling his Death Eaters.

Bloody Dark Lord.

If Barty had been mid-battle with Dumbledore he'd have been captured! Couldn't the bastard distinguish between them all and leave him alone? He gulped in another breath and pushed a hand through his hair, trying to think past the pain.

"*The cemetery at Little Hangleton can be found behind the church."*

The secret whispered itself into his brain as Barty panted for breath, his arm burning. He gritted his teeth and surged up to stand. He cast a numbing charm over his arm; it dulled the call to an ache.

He could answer the call. Of course, if he simply answered the call, he'd be dead moments after appearing since the Dark Lord had put him in charge of the forces at Hogwarts.

But…

He was disillusioned; he could hide in the graveyard and wait for Black to show up. Merlin knew the bastard probably had some way of tracking Potter; some plan to rescue him.

Well, Barty had a plan now too, Barty thought with furious glee.

And his plan was the only plan that mattered.

He set off again for the gate.

As soon as he was clear of the Hogwarts ward line he'd apparate to Little Hangleton; oh, he'd have to delay his plan to destroy Hogwarts completely but what was an hour or two between explosions after all?

o-O-o

The white shimmer of the wolf patronus came to a halt in front of Minerva. "*Riddle has his body. Harry's hiding. Do the ritual now.*" The patronus faded.

Hermione felt her heart leap into her throat. Harry had been hurt; his blood taken. It was necessary for the resurrection but…

She touched her necklace again. He was hidden by the Hallows. He was safe. For the time-being.

"Places, everyone!" Minerva said loudly.

They all made their way to the living room. It had been part of their preparations during the previous week.

It had been cleared of furniture and decorations; the hideous carpet had been removed to reveal plain wooden floorboards. The walls had been whitewashed and the room thoroughly cleaned with sage.

There were two circles laid out on the floor with plain thick white candles.

The inner circle was only for Dora, Andy, and Narcissa; the blood daughters of the House of Black. There had been quite a discussion about whether Hermione should be within the circle as she was a sworn daughter but ultimately the arithmancy had determined three in the centre and seven in the outer circle.

Minerva ushered the rest of them into position in between the two circles.

Hermione held her breath as she took her place. Vivien Verte took North as the eldest; Ginny took the position to her left as the youngest. Griselda stood beside Vivien on her right and Augusta next to her. There was a space left for Minerva. Molly was next, with Hermione helrself rounding out the circle to Ginny.

They each wore delicate white robes edged with silver and gold thread, the crests of Black and Potter stamped upon their cuffs. It was their only clothing. They were all barefoot. They had each undergone a cleansing before they had changed and Hermione felt almost naked. She touched the necklace she wore. She'd been allowed to keep it for the ritual; its connection with Harry allowing it to be present.

"One last check," Andy called out, "we could be here for some time. We don't know how long it will take to summon Morgana Le Fey. Does anybody need another comfort break?" Her eyes glanced over the two pregnant women next to her.

Dora rolled her eyes.

Narcissa sniffed imperiously.

"Right, Ladies, candles."

They all stooped and picked up the candle behind them.

Minerva switched off the lights. She took her own place in the circle and accepted the candle Augusta offered her. She nodded briskly. "If you please."

Andy smiled. "Lumos."

The candles lit up; their steady yellow flames brightened the room.

"Blessings be to magic." Andy began. "We women of the House of Black gather, protected by our sworn sisters, to call upon Morgana of the line of Le Fey and beseech her help to guard our child, Harry, son of the House of Black. I am Andromeda, mother of the House of Black and I stand in the place of Lily of the House of Potter. Morgana, hear my call by blood, by magic, by spirit."

"Hear her call." Hermione joined in the chime with the rest of the outer circle.

"Blessings be to magic." Narcissa picked up the chant. "I am Narcissa of the House of Black, mother of the House of Black and I stand in the place of Lily of the House of Potter. Morgana, hear my call by blood, by magic, by spirit."

"Hear her call."

Dora took a breath. "Blessings be to magic. I am Nymphadora of the House of Black, mother of the House of Black and I stand in the place of Lily of the family Potter."

"Hear her call."

"Blessings be to magic." Andy began again, and the chant continued.

Time slipped away.

Two, three times they spoke the chant.

And Andy begun again.

Hermione kept focused and willed Morgana to appear.

Four, five times.

"Hear her call."

Six.

Hermione pushed away any despondency; Harry was depending on them.

"Blessings be to magic…"

Hermione felt the candles flicker at Andy's seventh intonation; magic swirled around the room; its touch against her skin electrifying.

"…I stand in the place of Lily of the House of Potter. Morgana, hear my call by blood, by magic, by spirit."

The candles flamed higher.

"…I stand in the place of Lily of the House of Potter. Morgana, hear my call by blood, by magic, by spirit."

And higher.

"…I stand in the place of Lily of the House of Potter. Morgana, hear my call by blood, by magic, by spirit."

Hermione wished with all her heart; she had to save Harry. "HEAR HER CALL."

And the candles went out, plunging them into darkness.

Silence.

The candles flared to life; brighter than before.

Hermione blinked.

And in the centre of their circles stood the silver spirit of Morgana Le Fey.

o-O-o

Harry pressed himself against the gravestone and watched as Voldemort laughed harshly as he called for his Death Eaters.

He tightened his grip on the Elder wand, thankful for the cover of the cloak, even the weight of the stone was a comfort.

His family's legacy.

Defeater of Dark Lords.

Death's Champion.

The Raven that stalked the battlefield.

Harry took a breath; calm and centred.

It was time to send the last pieces of Voldemort's soul to Death.
