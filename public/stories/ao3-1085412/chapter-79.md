*20* *th* */21* *st* *June 1995*

*It was Hogwarts, the Great Hall to be exact with the tables gone and only the four banners of the Houses hanging from the enchanted ceiling which showed a night sky, moon high and round, stars twinkling.*

*Given the dream the night before Harry was unsure if his being at Hogwarts was a good thing or a bad thing. He really didn't want to end up having someone else blubber all over him.*

*He glanced down at his school uniform. He hadn't worn Hogwarts' robes since Halloween but his Gryffindor tie and crest were prominent. He fingered them nervously.*

"*They should have been green and silver." A dark silky tone came out of the darkness.*

*Harry turned sharply to stare in its direction and a wizard moved to stand below the banner of Slytherin. He was dressed in an old-fashioned simple clothing; leathers and roughly woven tunic in a sage green colour. He looked nothing like the statue in the Chamber. He was Roman in profile; dark hair pulled back and tied into a ponytail with a strip of leather. There was a sword holstered on his belt, along with a knife and a wand.*

"*Salazar Slytherin." Harry said, his mouth suddenly dry as the Sahara.*

"*He wears the colours of where he is supposed to be." A booming voice had Harry swinging to his left.*

*A tall red-haired burly man stood under the Gryffindor banner. He wore similar clothing to Slytherin but his tunic was a bright red that clashed badly with his hair. He wore the Gryffindor sword.*

"*He should have worn my colours and would have, had he demonstrated at the Sorting a modicum of the intelligence he was gifted with." A haughty feminine tone sounded from his right and Harry's head snapped back around. Rowena Ravenclaw was a tall regal figure dressed in the finest blue silk robes, high necked with a stiff bodice flaring into wide skirts. She stood under the Ravenclaw banner; a familiar tiara adorned her brow, holding her caramel hair in place, but Harry knew the original had been burned to sludge by Bertie.*

"*He could have worn any of our colours." Harry wasn't surprised to find Helga Hufflepuff, a small diminutive blonde under remaining Hufflepuff banter. She wore a simple witch's day robe in a bright sunny yellow. "Should we not focus on the reason why we are here?"*

"*Wow." Harry muttered. He was standing in the Great Hall talking with the Founders! It was incredible; unbelievable. Hermione was going to be so jealous.*

"*Time is of the essence." Slytherin agreed silkily.*

*Ravenclaw sniffed. "Agreed."*

"*Lad, Hogwarts holds many secrets." Gryffindor said. "She's a castle and not without her defences."*

"*Never tickle a sleeping dragon." Hufflepuff said clearly.*

"*The school's motto." Harry frowned.*

"*Much more than that." Slytherin demurred, fingering his wand.*

"*Defences we placed into the school to come to her aid if they were ever needed." Gryffindor explained.*

"*But not without assistance." Ravenclaw said. "The school must act in concert."*

"*The night of Halloween, four Houses stood with one student." Hufflepuff smiled warmly at Harry, her green eyes shining at him. "They rose in support of one of their own. It renewed Hogwarts' spirit and magic like no other event since we raised the walls."*

"*Four in unison, teachers all, enchanted Hogwarts to sleep…" Slytherin chimed in.*

"*Four in unison, students still, will tickle Hogwarts awake." Gryffindor added.*

"*Four in unison, teachers all, made a sacrifice to magic." Ravenclaw instructed.*

"*Four in unison, students still, will each be their Heirs." Hufflepuff completed.*

"*Choose those who would be cunning." Slytherin said, fading from view.*

"*Choose those who would be brave." Gryffindor's grin was the last of him to fade.*

"*Choose those with learned wisdom." Ravenclaw curtseyed deep and left.*

"*Choose those who would stand beside you. Choose from your heart." Hufflepuff smiled brightly. "For always remember, where there is love there is life."*

*And they were gone.*

"Incredible." The Headmaster murmured, stirring his breakfast tea absently. "I had no idea such defences were part of Hogwarts."

A chorus of agreement sounded from the portraits around him. The Heads of Houses who were also present, frowned.

Harry leaned closer to Sirius. The Headmaster had quickly agreed to the early morning meeting realising it was related to Harry's ongoing dreams. He and Sirius had the seats directly in front of the Headmaster's desk, Minerva sat to Harry's left with the Ravenclaw Head on her other side. Professor Sprout had ended up on the other side of Sirius while Snape had eschewed a seat and lurked at the back of the office.

"Presumably the knowledge of the spell was not passed on at some point in Hogwarts' history leading to it fading from memory." Sprout thought out loud.

Harry pointed at the parchment on Dumbledore's desk. He'd written down everything about the spell as soon as he had woken up. "We should probably try and check if it's right."

It wasn't too complicated but it did involve four students standing in the Headmaster's office and invoking the defences together.

Professor Flitwick nodded. "Some research in the school archives would be a good idea."

Dumbledore inclined his head. "We'll leave that with you, Filius."

Snape cleared his throat. "Are you certain the Professors cannot invoke the spell?"

"No, the Founders were clear it had to be students." Harry confirmed firmly, repressing the urge to squirm in his seat.

Flitwick stared at him agog again at the reminder that Harry had spent his dream with the Founders. "Fascinating."

"And idiotic!" Minerva proclaimed sharply. "If there is danger why would they place students at risk in such a way?"

Harry had to agree with her. The plan of evacuation was a good one as far as he was concerned. The idea that some students would have to remain to invoke the defences was bizarre.

"It was a different time." Filius pointed out sagely. "The students would have been considered as adults at a much younger age than now. We baulk at placing young people into war but they had different cultural mores about such things."

Minerva sniffed in disgust but she didn't repudiate Flitwick's argument.

"Are we seriously going to consider asking students to put themselves at risk?" Sprout frowned at the Headmaster.

Dumbledore glanced across at Harry. "What is your feeling on this, Harry?"

Sirius placed a hand on Harry's shoulder in silent support.

Harry took a deep breath. "I'm getting these dream visitations for a reason. The Founders gave me this spell because they think we need it. I think we'd be foolish to disregard it."

"Unfortunately I don't have a counter-argument against that." Flitwick admitted. "As much as I would like to argue to keep our students safe and out of it."

Sprout gave an unhappy hnmpf and glowered at the parchment on the desk.

"That's the crux of it, isn't it?" Minerva's Scottish brogue was heavy, giving away her own unease with involving students.

"So if we accept the children must be involved it brings us to who we choose." Dumbledore said brightly.

Harry started frowning but as he went to protest Sirius spoke up.

"You mean who *Harry* will choose." Sirius motioned at the parchment. "The Founders gave Harry the task of choosing in his dream."

Dumbledore looked abashed. "Ah, of course. I had forgotten that."

"With respect to Mister Potter," Sprout said hurriedly, "is that sensible? Surely we as the Heads know who would best embody the spirit of our Houses best?"

"But can you guarantee that they won't waver against the Dark Lord?" Sirius countered. "Can you guarantee that they'll stand completely in concert with the others and work to ensure Harry's victory?"

"I would rather choose rather than leave it with Potter," Snape admitted caustically, "but clearly the Founders had a different view."

"I feel the same." Flitwick commented solemnly. "As much as I feel I know my students, I cannot deny that choosing which should take part was not given to me as a task."

Sprout gave a heavy sigh and subsided back into her chair with a shake of her head.

"So, then we're agreed." Dumbledore proclaimed brightly. "The choice falls to Harry."

The proclamation weighed heavily on Harry as he considered the thorny problem of *who* through the rest of the day. In some ways he would have infinitely preferred for the Heads of Houses to have chosen themselves rather than the choice falling to him.

His mind was still whirling as he ate his dinner quietly and contemplated the problem again.

"So who are you going to ask?" Sirius asked without preamble as Harry pushed his empty plate aside.

Harry grimaced. It was a good question. He picked up his hot chocolate. "I don't know."

"Candidates then?" cajoled Sirius lightly.

"Well," Harry bit his lip, "I was thinking that it would be good to have two wizards and two witches."

"Keep it balanced like the Founders." Sirius nodded again.

"And in the same formation?" Harry mused. "If the Founders sent the defences to sleep, perhaps it needs the same to wake them."

"If I didn't know any better I'd say you'd taken up Arithmancy." Sirius teased.

"Remus suggested it." Harry admitted. "I talked with him at lunchtime on the mirror."

"So that would mean you need a female from Hufflepuff and Ravenclaw, male from Gryffindor and Slytherin." Sirius mused out loud.

Harry sighed. "And that's where the problem starts because who do I choose without upsetting someone else? Do I choose someone who's sworn fealty or who is allied to me or do I just choose who I think really is Slytherin or Hufflepuff?"

"Yes," Sirius nodded, "that's a tricky one."

"And I don't really want to place anyone who's very young in any kind of danger." Harry said plaintively.

"It is the reason why we all agreed the students were to be evacuated." Sirius agreed.

Harry blew on his hot chocolate disconsolately. "Now, I have to choose four who'll stay and activate the defences."

"Take it House by House." Sirius suggested. "Who most embodies the qualities of Slytherin House?"

"Honestly, it'd be between Theo and Daphne." Harry said after only a moment's consideration. "But Draco's another possibility. Nobody considers themselves more Slytherin or has more pride about it than Draco."

"So, if you stay with Slytherin having to be male, it's between Theo and Draco." Sirius nodded slowly. "Either would be a good choice. Draco's grown-up a lot since the Summer."

Harry nodded. "And I think Draco would expect if it was a choice between him and Theo, it would be him because of the family connection."

Sirius nodded slowly.

"Gryffindor is difficult." Harry commented. "I mean, there's Ron – well, all the Weasleys, and then Neville."

"You want Ron." Sirius pointed at him. "You just don't want to upset Neville."

Harry heaved a sigh and nodded. "Neville…the alliance are used to him being my second and he has the evacuation plans down. And Ron is…he's bound by his oath of friendship but he's never needed an oath to fight beside me so…"

"So, that leaves Hufflepuff and Ravenclaw." Sirius pointed out.

"I guess Natalie potentially for Ravenclaw." Harry said hesitantly. "She's also the Head Girl so…"

"She stands for all of Hogwarts." Sirius nodded slowly.

"It's Hufflepuff I have the most difficulty with." Harry sighed. "I'm not sure about asking Sue after everything she's been through enough with the second task, but I don't think I can ask Hannah after the way she treated Neville." Hannah might have been loyal to her friend but she'd been unfair to Neville.

"Why don't you discuss it with Sue?" Sirius said. "See what she says. If she doesn't want to do it, you can reconsider but if she says yes…she's your first choice and I think given what you've said about how the Founders laid this all out, that's important."

"Maybe."

Sirius's grey eyes narrowed in speculation and Harry resisted the urge to squirm under his regard. "If you weren't keeping it to those under oath or trying to maintain the same balance in male to female in the same Houses as the Founders, who would actually be your first choice?"

"For Hufflepuff?" Harry sighed, realising that Sirius had gotten to the heart of his discontent. "Cedric." He motioned abruptly as Sirius opened his mouth to speak. "I know there was the whole thing with his father, but he was trying to be loyal to his family and he did come round in the end; he's been great ever since he apologised. He was right there on the night of Halloween and he's been a great Hogwarts Champion. He took that crazy charm in the second task without complaint."

"And Ravenclaw?" asked Sirius mildly.

"Natalie's great but…" Harry sighed. "I know there's no oath but Luna's been a good friend. She's smart and powerful and…she sees out of the box and I think they'll need that."

"Which leaves Slytherin and Gryffindor." Sirius prompted.

"I'd always choose Ron for Gryffindor." Harry said immediately. "He is Gryffindor for me. Same with Draco for Slytherin."

"So, you'd end up with three boys and a girl." Sirius concluded. He sipped his coffee. He tilted his head. "It's a good balance in some ways. Luna and Ron bring chaos and action; Cedric and Draco bring stability and consideration."

"So…" Harry began uncertainly.

"I think you should choose who you want." Sirius advised.

"Luna's a year below us." Harry murmured worriedly.

Sirius nodded gravely.

"And there's a chance that Cedric would be injured in the maze." Harry continued. He tapped his fingers restlessly against his mug. "You know I really think we need reserves."

"That isn't a bad suggestion." Sirius agreed. "So your reserves would be?"

"Fred and George for Gryffindor." Harry said. "I still need Neville on evacuation." And because he had something else in mind for his godbrother.

"Theo presumably for Slytherin." Sirius murmured.

Harry nodded. "I think Sue for Hufflepuff. I think she'll be fine being the reserve for Cedric." He sighed. "And Natalie for Ravenclaw. She's a good choice just not, well, Luna."

Sirius nodded. "Sounds like a good group."

"The primary choices need protecting while they wake the defences so maybe the reserves can do that too." Harry rubbed his head. "I'm going to need to speak to the Headmaster." And the people he'd chosen.

Sirius set his cup down. "For what it's worth, I think you're doing the right thing."

Harry let Sirius's praise warm him.

He hoped he was doing the right thing.

He didn't know if he'd chosen the right people, but he knew he'd chosen from his heart.

o-O-o

Barty prostrated himself in front of the small form of his Lord, of his new Father. He ached with tiredness. He had hardly slept on the vampire barge which had brought him back to England. His stomach had churned with the motion of the rough sea; the quarters had been cramped and the cot threadbare.

Travers had snored the entire time. His travelling companion had seemingly been immune to the disgusting conditions of their journey, but then he'd been the same during the entire trip round Europe. Dennis Travers wore his devotion to the Dark Lord like a cloak of protection that made him invulnerable to trivial mundane matters such as what they ate and where they slept. Travers acted like his time abroad drumming up support was some kind of fantastic religious experience.

Barty knew better.

He wasn't stupid.

He knew he was being punished.

He'd killed Winky. He'd destroyed Severus's damn potion only to find out from the Dark Lord that the Potions Master had a regular habit of saving potion samples at different stages of development. He'd wrecked havoc at Hogwarts only for his efforts to be disregarded.

His new Father had been just as unimpressed with his achievements as the old.

Just as disappointed.

Nothing Barty ever did was right.

Nothing Barty did was ever enough.

It was Severus Snape who was the Golden Child.

Severus who, Barty would bet his life upon it, had no loyalty to *anyone* let alone the man Barty had adopted as his new Father.

Not that he let any of it show on his face or play in his head as he was greeted and welcomed home. He knew better. His face was smoothed into a charming mask of adoration. He had fooled his own flesh and blood for years with the picture of the loving son; he could do it again to the wraith of Rab's Dark Lord.

Rab.

His dead love was the only thing that kept Barty moving forward; kept him on plan. Because Barty had one thing left to do in his life.

Vengeance.

Sirius Black had killed his lover.

Barty owed Black for that.

Black.

The memory of the Black Lord on the top of the Astronomy tower played over in Barty's head. Black had looked good; the Blacks always had. Barty couldn't help the frisson of attraction that had flickered through him at the sight of Black. But it had been the way that Black had been ferociously protective of Potter which had snagged Barty's attention.

Barty sneered internally at the image in his head. Black hadn't made any move to duel him as Barty had been sure he would have; no, Black had been too focused on protecting his precious son. He'd been right to because if Black had wavered for a moment, Barty had planned just the perfect spell to maim the lion a little.

Maim, because the Dark Lord had plans for Potter and Barty might want some recognition for his initiative but he wasn't an idiot; he wouldn't have his life if he'd spoiled the Dark Lord's plans for the boy; the third task would make Potter fight for his life and he'd end it in the hands of the Dark Lord.

Black would die knowing he'd failed to save his treasured child.

The son he loved.

Envy stampeded through Barty. Potter was loved. One father had died to save him; the other had changed the world for him.

Nobody had ever loved Barty like that.

Nobody except Rab.

Barty nodded as the Dark Lord talked and talked about the eve of the solstice; of blood; of power and proof that he was the best.

None of it mattered.

Barty would be back at Hogwarts when the Dark Lord rose again. The Dark Lord had already charged him with leading the invading force into Hogwarts; to cause chaos and destruction while the Dark Lord rose. He'd announced it as though Barty should be *grateful.*

But that was fine.

Barty had left behind a spy in the enemy's camp; someone they would not suspect. A spy even the Dark Lord was clueless about. A secret Barty had kept; his ace in the hole. His spy would ensure the path would be clear when they invaded. And while Potter was being tortured, Barty would be killing Black slowly and painfully. He'd get his vengeance and then he'd join Rab.

There was no Father to love him.

No lover to succour him.

He had nothing left.

But not for long.

*I'm coming, Rab*, Barty thought viciously, as he kissed the hem of the Dark Lord's robe and simpered in simulated awe of the plans and machinations to create a world Barty didn't care about. He'd be with Rab again; he'd be loved again.

Who needed a Father anyway?

*21* *st* */22* *nd* *June 1995*

*It was easy to recognise the hallway of Grimmauld Place. Harry sighed and rubbed the back of his neck. He'd wondered if he'd end up here once he'd sat and reviewed the list of the dead who might show up.*

*He walked down the corridor and up the stairs. The décor was very different; older, austere, and Gothic. Silver snakes acted as door handles and motifs; green Slytherin colours accented everything. Harry shuddered. He could appreciated why Sirius wouldn't have been comfortable in the house and was suddenly glad Sirius had taken the time to completely change the look and feel of the place.*

*His feet took him along a corridor to a familiar door; his own. Only it wasn't. The door was open and revealed a much different bedroom. The colours of Slytherin House dominated; the furniture was dark and heavy.*

*A young man sat on the bed; long dark wavy hair fell about his shoulders. His silver eyes looked up from his book and pinned Harry with a calculating gaze. He slapped the book shut. "Good you're here at last."*

"*Cousin Regulus." Harry gave a small bow.*

*Regulus returned the bow with a nod of his head. "I'm glad you know who I am."*

"*Sirius talks about you a lot." Harry said truthfully. Sirius had initially been reticent about his brother, but more and more, Sirius would tell him stories from his childhood, and more often than not they always included Sirius's younger brother.*

*Regulus pointed at a nearby chair. "Take a seat. This could take some time."*

*Harry pulled up the chair to the side of the bed. "I'm guessing you're not here to pass on a message to your brother?" Regulus seemed far too focused on Harry for that.*

"*Kreacher already passed on my last words for Sirius." Regulus confirmed.*

"*Thank you for that, by the way." Harry said. "Without your note we might have been floundering around for a long time wondering why Voldemort was still alive."*

*Regulus shrugged elegantly. "I only wish I had decided to act sooner against Riddle."*

"*Sirius is very proud of you." Harry informed him warmly, and wasn't surprised at how the young man in front of him seemed to puff up in response. Sirius's approval was clearly something Regulus had yearned for and Harry could relate; he always wanted Sirius to be proud of him.*

"*You and I," Regulus began, "we are Sirius's sons, both of us."*

*He made a gesture for Harry to wait and Harry subsided, questions brimming on the tip of his tongue.*

"*Sirius raised me." Regulus stated simply. "We had a nanny, of course, when we were very young, but my first memory is Sirius taking my hand and helping me back to my feet when I was learning to walk." He smiled sadly. "We were inseparable. He taught me to read; to write; to tell the time. He took my mother's anger when I was at fault; stepped between my father and I when he would try to discipline me for being too soft, too weak." He sighed and met Harry's eyes. "Nobody did that for Sirius when we were children."*

*Harry frowned. He'd known from some of Sirius's stories that Sirius's own childhood held a lot of similarity to his own at the Dursleys; lacking in love with enough neglect to leave lasting scars.*

"*Grandfather tried, I think. He made Sirius Heir and ensured that he was protected from the worst of it that way but…" Regulus shook his head. "He still let us live in this house with them; with her." He shifted as though to dislodge the thought. "Then Sirius went to Hogwarts."*

"*He met my Dad." Harry realised where Regulus was going with the story.*

"*And James Potter did what I never could; he stood up for Sirius; stood by Sirius." Regulus grimaced, the twisting of his features distorting his sharply handsome features briefly. "I was so jealous of your father and I never forgave him for it."*

"*Because he took your brother away from you." Harry surmised.*

"*Sirius loved him." Regulus said simply.*

"*Sirius loved you too." Harry pointed out, a touch defensively.*

"*Yes, and I realised that too late." Regulus waved away the words. "I'm here because I'm standing up for Sirius now; standing by him now."*

*Harry frowned. "I don't think I understand."*

"*Sirius loves you." Regulus explained. "You hold his heart and his life in your hands. He will live for you and die for you." His grey eyes seared into Harry's. "You have the power to hurt him beyond measure."*

"*I'm not going to hurt him." Harry shot back. He glared at Regulus angrily. "I already promised I'm not going to sacrifice myself unless I absolutely need to and I got him to promise the same!"*

"*Good." Regulus said. "Just keep in mind that you are his world."*

*Harry wanted to be affronted but he couldn't berate Regulus for looking out for Sirius. "I love him too." He assured Regulus.*

*Regulus nodded. "Then do everything you can to live for him." His expression grew grave. "There is a challenge that you must face and your choice will determine both your fates."*

*Harry shivered reflexively.*

"*Just…" Regulus sighed. "Death sees all, every moment, every possibility. This is your boon as Death's Champion. Don't forget my words; promise me."*

"*I promise." Harry said fiercely. Because Regulus was protecting Sirius and Harry would do his best to keep his word because he loved Sirius too.*

*Regulus smiled. "Remember: where there is love there is life."*

Harry sighed as he heard the footsteps on the stairs. He had hoped Padfoot would have slept through Harry leaving his bedroom. He had hoped sneaking down to the living area would go unnoticed. "You have my room charmed, don't you?"

"Yep." Sirius sat down beside Harry on the den sofa and nudged his shoulder with his own. "Want to talk about it?"

Harry glanced over at his father, dimly lit only by the light of the slumbering fire in the hearth. Padfoot looked tired. His heart ached a little. Maybe Regulus had been right to be so protective. Harry knew there was no easy way to break who had been in the dream to his father.

"I met Regulus."

Sirius paled. "Ah."

Harry leaned against Sirius offering silent support. "He loves you. Says you raised him."

Sirius hummed under his breath. "We were all each other had for a long time." He sighed. "I have a lot of regrets about how we ended up but…I don't need a pair of socks."

Harry chuckled. "Don't worry; no socks."

"Well, that's a relief." Sirius said, nudging Harry again.

"He gave me a warning, I guess." Harry said, staring into the fire and remembering the sense of foreboding that had filled him with Regulus's words. "That I have a challenge to face and a choice to make."

"Didn't we already know that?" asked Sirius sounding genuinely confused.

"Maybe this is something more?" Harry shook his head. "He gave me the warning because he was protecting you."

"Hmmm." Sirius frowned.

"He said no-one stood up for you really until my Dad." Harry continued.

"He's right about that." Sirius agreed. "Well, in hindsight, I think Grandfather tried but…I don't think he knew how bad it was really for me with my parents. I didn't want people to know."

"I get that." Harry said softly.

Sirius winced and nodded. "I wish you didn't, but at least we have each other now."

Harry snuggled in closer and Sirius shifted to place an arm around his shoulders. Harry closed his eyes, safety and warmth stealing over him. *I promise, Regulus,* Harry thought muzzily as sleep tugged him into darkness, *I promise to do my best and live for him.*

o-O-o

Neville put his quill down and blew on the ink. He glanced around the classroom and wasn't surprised at the still bent heads and scribbling that was going on around him. There were only a few minutes left of the exam. Neville knew he was done.

Beside him Ron seemed frantically trying to answer one last question; Hermione was frowning as she checked through her answers; Blaise was done, a picture of relaxed contentment as he slouched in his chair, his eyes forward.

"That's it. Quills down." The Professor intoned sternly. "Leave your scrolls to the left of your desk. Tidy away your belongings and leave in an orderly fashion."

The groan of chairs being pushed back, the rustle of papers being tidied into position, and the rush as the entire year began to make their way from the room created a chaos of sound and movement.

Neville hung back in the corridor just outside the room until he was joined by Hermione and Ron. The Slytherin contingent fell in behind them as they started to make their way to the shared Common Room. It was becoming a regular thing after each exam and Neville was only disappointed that Harry didn't get to be part of it as he was excluded from the exams.

They all collapsed into the cushy sofas and smiled when mugs of hot chocolate appeared alongside a jug of pumpkin juice and a plate of biscuits. Neville dived for a mug and a biscuit, happily dunking the chocolate digestive into his drink before hurriedly eating it before it disintegrated.

Hermione had settled for a mug only and seemed to be staring into the chocolate depths despondently.

Neville hurriedly swallowed. "You can't have done that badly."

Hermione looked up as though startled and shook her head as she processed Neville's question. "I wasn't thinking about the exam."

"WHAT?!" Ron exclaimed loudly. "Blimey! Is the world ending?"

Hermione glared at him.

Neville coughed. "You have to admit you're usually pretty focused on debating the answers after an exam."

Hermione gave a huff but she stopped glaring. "I think we all have other things to worry about."

Neville did a quick check of the room. The only people there were in the alliance and a quick look to Blaise had the door locked and a privacy bubble established.

"We're clear." Blaise said, falling into the seat next to Neville.

Draco sniffed as though disinterested and took a sip of pumpkin juice.

"So what's on your mind?" asked Neville pointedly to Hermione, knowing it had to be big if she was worrying about it.

"I'm worried about Harry." Hermione said.

"We're all worried about Harry." Ron commented in agreement.

"Has anyone seen him today?" asked Neville.

"I saw him just before lunch." Lavender offered. "I cut across the courtyard and he was there with Professor Flitwick practicing duelling. He looked, well, fierce."

Parvati nodded, tucking a long strand of dark hair behind her ear. "I was with her. He was winning against the Professor."

"All he seems to do is practice fighting or go over plans for Saturday!" Hermione fretted, biting her lip. "He never seems to get the opportunity just to rest like we're doing right now! It's so unfair."

"I can't see Sirius accepting him working every hour of the day." Ron argued. "He's manic about looking after him."

"I know." Hermione sighed deeply. "I just…there's so much going on and I haven't seen very much of him. I'm spending all my spare time with the coven and working on the blessing…"

"Yeah, I know." Ron commented uncomfortably. "Dumbledore's had those of us chosen for that Hogwarts' spell Harry dreamed about together going over everything."

"There's another evacuation drill planned for Friday." Theo commented.

Neville nodded. "We all have our parts to play." Only his part wasn't entirely what everyone else thought…

*Neville was surprised to find a sleek black wolf sitting on the floor by his bed as he entered the boys' dorm. He was less surprised when a moment later it transformed into Harry.*

"*Wow. I can't believe you've got that form down so fast!" Neville exclaimed.*

"*Being the lion helped get the rest of it in place in my head." Harry said with a shrug. "You have a minute?"*

"*Sure," Neville said, "do you want me to get Hermione and the others or…" He wasn't sure where Hermione was – she'd disappeared after dinner with Professor McGonagall. Come to think of it, he hadn't seen Ron since dinner.*

"*Just us actually, Nev." Harry sat down on Neville's bed and Neville took a seat beside him. Harry waved at the dorm door and it closed soundly.*

*Neville raised a privacy bubble recognising that Harry would want one. "What do you need?"*

*Harry's lips twisted. "I've been having these dreams from the dead. Last night it was the Founders. Ron's in with Cedric, Luna and Draco being asked to take the Gryffindor role in a spell that might help protect Hogwarts."*

"*Alright." Neville felt a flicker of hurt that Harry had clearly chosen Ron but he pushed it aside. He knew as Harry's second he had an important job ensuring the evacuation of Hogwarts took place after the tournament task was done.*

"*I chose Ron because he is Gryffindor to me in lots of ways." Harry explained. "He's brave and he's reckless; he's courageous but he sticks his foot in his mouth a lot of times too."*

*Neville gave a chuckle. He couldn't deny that.*

"*You're equally as brave and courageous, and I was going to choose you but…I can't." Harry said plaintively.*

"*It's fine, Harry." Neville hurried to reassure his godbrother. "I know it wasn't an easy choice. Ron's your best mate and obviously you'd pick him…"*

"*I picked him because I can't pick you." Harry interrupted sharply.*

*Neville blinked bemused.*

*Harry sighed and met Neville's eyes fully. "You're the other possibility for the prophecy."*

*Neville swallowed hard. "I don't think that's the way it works, Harry."*

"*We both had the potential to be his downfall." Harry argued. "He's focused on me right now but he's going to remember you if I'm dead at his feet. He will come for you, Nev."*

"*You're so much more powerful than me!" Neville said, jumping up and pacing. "If you can't defeat him, how am I supposed to do it?"*

"*Because you'll stand up to him." Harry argued, rising to stand in front of Nev. "Because you'll defy him. Because you won't let him simply win and take the world he wants without a fight. Because I know you'll do these things not because of any prophecy but because you're you."*

*Neville couldn't speak; emotion clawed at his throat and stopped his breath short in his chest. Harry's green eyes were fierce and bright.*

"*Nobody can really know if I am the one prophesised." Harry said in a calmer tone. "Yes, there's a lot of weight to the argument it's me but…it's not a certainty. It could be argued that he Marked you the night his supporters destroyed your family in his name. You have such an affinity for plants that nothing like anything anyone else has; power he has not. I might be Death's Champion, I might have power but I might not be the One Trewlaney foresaw with the power to vanquish Voldemort. The prophecy might still be about the two of us not just me no matter what wizards think now – prophecies are just possibilities." He sighed. "If I die, I need you to believe it's you and do what I couldn't; because I need you…I need you to believe you're his Death if I'm not."*

*There was a long moment of silence but Neville didn't shift his gaze away from Harry. He slowly nodded.*

"*I'm his Death if you're not." Neville repeated.*

*Harry nodded, relief flowing over him and easing the lines on his face, his posture. "Thanks, Nev."*

"*I'm still expecting you to kill the bastard." Neville blurted out. "Just so we're clear."*

*Harry laughed. "I'm going to try." He grimaced and ran a hand through his hair. "It's…I hate thinking I have to kill someone."*

"*He's not human anymore. You're just destroying an evil remnant." Neville argued, sympathetic to Harry's discomfort and anguish. "Think of it that way."*

*Harry nodded again. "I should get back to my quarters. Sirius wanted me to have an early night since my sleep keeps getting interrupted."*

"*Sounds like a plan." Neville agreed, silently thinking Sirius was right to insist on the bedtime; Harry looked tired.*

*Harry made to leave, had gotten to the door when Neville called out to him and made Harry pause, one hand on the door handle, looking back over his shoulder.*

*Neville met his eyes solidly. "I'll be his Death if you fall. I swear it as your godbrother, Harry."*

"*I'm glad you're my godbrother, Neville." Harry said sincerely. "And I'm proud to be yours."*

"…and I think we should tell Harry that."

"Hmmm?" Neville came back with startled awareness and realised he'd missed some of the discussion. He blushed at Hermione's chiding look.

"I was saying we should go round tomorrow and drag him out to do something fun in the evening." Hermione said, a hint of reproach in her voice.

"It'd be good to spend time with him." Neville agreed.

"How about flying?" offered Draco. "He hasn't had a chance to use his broom with the Quidditch pitch out of operation."

"That's brilliant!" Ron said enthusiastically.

Neville shook his head a touch. The year before if anyone had ever told him Ron would ever say that about a plan proposed by Malfoy…

Blaise exchanged an amused look with Neville and leaned in. "I should have taken bets on that happening. I'd have made a fortune."

Neville grinned and tuned back into the conversation; the girls were arguing for staying in and playing board games but the boys were mostly for flying.

Hermione gave an annoyed huff, arms cross over her chest. "What do you think, Neville?"

"I think we should let Harry decide what he wants to do." Neville said firmly.

It was only a small thing but he thought Harry would appreciate the gesture of choosing something for himself. The prophecy…Harry had been burdened enough with choices outside of his control. But if Harry didn't make it – and Harry *would* make it, Neville was sure of it – but *if* he didn't make it, Neville would keep his promise.

*Don't worry, godbrother,* Neville silently thought, *I'm his Death if you're not.*

o-O-o

*22* *nd* */23* *rd* *June 1995*

*Harry was only slightly surprised to find himself in some kind of forest clearing.*

*It looked like a natural grove but the circle had different trees arrayed him which felt purposeful. Harry recognised some of them from his primary school nature education. Seven different types, Harry realised, as he counted. He knew they had specific meanings so he guessed the circle had been planted and wasn't natural.*

*He wandered over to the first tree and place a hand on its bark.*

"*It's a birch tree."*

*Harry whirled around at the sound of the voice and stared at the sight of his paternal grandfather; Charlus Potter.*

"*New beginnings and cleansing; a change." Another voice drew Harry's attention and he recognised Arcturus Black immediately.*

"*Grandfathers." Harry made a small bow.*

*Charlus and Arcturus returned the bow, but Charlus held out his arms and Harry moved forward to hug the man, feeling a little awkward.*

"*I haven't held you since you were a babe." His grandfather commented gruffly.*

*Arcturus waited a moment before he coughed. "Let the boy go, Charlus. We have much to get through and a short space of time to do it."*

*Charlus shot Arcturus a glare but he did ease back from Harry, settling his hands on Harry's shoulders momentarily to gaze at him. "You've grown into a wonderful young man, Harry. I'm very proud of you."*

"*We both are." Arcturus said gruffly.*

*Harry smiled shyly, pleased beyond words at the approval.*

"*And now onto business before Archie hexes me." Charlus said briskly.*

*Arcturus shot him another glare.*

"*Unfortunately your Grandfather Evans cannot join us here but we needed to bring you here because this is the beginning." Charlus said. "The family magic links us in a way unlike any other."*

"*It's the spirit and magic of everyone who has vowed to use it in defence of their family." Harry realised out loud, knowing without being told that he could in a blink have the grove filled with every individual involved.*

"*Exactly." Arcturus said with an approving nod. "Every time you call forth your magic, you call us forth."*

*Harry frowned. "Morgana Le Fey?"*

"*She gave her life in the first spell." Charlus explained. "She was the King's sister, married to Lot. Her twisted step-son, Mordred, believed the throne to be his if the King died; that he was the Heir. He killed Arthur and brought the downfall of Camelot. She stood with Merlin in this grove and sacrificed her life to rid the world of his evil."*

"*Your mother's sacrifice was powered by the family magic." Arcturus confirmed. "She is part of it now just as your father."*

"*The stories aren't wrong." Charlus said. "Camelot was gone and the world in disarray. Wizards and witches were being hunted because of the damage the final battle had wrought; dark wizards and witches plotted to take control. Here in this grove, Merlin called forth the most powerful wizards and witches of his time and they gave of their lives and magic to protect the world and cleanse it of evil."*

"*Birch," Arcturus pointed to the tree Harry had touched, "for new beginnings and cleansing; change."*

*Charlus gestured at the next tree. "Alder for creation."*

"*Gorse for healing." Arcturus offered, shifting to the next tree.*

"*Hazel for justice." Charlus said.*

*Arcturus pointed at a tree Harry recognised. "Rowan for protection."*

"*Oak for knowledge." Charlus smiled.*

"*And Blackthorn for spirit." Arcturus finished. "The families of those who were part of the spell were gifted with the ability to call the magic for protection and justice. They formed the first ruling Council."*

"*Sirius told me about the origins of the Wizengamot." Harry murmured.*

"*Politics." Arcturus said succinctly. "That came later."*

"*Merlin anchored the spell." Charlus shifted them back on topic. "He added an…addendum."*

"*None could call the entirety of the family magic." Arcturus said bluntly. "So much power would be dangerous to any one individual. Those in the first Council could only call the magic gifted by their own bloodline."*

"*But then…" Harry frowned, confused. Why did it feel like he could call it all?*

"*There was a hidden clause to the addendum." Arcturus said. "Only if one united the families in a common cause against evil would the family magic respond to the call of an individual."*

"*You carry Black and Potter blood." Charlus said. "You always had the power to call both family magics – as the incident when you were unborn showed. But when Voldemort was banished the first time, the families were united in relief."*

"*Even those who followed him were relieved once the initial fear of his defeat and the practical consequences faded." Arcturus explained.*

"*While it lasted but a moment, magic took note." Charlus added. "But what sealed it was the first Wizengamot you attended."*

*The memory of the Heirs sinking to one knee and swearing fealty came to Harry's mind and he saw both older men nodding their heads.*

"*Yes." Arcturus said with satisfaction. "The power of a people united against evil."*

*Charlus looked at Harry soberly. "The family magic can defeat Voldemort and you alone have the power to summon it."*

"*But not without price." Harry countered.*

"*A sacrifice of life and magic." Charlus agreed.*

"*So a last resort." Harry said firmly, remembering his promise to his mother; to Sirius.*

"*A choice." Arcturus corrected. "One we trust you to make."*

*Harry frowned again. Regulus had mentioned a choice to him; did this have something to with that?*

"*You'll know when you need to make it, Harry. Just as your father and mother knew when it was their time." Charlus smiled sadly. "Know we stand beside you every step of the way."*

*Arcturus nodded. "Where there is love there is life."*

*And a rush of wind blew through the grove and knocked the breath from him…Harry closed his eyes…*

His eyes snapped open and he took in a deep breath feeling as though he needed oxygen; needed air; as though he'd been on the edge of suffocating.

Hedwig hooted an alarm.

He wasn't surprised when a moment later the door burst open and Sirius hurried inside.

"Harry?"

"I'm fine." Harry cast a silent and wandless lumos which immediately gave the room a soft glow of light. He struggled into a sitting position just in time for Sirius to sit on the edge of the bed and cup his face with one hand.

"You're shaking." Sirius stated in a clipped tone. "These damned dreams…"

Harry let Sirius tug him into a gentle hold. He wanted the comfort of his father too much to resist. Sirius's hand stroked through his hair, down his back.

Safety.

He was safe.

"Do you want to talk about it?" asked Sirius softly.

Harry shook his head but he knew he was going to have to talk about it eventually. "In the morning."

"Alright. I'll leave you to get some more sleep."

Sirius pulled away but Harry caught hold of the edge of his pyjama top.

"Can Padfoot stay?" Harry asked.

Sirius nodded and immediately transformed. The big black Grim pushed his head into Harry's questing palm. Harry petted him for a few minutes before patting the end of the bed. The Grim jumped up, circled and settled down.

Harry felt the weight of the Grim across his legs. He extinguished the light and huddled back down, snuggling into his pillow. He was asleep almost instantly and missed the way the Grim and the owl exchanged a long look; the way the Grim stayed awake guarding his charge through the dark and endless night.

o-O-o

Remus stepped out on the top of Gryffindor tower and was immediately thankful that he'd chosen to wear a heavy cloak. He remembered all too well that the top of tower was on the most exposed Northern position. Even in the month that heralded the beginning of the Summer, the tower could be bitingly cold.

The temperature didn't seem to unsettle the lion sat lying along the top of the parapet as still as a Sphinx.

The wolf in Remus stilled a little in the presence of such a dangerous predator. He pushed back the reaction. "Harry?"

The lion looked over and seemed to duck its head a touch. The big cat got to its feet and jumped down from the wall. It loped over and between one step and another, the lion blurred and Harry stood in its wake.

Remus motioned over to a bench on the wall and they both made their way to sit down.

"Padfoot sent you, didn't he?" queried Harry with a short exasperated sigh.

"He said you were upset and weren't talking to him about it." Remus didn't even try to deny it. "He's worried about you."

Harry was quiet for a long while and Remus was about to concede that the youngest Marauder wasn't going to speak when Harry leaned forward, elbows on knees, hands clasped tightly.

"I met my grandfather and Sirius's." Harry said without preamble. "We stood in the grove where the family magic was created and they confirmed I have the power to call it to defeat Voldemort."

Remus wondered what about that had Harry so upset. "It's good we have confirmation?" He offered.

"They also confirmed it's a sacrifice." Harry snapped out.

Remus's eyes widened.

Harry shot to his feet and started pacing. "I mean, I meet my mum who tells me not to sacrifice myself unless it's the very last thing I do and now they tell me I can get rid of Voldemort, I just need to sacrifice…"

He cut himself off so sharply, halting his movement so suddenly, that Remus was surprised he hadn't sprained something.

"The thing is…Regulus warned me there would be a choice and not to hurt Sirius; to live for him." Harry said. "And…my grandfather said *this* would be a choice, and…" he swallowed hard, and covered his face.

Remus sprang up from the bench and swept the distraught teen into his arms. He hugged Harry to him. "It's going to be alright, Harry."

"I'm scared, Moony." Harry whispered.

"I know." Remus said, dropping a light kiss into his hair. "But it's going to be alright."

Harry shivered and Remus wrapped him up closer.

"I'm…I'm not scared to die, Remus." Harry said eventually. "I know there are people waiting for me who love me and who I love, but I'm not ready yet."

"We're not ready for you to die yet either." Remus confirmed. Just the thought of losing Harry made him sick to his stomach and he knew Sirius wouldn't last a moment without his son alive and well and whole.

"If there's a sacrifice to be made…" Harry began.

"It doesn't have to be you." Remus stressed. "I think that's what everyone beyond is telling you. You can choose that it isn't you."

Harry pushed back out of Remus's grip enough to look him in the eyes. "If not me, Moony, then…who?"

The question haunted Remus as he made his way back to the Black Estate in the late afternoon. He wandered into the steward's office and sat down in the leather chair with a sigh. He rubbed a hand over his scarred face and railed silently against the fact that Harry, his sweet cub, should have to make such a choice.

"He's fourteen." Remus whispered.

The mirror on the desk vibrated.

Remus picked it up and answered it with trepidation. Sirius's worried face swam into view.

"Padfoot." Remus said softly.

"He's gone up to bed for a nap." Sirius began before his face crumpled. "Moony…"

"He's struggling with a realisation, Padfoot." Remus wouldn't lie to his friend. "But he's working through it." He paused. "He just doesn't want to hurt you."

Sirius nodded briskly, but his silver eyes were bright with tears. "I don't know how to help him."

"You love him and you'll be there for him just like you have been all along." Remus instructed gently. "He's going to get through this."

Sirius sniffed and sighed heavily. "I still think plan A has its merits."

"I agree with you." Remus acknowledged lightly. Wrapping Harry in cotton wool and hiding away with him sounded great to him. "Anything on getting close to Voldemort?"

Sirius shook his head. "Snape confirmed there's a couple of Dementors hanging around where he is so…no. However, I did get an interesting letter just after Harry went to bed."

"Oh?"

Sirius held up a piece of parchment to the mirror. "From Wormtail."

Remus's brow lowered. "What does the rat want now?"

"The same covering his arse stuff." Sirius said. "He says he's been thinking about the night we brought Harry home and the promise we made. Rambles on a bit about how he only chose Voldemort to keep us all safe and how it's never too late for us to make the right choice."

"Bollocks to that." Remus said strongly. His grip tightened on the mirror. "He chose the wrong side, not us, and you want to know why I know that?"

"I'm going to guess you're going to tell me." Sirius commented dryly.

"Because Harry is going to kick his Master's scaly arse." Remus thundered out. "Because Harry cares. That's what's tearing him apart right now. Because he cares and he wants to make the best, the right choices when he's faced with them." He gestured, sending the image in the mirror out of focus. "I'm going to make a choice! I'm going to strangle the rat with my bare hands!"

Sirius gestured at him through the mirror. "That's not the choice Harry would want us to make."

It wasn't. Remus knew that. He could quite distinctly remember the way Harry the year before had argued against the two Marauders killing the third.

"No, it's not." Remus agreed. "He's a better man than us."

"I won't argue with that." Sirius said. He put the parchment down, his image wavering a touch. "It's strange, isn't it? How much our choices define us? I sometimes wonder what would have happened if I hadn't argued with the Hat for Gryffindor. Would I have gone to Slytherin? Would I have joined the Light against Voldemort?"

"You would have fought against him, Padfoot." Remus said firmly. "I don't believe there is a Sirius Black in all of creation that would have joined Voldemort."

Sirius gave a huff. "Well, right now, I'm going to choose to check on my son."

"'Bye, Pads." Remus said softly.

"'Bye, Moony."

Sirius's face disappeared leaving the mirror blank. Remus set it down.

Choices. That's what it all came down to at the end of the day. Wormtail had made his and it had led to the death of two of the best people Remus had ever known; two people he loved.

He was damned if it would cost him anybody else.

o-O-o

*23* *rd* */24* *th* *June 1995*

*Harry blinked at the sight of the Gryffindor boys' dorm.*

*It was empty but the five beds were arrayed in their usual position. Harry's was set out just the way he'd arranged it during the weekend he'd stayed over a month before. His school robes were set out on the chair; the bedside table held pictures – his friends and his family. He picked up one of himself and Sirius; the same picture he'd chosen for their portrait at Christmas.*

"*It's a good picture."*

*Harry spun around.*

*James Potter grinned at him.*

"*Dad!" Harry rushed forward, unsurprised when his father caught him and hugged him as tightly as his mother had done.*

*It was safety and love and home.*

*It felt the same and different to his hugs with Sirius.*

*His Dad swept a hand through Harry's hair, prompting Harry to inch backwards. For a long moment the two Potter men simply gazed at each other.*

"*You've grown up so much." His Dad commented, a touch of sadness in his voice.*

*Harry didn't know what to say.*

"*Your Mum and I…" His Dad sighed. "We had so many plans."*

"*Mum said." Harry murmured, remembering the list of life events his mother had listed.*

"*It's…it's not like we don't get to watch you but it's not the same." His Dad's hand rested heavily on his shoulder. "I wanted to watch you play Quidditch and shout at the ref from the sidelines. I wanted to be there when you asked me about the girl you liked – or the boy. I wanted to teach you the fine art of pranking. I wanted to hand you my cloak and tell you the tale of the Peverells."*

"*I wish…" Harry stopped unable to finish the sentence.*

*His Dad smiled knowingly. "I didn't lie the night in the cemetery, Harry. If I can't be there, I'm glad it's Pads. You're his son as much as mine. He's your Dad. Neither of you ever have to apologise for that."*

*Harry nodded. "We both miss you though." He thought Sirius actually missed James more than he did. Harry missed the idea of James rather than James himself whereas Sirius missed his friend, the brother of his heart.*

"*Guess that might be why we ended up here." His Dad glanced around nostalgia evident in his bright eyes. "Some very good memories were made in this dorm."*

"*For me too." Harry said, remembering the past three years. He might have needed his rooms with Sirius but he did miss the dorm – especially when the guys weren't drinking and coming up with insane theories.*

"*You've been upset since you talked to your Grandpas." His Dad sat down on the bed and patted the space beside him.*

*Harry sat down. "I think I'm going to have to choose between Sirius and me; I think I'm going to have to choose a sacrifice."*

*His Dad met his eyes squarely, serious and attentive. "And if you do have a choice?"*

"*He'd want me to choose him." Harry said succinctly. He knew that. Sirius would want him to live and Regulus had pointed out just how much it would hurt Sirius for Harry to die; Harry wasn't sure Sirius would live much beyond Harry's own death.*

"*Of course he would choose himself to sacrifice rather than you." His Dad agreed. "It's an easy choice when it's between you and your kid. I didn't even have to think about it." He sighed. "And I'm guessing that's why everyone in the afterlife is forcing you to think about it now."*

"*Because in the moment I wouldn't think, I'd just do it." Harry mused out loud.*

"*Wouldn't you? You or Sirius?" His Dad said bluntly. "Who'd you choose to take the hit?"*

*Himself.*

*He'd throw himself between Sirius and Death and…and that was the point of all the warnings; all of the urging to think about his choices.*

"*I don't want Sirius to die." Harry finally put into words the underlying issue he had with all the warnings.*

"*But you know he wouldn't want you to sacrifice your life for his." His Dad countered. "No parent wants to outlive their children, Harry. It's against the natural order of things. More, it would devastate him."*

"*I feel like everyone is trying to argue me into letting Sirius die!" Harry sprang up and stormed over to the window. The view was the usual one; the maze he would have to face nowhere in sight.*

*His Dad wandered over to him. "You know the thing I wanted to teach you most?"*

*Harry frowned and shook his head.*

"*Never to give up." His Dad said simply. He placed his hands on Harry's shoulders. "You already have the instinct in spades. I think it's genetic."*

*Harry felt a warmth spread through him at his Dad's words. He stared at their reflection in the window; his father behind him, hands on his shoulders, eyes meeting his in the window pane.*

"*I fell in love with your mother on the first train to Hogwarts. I didn't even know I had; I just knew she was it for me." His Dad smiled fondly. "I spent the next four years trying my hardest to gain her attention any way I could." His expression turned sheepish. "I may not always have gone about that the right way."*

*Harry smiled sympathetically. "Girls are hard."*

*His Dad smiled. "My fourth year was bad. It was the year most everybody started dating. All I wanted was one weekend with Lily. Either I was going to with her or I was going alone." He caught Harry's gaze meaningfully. "Two options. A choice; one or the other." He grimaced. "Then, my Dad sat me down and gave me a Talk."*

*Harry's lips twitched. "I saw Sirius's memory of you telling the Marauders about the Talk."*

*His Dad's eyes brightened with mirth. "It was the most excruciating conversation of my life." His expressions sobered a touch. "But it made me realise that I'd narrowed my focus too much. Lily and I…it didn't have to be either I had her as my girlfriend or I didn't. Once I stopped trying so hard at forcing a relationship with her, we actually became friends." He smiled widely. "And once we became friends, things developed from there."*

"*A third option." Harry said.*

*His Dad nodded. "You've already identified it for the prophecy. It doesn't have to be you or Voldemort, although that train is definitely in motion, there is the faintest possibility remaining that it could still be Neville who defeats him. So maybe it doesn't have to be you or Sirius." He held Harry's gaze. "Maybe what everyone is trying to tell you is that you don't have to sacrifice either of you."*

*Harry breathed out slowly, tension eking away from him and leaving him sleepy. A third way. He could find a third option. Something that didn't mean he'd lose Sirius or Sirius would lose him.*

"*Come on." His Dad ruffled his hair. "You should get to sleep."*

*Harry let himself be led over to his dorm bed and climbed in. His Dad tucked him in and Harry felt his heart squeeze in pain and loss for all the times his Dad should have tucked him in before and hadn't.*

*His Dad dropped a kiss on his forehead. "Sleep, Pronglet. There'll be no more dreams for now, I promise."*

*And Harry slept.*

It was the sun shining brightly on his face that woke him. He gave a groan and stretched. He pushed his hair out of his eyes and glared at the slit in the curtain that had allowed the sunlight to flood in. But for all his early awakening, Harry felt refreshed for the first time in a week. He gave a yawn and slid out of the bed.

He walked over to the window and pulled the curtains back. The view was different from the one in his dream since the maze stood where the Quidditch pitch should have been. Harry once again mourned the loss of the pitch.

It was finally the eve of the solstice.

The day of the third and final task of the Triwizard Tournament.

The day of his final battle with Voldemort.

Harry breathed in deeply, trying to still the nerves fluttering in his belly.

There were plans.

He was prepared.

And he'd find a way for both him and Sirius to survive the coming storm.

o-O-o

It wasn't a surprise that Sirius was dreaming.

It wasn't a surprise that he was dreaming of that night; reliving his worst nightmare; his worst reality…

*Wormy hadn't been where he was supposed to be and Sirius's gut said that the bluff had gone wrong; horribly, horribly wrong.*

*He pushed the motorbike faster, higher, through the clouds. He swore under his breath. He had set up the anti-apparation ward at the cottage himself. James had wanted another layer of protection and Lily had agreed on the proviso that they had an emergency portkey. Merlin, he hoped – well, he hoped they didn't need it but his gut was telling him they did and he hoped they'd used it.*

*He yanked the bike to the left and down as he caught sight of the lights of Godric's Hollow. His heart pounded in his chest fiercely.*

*He landed in front of the house and knew immediately.*

*The door was open.*

"*No." Sirius said, his mouth dry with fear. "No, no, no."*

*He dismounted and raced inside.*

*The sight of James undid him.*

"*Prongs." Sirius lurched against the door jamb before pushing off and propelling himself to the bottom of the stairs where James's body lay. He touched a trembling hand to James's neck, trying to feel for a pulse, but the truth of it was already blatantly obvious in the wide lifeless open eyes.*

"*James." Sirius sobbed the name, his hand cupping his friend's face tenderly. "James. Please, please."*

*A baby cried.*

*Sirius's head snapped around and up.*

*Another cry.*

"*Harry!" Sirius was on his feet and racing up the stairs.*

*He skidded into the nursery and was almost undone again when he spotted Lily's body in front of the crib. A pile of robes, expensive and chic, lay in front of her. He ignored it all to focus on the black-haired baby, the beautiful alive black-haired baby in the crib. He was so focused on the baby, he didn't see the mountain of a man beside the crib.*

"*Black." Hagrid stepped forward.*

"*Hagrid?" Sirius frowned, momentarily stunned by the sight of the Hogwarts' groundsman.*

*And Harry wailed.*

"*Harry." Sirius whispered hoarsely. One moment he was at the door, the next he was lifting the baby into his arms.*

*Harry clutched at him, sobbing his heart out; each wrenching cry tearing into Sirius's heart.*

"*It's alright, Pronglet." Sirius murmured, his voice choked with emotion. "It's alright. Uncle Pads has got you now. It's alright."*

*He hugged the child to him. Harry had been his world since his birth. The tiny bundle of life; so precious; so loved. All that was left of James and Lily.*

*He manoeuvred out of the nursery and onto the landing. He was faintly aware that Hagrid was following him as they descended the stairs and went out into the night.*

*Sirius hushed Harry and frowned at the blood streaked across Harry's forehead. He juggled the baby to reach for his wand, cleaning the blood from Harry's face and gently applying a healing charm.*

"*There, Pronglet. Isn't that better?" He frowned when the lightning bolt scar remained, but Harry's distress was easing; the red fading out of his cheeks as his sobs lessened into unhappy whimpers.*

"*Black." Hagrid cleared his throat noisily. "'ve orders from Dumbledore to take the lad to Hogwarts."*

"*Hmmm?" Sirius tried to focus on the half-giant. Had he spoken?*

*Hagrid gestured at Harry. "Dumbledore wants the lad safe. He said he's going to his aunt's, Lily's sister. Just needs to get checked out by Poppy first."*

*Sirius tried to make sense of the words. Dumbledore wanted Harry at Petunia's? He shook his head a touch. "He should stay with me." He didn't want to let Harry out of his sight. He had no idea how the baby had survived or where Voldemort had gone after killing James and Lily, and he didn't care. He just wanted to protect his godson; do the job he'd promised his friends he'd do in their stead if anything ever…*

"*You're his guardian then?" Hagrid said, visibly confused. "'Cos Dumbledore seemed pretty sure he should go to his aunt's."*

*Sirius rubbed Harry's back soothingly. "No, I'm…Frank and Alice…" he swallowed hard against the rush of emotion as he realised anew James and Lily were dead and weren't ever going to raise Harry, "Frank and Alice are his guardians, Hagrid."*

"*Well, they're still in 'iding." Hagrid said scratching his beard. "Maybes Dumbledore thinks this aunt's the best place until they can take him?"*

*That was probably true. Nobody would look for Harry in the muggle world. And hadn't Lily said there were blood wards around her sister's place? Placed illegally but they existed and would protect Harry well until Frank and Alice were located.*

*Sirius sighed and dropped a kiss on Harry's head. He really didn't want to let go of the little man.*

"*You could come with us as far as Hogwarts." Hagrid offered gruffly. "See the lad's alright."*

*Sirius shook his head. The Fidelius was down. Wormtail had given up the secret. Sirius didn't know if the rat's betrayal was voluntary or not but he was beginning to think he'd been very stupid about who the traitor in the Order was. He had a rat to hunt and bring to justice.*

*He dropped another kiss on Harry's head. His godson would be safe with Hagrid and if he was going to find Wormtail he needed to get going while the trail was fresh. He shifted so he was looking directly into Harry's eyes.*

"*Uncle Padfoot has to go now, Pronglet, but I will see you as soon as I'm done. You'll go with Hagrid and be a good boy." Sirius stroked a finger down Harry's plump cheek. The baby gurgled up at him.*

*It was a wrench to let him go but Sirius shuffled so he could place the baby in Hagrid's hands.*

"*Careful." Sirius instructed. "Get Poppy to check out that scar on his forehead, Hagrid."*

"*I will." Hagrid promised.*

*They both looked back at the house.*

*Sirius swiped at his face, at another rush of hot tears.*

"*Sorry about James and Lily." Hagrid offered roughly. "They were good people."*

"*The very best." Sirius agreed.*

*Hagrid gave a nod and started to amble off down the lane. Sirius frowned.*

"*Where are you going?" Sirius called out to him.*

*Hagrid stopped and turned back. "Only 'ad a one-way portkey. Need to find the local to use the floo."*

*Sirius scowled. "Harry's injured, Hagrid." He hurried over and pressed his keys into Hagrid's free hand. "Take my motorbike."*

*Hagrid brightened. "That's right kind of you." A moment later and he was mounted, the bike soaring up into the night sky.*

*Sirius shivered in the cold night air. He took a few steps over to the garden and blew up a single stone; the anchor for the apparition ward. It was time to hunt a rat. He turned sharply and left with a crack.*

*He landed in the cemetery.*

*Sirius wobbled but corrected himself straight away. He was dreaming, he reminded himself. He was dreaming and that was why he'd landed in the cemetery in front of his friends' graves rather than finding himself on the trail of the rat.*

*He crouched down and ran his fingers over the words he'd added to the stone: 'where there is love there is life'.*

"*And you are both so loved." Sirius whispered. "Harry's incredible and I'll not apologise for keeping him here with me. I know you're so very proud of him because I am."*

"*As you rightly should be, my Grim."*

*Sirius shivered and stood. A dark hooded figure stood in front of him. "Death, I presume?"*

*The hooded figure bowed their head. "I miss you by my side."*

"*Then you should have thought twice about making an innocent boy your Champion." Sirius snapped out. There was a sense of knowing, of familiarity. A hint of timeless eons spent beside a cloaked figure; of protecting innocent souls as they went beyond; of standing against evil.*

"*You stood for him then; you stand for him now." Death said simply.*

"*I will always stand beside him." Sirius said firmly. "He's the son of my soul."*

"*He is my Champion." Death said.*

"*He's fourteen and facing a fight for his life; for the lives of his friends and his loved ones." Sirius argued. "He should be playing Quidditch and having fun, not fighting evil."*

"*He is special, the last of the Peverells; the Master of the Hallows." Death countered. "He was always destined to meet the one who tries to flee my grasp. His power would have attracted Riddle like honey attracts a bee."*

"*I'd rather you said like a moth to a flame." Sirius muttered.*

"*Perhaps you are not wrong." Death replied. "I sent you to him for a reason."*

*Sirius studied the figure for a long moment. "You've loaded the dice."*

"*I gave my Champion everything he needed; everything he needs." Death said. "He is, after all, my Champion, my Grim."*

Sirius came awake with a gasp.

He shuddered violently with cold. He huddled underneath his covers for a long moment, struggling to hold onto the remnants of his dream. He'd been reliving the awful night in 'eighty-one and then…something to do with the cemetery? It was all hazy. It didn't matter.

The sun was up, Sirius realised, as he took in the edge of light around the curtains. He hadn't been alerted by Harry's bedroom charm so his son must have slept the night through for the first time in a week.

James, thought Sirius with satisfaction. Harry had said it would be James who would be his last visitor before the battle and clearly James had done the right thing and ensured his son – their son – had gotten a good night's sleep.

Sirius stretched and stayed still, content to doze. He wasn't unduly alarmed when the charm sounded to tell him Harry was up. It was early but it was still more sleep than Harry had achieved any other night.

Sirius slipped out of bed. It was going to be a long day and it would be good to get a head start. He smiled grimly. There would a battle to fight, a war to win, and Sirius was going to ensure Harry survived to see the next sunrise.

o-O-o

Thomas could see the sunrise from the bed. Peter had forgotten to draw the curtains the night before and the wash of light had woken him from his slumber. His temporary body ached badly and Thomas knew that the end of the day would see him in a new vessel one way or another.

The way he wanted, Thomas reminded himself. He would gain a new body the way he wanted.

Severus had done an outstanding job on the potion. It had been completed and was in stasis. It looked exactly as it should. Thomas could admit to himself that he was inwardly pleased he hadn't had to rely on Peter to brew it. Made badly the potion would still restore him but perhaps not to his former glory. Severus's involvement ensured that his new body would be just as good as his old.

Better.

Thomas stretched and winced anew at the pain seeping into every joint; the itchiness of his skin which was blistering with lesions and sores. He had only a few wisps of hair remaining on his head. The possession had damaged the frail human body of the child badly.

Only a few more hours, he promised himself; only a few more hours and he would be able to walk upon the ground; he'd be able to stand tall; cast his magic without fear of using so much he'd lose control of his body.

Freedom.

He would be able to bathe and feed himself rather than relying on one of his servants. He would be able to walk and breathe air with his own nose; his own mouth. He would be able to speak with his own voice.

The longing was intense and almost angered him; he wanted it so much he could almost taste it.

Twilight.

That's all he had to wait. The ritual was best done at the finish of the day; under the cover of dark. It was a mere few hours. He had waited over a decade; he could wait those few hours. He would have his body back and then it would be time to reclaim his life.

He would kill the one who had condemned him to his years in the wilderness: Harry James Potter.

His face screwed up into a scowl.

The boy was proving to be a worthy nemesis. Potter had survived the Triwizard Tournament; he had survived his run-ins with Bartemius. Potter seemingly had risen to the challenge.

All the better for when he lay dead, Thomas thought viciously. When he crushed the boy beneath his feet; when he executed him, no-one would be able to deny Thomas's power. He would rule, and the wizarding and muggle worlds would burn; they'd pay for every slight and every hurt Thomas had suffered.

Only a few more hours.

Only a few more hours and he would rise again and destroy all those who would stand against him.
