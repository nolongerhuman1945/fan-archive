# First Jump

It took three days of experimentation before they figured it out. The watch responded to intent. You had to *want* to go somewhere, and you had to have a clear image in your mind of where—or rather, *when*—you wanted to be.

On the fourth day, Sam decided they were going to try it.

"Just a few minutes," they said, holding the watch. "I'll go back five minutes, prove it works, and come right back."

"Sam, this is a terrible idea," Maya warned. "We have no idea what this could do. What if you get stuck? What if you can't come back?"

But Sam was already twisting the watch's crown, focusing on five minutes ago, when they'd been in the kitchen getting a drink.

The world *bent*.

It wasn't like in movies, where everything spun in a blur. It was more like reality was a sheet of paper, and someone had just folded it. Colors inverted. Gravity shifted. Sam's stomach did a flip that had nothing to do with motion sickness.

And then they were standing in the kitchen, watching their past self reach into the refrigerator.

"Whoa."

The past Sam didn't notice them. They walked right past, carrying a can of soda, completely oblivious. Present Sam followed them into the living room, watching as past Sam sat on the couch.

Five minutes. That's all they'd gone back. Five minutes. But it was real. It was actually happening.

When the five minutes were up, reality folded again, and Sam was back in the present. Jake and Maya were staring, mouths open.

"Did it work?" Jake asked.

Sam nodded, still reeling. "It worked. I was there. I saw myself. It's real."

The three friends looked at each other, and in that moment, they all knew: this changed everything. They had the power to go anywhere in time. To see anything. To change anything.

What could possibly go wrong?
