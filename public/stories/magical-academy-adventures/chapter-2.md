# First Day at Academy

The journey to the Academy took three days by carriage, three days of wondering what lay ahead. When the great stone walls finally came into view, Alex's breath caught in their throat.

The Academy of Arcane Arts was nothing like they'd imagined. It was *more*.

Towers spiraled toward the sky, some ending in floating platforms that drifted slowly through the air. Bridges connected buildings at impossible angles, and everywhere, students moved between classesâsome walking, some floating, and at least one young woman who appeared to be turning into mist.

"First year?"

Alex turned to find a girl with bright green hair and a warm smile standing beside them.

"I'm Maya," she said, extending a hand. "Second year. I'll show you around."

Relief washed over Alex. "I'm Alex. And yes, first year. I'm... a bit overwhelmed."

Maya laughed, a sound like bells. "Everyone is on their first day. Come on, let's get you sorted."

The sorting ceremony was unlike anything Alex had expected. They stood in the Grand Hall, surrounded by other new students, while four professors sat at a raised dais. In the center of the hall, an ancient crystal hummed with power.

"Place your hand on the crystal," instructed Professor Thorne, a stern-looking woman with silver hair and eyes that seemed to see right through you.

Alex stepped forward, and as their hand touched the cool surface, light exploded around them. Colors swirledâdeep blues, vibrant greens, flashes of gold and silverâand then coalesced into a single symbol above their head: a swirling vortex of stars.

"The House of Stars," Professor Thorne announced, and the hall erupted in whispers.

Maya was waiting when Alex stepped away, her grin wide. "House of Stars! That's rare. Only a few students each year get sorted there."

"What does it mean?" Alex asked.

"It means," Maya said, pulling them toward the dining hall, "that you're going to have a very interesting year."

As they walked, Alex couldn't help but feel that the real adventure was just beginning.
