“What’s wrong? Is it the face?”

Toshinori continued to peer at his enemy’s face with disgust, taking in the marred tissue that dared to make him spew his lunch out onto the table, **“I’ll admit, it’s a part of it.”**

“Hm, well, I’m sorry to say getting your head blown off does that to a man.”

**“Fair enough. By the way, obvious question here, but would you mind telling me how you survived that?”**

“Come now, I can’t give away all my secrets. But, if it’s any consolation to you, it was barely and practically by miracle. Not to mention it hurt like Hell.”

**“Mm, I guess that makes me feel a little better. But, can’t you change it? Cause that’s distracting.”**

“The face-molding quirk, a classic. Unfortunately, now useless to me.” All For One’s face began to contort, his skin rippling as his flesh struggled to shift around. His skin finally settled, nothing changing aside from a flap on his right side opening. One piercing red eye appeared, an eye that Toshinori could never forget. “It can’t change scars, so with the state my face is in, the quirk can’t do much for me. I can’t even see out of this eye now. Last time I used it was in our fight. You remember, right? I turned into Ms. Shimura, cut my own throat. Good times.”

**“Mm, good times. I especially liked the part directly afterwards, where I impaled my fist straight through your torso.”**

All For One nodded, his eye disappearing, “Indeed, but I got my payback later. Speaking of which, you’re looking good, considering. Better than me, at least. What’s your secret? David Shield?”

**“Eh, you already know I look like shit underneath all this too.”**

“At least you can hide it. Ah, look at us, both decrepit, tired, and not long for this world. Well, one of us, that is.”

Toshinori scoffed, **“Big claim for a man with a back-up plan.”**

“Oh, hello Pot, the name’s Kettle. Have we met?”

**“No, that’s the big difference between us. I called Shigaraki a back-up plan, because that’s all he is to you. I have a protege.”**

“Aw, that’s touching. But, despite what you may think, I’ve formed quite the strong bond with Young Tomura after all these years. He’s even gifted us this evening together.”

All Might slumped back into his chair, grumbling under his breath, **“Ugh, of course that was a part of the plan.”**

“Au contraire. None of this was a part of the plan. I didn’t expect you and I to clash again for a while. In fact, I was hoping to wait until One For All extinguished from your body for good, to make it easy for me. However…” All For One got up from his seat, taking his breathing mask with him and moving towards the wall of screens, “One of my associates has been overseeing Young Tomura’s work tonight; work that he did not fill me in on. I decided to see what he was up to and watch the camera feed for myself. As it turns out, Young Tomura has outdone himself. Not following the plan is exactly according to *my* plan.”

Toshinori watched as the static turned into images of what looked like the inside of a school. The first thing he noticed was Shigaraki, Katsuki’s throat in hand. But, directly behind them, was the crazy couple themselves. Izuku and Kyouka followed along behind the villain, with both looking less than happy. In many of the shots, Kyouka looked downright pissed. 

*‘Ooooh shit.’*

“It seems my ward has taken a particular interest in yours. I mean, not that it’s perplexing. We’ve pitted them against each other in our game, it was bound to happen. However, what is unusual is whatever he’s doing. Tomura unfortunately kept whatever they were talking about in rooms with no cameras; a detail he must’ve planned for. Except, that is, the rooftop cameras. He’s had quite the interesting youth, that boy of yours. From what I could infer, anyway. But, point being, it was Tomura who gave them my location, and subsequently you. He’s thrown me to the wolf.”

**“He betrayed you?”** Toshinori asked, brow raised.

“In a sense. Rather, he’s decided to take the reins. He feels it’s time I stop holding his hand and let him take charge. Which was always the plan, but he’s taken true initiative; more than I anticipated. He’s gone ahead and given himself the promotion ahead of time.”

Toshinori rolled his eyes, **“You taught him your underhanded and slimey ways. You must be so proud.”**

“Oh, very much so. I did a better job at raising him than I thought. Believe it or not, I think he’ll become far more successful under my tutelage than anything his parents would have done for him.”

**“And where are they? He knows you killed them?”**

“Me? I’m grateful that my reputation precedes me, but no. I didn’t kill them. However, I do think you’d be very interested in who they were.”

**“...Why’s that?”**

“Ah, tsk tsk. Not yet. I want to savor the moment. I want the whole world to see your face when I tell you. Speaking of which…” All For One turned back to Toshinori, placing his mask over his head and around his neck, taking a deep breath as his airways finally cleared up. He straightened out his suit, nodding towards the table. “Are we ready?”

Toshinori stood up, rolling his shoulders back, “Whenever you are.”

  
  
  
  
  

***…~AMP~...***

  
  
  

**(** **Near Kamino Ward; Yokohama. Top of Rooftop Near City Square** **)**

  
  

Kyouka gazed down at the rooftop just below them, seeing the large, neon Yokohama sign. The streets were absolutely packed with traffic, dozens of police and Pros doing their best to move people along. No matter what happened, they had at least saved plenty of lives by telling All Might about the warehouse.

Or, technically Tomura-...No, she wasn’t gonna give him even a little credit for this. It’s not like it mattered to him.

She flinched as her jacks were hit with thunder; looking up to see dark clouds gathering in the sky and cover the stars. Grasping her jacks to cover them, she turned to Izuku, nodding down to the sign below.  “...Welp, this is gonna be difficult to explain to our parents.”

“Hmhmhm, yeah, sorry about that.” Tomura moved towards the edge of the roof, shoving Katsuki down to his knees. “It’s a bit of a field trip, but I figured we’d all wanna watch this. Even you, Bakugou.”

“Watch wha-?”

***\*BOOM!!!\****

They all jumped as a massive plume of debris and smoke exploded into the sky. The cracking of concrete and snapping of explosions breaking the sound barrier echoed into the night, a hotel collapsed at the foundation. Story by story the building fell in on itself until it reached the ground, with thick dust clouds filling up the nearby streets.

The traffic below either began to panic or stare and scream at the distant destruction. 

“The end of an era.” Tomura smiled, letting the air from the shockwaves brush over him. He pulled out his phone with his free hand, typing out a quick message.

**\[Tomura\]: Go ahead and send our gift over.**

  
  
  
  

***…~AMP~...***

  
  
  

**(** **Kamino Ward: Outside of League of Villains Dive Bar** **)**

  
  

*“The Hell was that?!”* 

Tsukauchi shared the same sentiment as the panicked Mt. Lady over the walkie-talkie. The comms lines were almost unintelligible after the massive explosion in the distance, along with the complete collapse of the Ventress Hotel Plaza. 

Whatever All Might was up to, he had to trust him to do his job. They would do theirs.

Tsukauchi grabbed his radio, getting up from his seat, “It’s a separate matter, All Might’s already on it. No more waiting! Everyone move in!”

*“...Uh, Detective? That’s gonna be a bit of a problem.”*

Tsukauchi looked up at the other Pros, his stomach dropping, “Why, Mt. Lady?”

*“You know how we’re supposed to be the ones breaking in? Well, now a bunch of Nomu are breaking out.”*

“...Fuc-” 

*\*KRAASCH!!!\**

The window crashed open, a smaller, winged Nomu busting into the apartment. Tsukauchi fell to the ground as it swiped at him. Before he could pull out his gun, an inferno melted the top half of the nomu away, leaving the charred corpse to fall at the detective’s feet. 

He looked back, seeing Endeavor’s flames vanish against his skin. He grumbled as Edgeshot jumped out the window, with Best Jeanist not far behind. “Whatever All Might’s doing, it better be worth it if he left us to waste our time on these creatures.”

“Trust me,” Tsukauchi sighed as he stood back up, grabbing his gun. “After tonight, we’ll all be in his debt…Well, even more in his debt.”

  
  
  
  
  

***…~AMP~...***

  
  
  
  

**(** **Kamino Ward** **)**

  
  

Whatever was left of the old factory was barely holding on my scraps of metal. The parking lot, along with a few city blocks, was a barren wasteland. The nearby shopping plaza took the brunt of the impact, but it seems like he had nicked the nearby hotel. 

All For One coughed as the dust cleared, tossing a bathtub that must’ve come from the hotel off of him. A light rain began to drizzle down on them, far off thunder clapping in the distance. He looked around, his senses almost completely overwhelmed by the crumbling debris and distant screams.

That was the keyword, though. 

Distant.

“Hahaha! I should’ve known…” A steel support beam flew through the dust, leaving All For One’s rivets to shoot out of his fingers and catch it. “You evacuated the area. You’re no fun.”

Toshinori walked through dust, cracking his knuckles, **“Collateral damage never mattered to you before.”**

“I usually don’t care, but innocents getting in the way would make you sick.”

**“Believe me, your presence is enough!”** In a blue blur Toshinori was on him, fist driven straight into All For One’s diaphragm. They flew across the street, crashing into a still-standing laundromat. Through the appliances All For One was slammed into the back wall, an uppercut rocketing into his face as he was fired through the ceiling and into the air above.

Toshinori seethed as he looked down at his aching fist, blood dripping from his knuckles. **“The hell…?”**

“Impact Recoil!” Toshinori looked through the hole in the ceiling, seeing All For One levitating above. “Do you like it? I didn’t have this one the last time we fought.”

**“Is it too much to ask that you could’ve just been really lazy these last six years and didn’t get that many quirks?”**

“Oh, not too many. But, you know me…” All For One’s arms began to grow, the sleeves of his suit jacket barely able to contain them. Rivets and Spear-like bones stabbed through the sleeves, spiking out of his knuckles as black lightning crackled off of the tips. Multipliers, Spring-like Limbs, Kinetic Boosters, Brawn Boosts. The good doctor told him not to expend himself too much, but how could he resist? “I’m a fan of the classics.”

All For One’s “Ignition” sparked to life behind him; combined with his multipliers he launched towards the ground at blinding speeds. All Might reciprocated, jumping up into the air, the shockwave he left behind destroying the laundromat. 

The titans collided in the air, their impact ringing throughout the city. The windows in the plaza all shattered, the buildings beginning to crack under the pressure of the shockwave. They fell away from each other, both hit by the other’s respective punch, but Toshinori could feel his arm aching from the Impact Recoil. 

All For One managed to stop his fall by levitating, shooting his Air Cannon at the descending Toshinori. All Might crash-landed in the shopping plaza, immediately tackled by All For One and his Ignition. They slammed through small shop after small shop until eventually they were up in the air, heading towards the city.

“This is almost sad, All Might!” All For One yelled over the wind, the spear-like bones protruding from his hand being held back by All Might “Two old and worn out men, still trying to settle a score after all this time!”

**“I already did settle it! You’re the one that crawled back for seconds!”** All Might headbutt the villain, twisting All For One around to redirect their flight path into a nearby skyscraper, slamming him against the building. 

All Might careened and uppercut into All For One’s diaphragm, shooting him up the building, his body crashing through windows and concrete like a speedboat in water. All Might got his footing through one of the windows, jumping up after him. 

He slammed into All For One just as he got above the building, sending them almost to the clouds above. Punch after punch, his hits could be heard echoing across the city. **“Why! Couldn’t! You! Just! Stay! Dead!”**

All For One’s Impact Recoil activated, repelling All Might’s fist back. His black lightning shot through All Might as he slammed his fist into against his cheek. He aimed his Air Cannon directly at All Might’s old wound he had graciously gifted him years ago. 

Toshinori slammed onto the skyscraper’s rooftop, recovering quickly, despite the pain. 

All For One levitated in the air, wheezing as he held his diaphragm. “He-...Hehehe. I suppose you’re not fighting if you’re not fighting dirty. Hm?”

The sound of chopper blades filled the air, the news helicopter nearing their battle.

  
  
  
  

***…~AMP~...***

  
  
  

*~”We’re looking at what appears to be All Might himself, in a devastating battle with…”~* They all watched as All For One slowly crane his neck to look up at the helicopter, facing the camera as it zoomed in on him. *~”...Who the Hell is that?”~*

Izuku looked down at the streets below, the jumbotron showing the newsfeed to the public. He had seen All For One before, in the memories. He watched him fight, and saw just how destructive he was. 

But, seeing him now? In the waking world? 

He didn’t think he had ever been more terrified.

He didn’t have eyes, but Izuku was almost certain he was looking straight at him through the screen. His eyes glanced down, seeing Kyouka’s hands shaking a little. He had told her the same boogeyman stories All Might had told him, and he had recounted the memories with her. 

She was one of the only people on Earth who understood what they were seeing. Everyone across the world watching the news didn’t know it, but this was the closest they were to watching the Devil himself emerge before their eyes.

Kyouka understood that; they made it clear to her when she joined in on all of this. Izuku wasn’t sure what was running through her mind first. Fear for the world, for herself, for her parents, for him. 

Probably all of the above. 

He took her hand in his, feeling her grip back tightly; almost desperately. 

“I know, he doesn’t look so good,” Tomura sighed as he moved up next to them. “Trust me, it’s even worse in person.”

“Wh—…” Katsuki started, the only person on that rooftop completely lost. Even despite that, he would never admit it, and Izuku would never blame him for it, there was a slight shake in Katsuki’s voice.  “Who the hell is that?”

Tomura chuckled, leaning down to Katsuki’s ear, “...That’s the world’s mistakes catching up to ‘em.”

  
  
  

***…~AMP~...***

  
  
  
  

“Ah, the local news!” All For One laughed out, looking back to All Might as he raised his hand out towards the helicopter. “I think they want an interview, All Might!”

The helicopter suddenly lurched forward, the pilot panicking as the controls began to violently work against him. The helicopter flew right at All Might, flipping over so that the blades were coming right for him. Toshinori ran forward, sliding under the helicopter as it zoomed over to where he had been standing. He flipped around, grabbing onto the landing skids, trying to keep them from crashing. 

But, his hairs stood on end, the pressure in the air changing as the high-pitched whirring of All For One’s Air Cannon echoed around. Toshinori threw the helicopter away, praying that they would be able to regain control as he was hit directly by the Air Cannon. 

All Might slammed through the roof, crashing through dozens and dozens of stories until he hit the bottom, the windows and doors blowing off the building from his impact. 

Toshinori coughed up dust, trying to get up as his body ached. His coughs reverberated throughout the lobby, along with the screams of those still trying to evacuate the building. Steam pillowed around his figure, doing his very best to hold on. 

He had spent too much time at the station and in the raid hideout in this form. But, he could hold out, just a little longer.

As he leaned against a chunk of rubble, felt something warm drip onto his hand. Toshinori gasped as he saw blood on his hand, a product of the crushed man under the debris from All For One’s blast. 

**“No…”** All Might frantically looked around, finding himself in some sort of business’ front lobby. Scattered around were either dead or wounded, either crushed by falling rubble, hit in the blast, or had fallen from the massive hole going hundreds of feet in the air. **“No, no, no…”**

*“Al-...All Mi-...”*

Toshinori turned around, seeing a woman stuck under a granite pillar. People were ignoring her, rushing around her to get to the door. He rushed over, throwing the pillar aside, gingerly taking her in his hands. Her legs were clearly broken, but she’d live. She was one of the very lucky few. **“I’m so sorry.”**

“Aw, isn’t that sweet.” All Might scowled, his piercing blue eyes turning around to see All For One levitate down to the ground floor. He sighed, his Rivet Stab generating from his fingers. “Well, might as well put her out of her misery now.”

**“GRRAAAH!!!”** Just as his Rivet Stab was about to make its way towards them, he was punched in the face, sent flying back towards the back wall. **“No more! No more people! I won’t let you!”**

All For One wheezed out a laugh as he regained his footing, “All Might, my friend…You can’t comprehend just how many more there’s going to be. If you’ve moved everyone away from the fun, let’s bring it to them.”

He raised his arms up, all of his strength quirks and multipliers coursing through his muscles, striking down against the floor. All Might grabbed the woman and was out of the building in an instant, the impact shaking the earth beneath the building. He grabbed as many people as he could, using his speed to rush everyone to the already arriving first responders.

He turned around, ready to go back to the building, but was met with the sounds of creaking metal and crackling concrete. **“No…”**

The skyscraper began to tilt to the side, falling towards the city center. Not only did there have to be dozens, if not hundreds still in the building, but traffic from the evacuation had to still be heavy. 

Toshinori scrambled back inside, his blinding speeds allowing him to grab whoever he could on the first few floors, but even at his pace it wouldn’t be enough before the building fell. He ran outside to the top of the nearest building the skyscraper was falling towards. He could at least give whoever was still inside both buildings more time.

**“Really putting this old body to the test here!”** All Might spread his arms out, stopping the building from hitting the buildings below.

Which worked…for about five seconds.

He watched as the center of the skyscraper began to crack, splitting the building in two from where he was supporting it, with the upper-half continuing to fall. **“Urgh, why can’t it work like in the cartoons?!”** 

“Well, would you look at that?” All For One floated nearby, watching the second half of the building continue to fall towards the ground, threatening to crush the retreating citizens below. “Don’t worry, All Might. Let me help.” 

He raised his arm up, air pulsing from his arm and shooting into the building. The plummeting skyscraper was blown into hundreds of bits, shredding away any hope of any possible lives left inside. What remained was the equivalent of a meteor shower, raining concrete and rebar onto the streets below.

“Whoops. Ah, no matter, I’ll clean it up.” He fired off towards the city center, stopping to hover above the massive collection of cars and citizens. Chunks of skyscraper had crushed cars, landed in the middle of the wide sidewalks, or struck through the sides of buildings and shops all around. Hundreds of civilians either gawked up in terror, and others tried their best to fruitlessly run for their lives. All For One lowered to the ground, his hand raising out towards the giant intersection.

His Air Cannon began to pulse out of his arm, but he was suddenly knocked out of the way by All Might, catching up from dealing with the other building. But, he was just a second off, with All For One flying to the side with his Air Cannon still going off. It hit one of the digital billboards, blowing it off the building and sending it falling towards the streets below.

Toshinori rushed over, catching it before it fell on anyone, but was immediately shot with All For One’s Air Cannon. All Might coughed violently as he tumbled back, along with citizens and cars alike. He did his best to shield anyone near him, feeling his body weaken. 

“Ohoho, this gives me an idea.” All For One walked towards where the four city streets merged, gazing around the open area. “Let’s see how many people you can protect with your own body. Self-sacrifice is all a part of the job.” 

Air Cannon pulsed from his arm, but All For One quickly aimed it down the other road at the retreating people. He fired, but as expected, Toshinori got in the way. The blast hit him, sending him back, saving hundreds in the process. 

“Hahaha! That’s one point for you. Now, let’s see how many it takes before I hit someone…”

  
  
  
  
  

***…~AMP~...***

  
  
  
  
  
  

Izuku watched as the destruction continued in the distance, his foot tapping frantically as hundreds of screams echoed into the night. The crack of Air Cannon went off again, and again, and again.

Windows shattered, buildings groaned under the pressure of their lower floors crumbling away. Dust and smoke rose high into the air as All Might gave so many time to make a run for it. All For One was just having his fun at that point. He kept reusing Air Cannon, using a minimal effort as he could to tire All Might out. 

Unfortunately, it was working.

“We…We have to help. Somehow.”

  
“Eh, I wouldn’t do that if I were you,” Tomura advised. “He sees you of all people, he’ll absolutely kill you. I can’t protect you if you leave.”

“I refuse to say he has a point,” Kyouka side-eyed Tomura, putting her hand on Izuku’s arm. “But, if we try to help, we’re dead in an instant. And, if we’re not, All Might will put all his focus on protecting us. We just gotta trust him.”

“We could save someone… *Anyone* …”

“Not everyone gets saved, believe me.” Tomura hummed as he watched his master give another shot of his cannon, this one no longer contained. It eviscerated the city streets, ripping them from the ground and blowing any building in its wake away. Tomura saw the newscopter finally return over the horizon line. Those guys sure had some balls, huh? Or a lack of brain cells. Either way, he knew what this meant. 

His master was ready to unveil the truth.

  
  
  

***…~AMP~...***

  
  
  

All For One felt the helicopter approach from above, his smile widening even further. 

“Ah, right on time. Let’s take a look at my handiwork…” A thick wall of dust rose dozens of meters high, the sound of crashing concrete filling the air as his destruction began to settle. He could sense All Might’s coughs, his unmoving form standing hunched over. “Oh, come now, don’t be shy. Show the world…”

The dust finally cleared, showing the barren wasteland that once was a lively, populated street. Chaos and death were all that remained, outside of one lonely man. A man that few recognized. That is, until they realized who it was they were looking at. 

All Might stood alone, breathing heavily, his suit in tatters, bruises scattered across his body.

His smaller, skinny, true body…

“Ah, there he is! Look at you! Isn’t it so relieving when a secret can finally be let loose. Hold on, here we go…” All For One’s Rivet Stab shot up into the sky, grabbing onto the bottom of the helicopter and dragging it down until it hovered in front of All Might, the camera aligned perfectly to him. “Let’s give them a good angle!”

  
  
  
  
  

***…~AMP~...***

  
  

*“No…”* Izuku whispered to himself, his heart pounding in his chest as he watched his hero’s true form revealed on national television. He felt Kyouka squeeze his hand, dread filling the air around them. 

He knew everything would change after tonight, but this wasn’t what he was expecting. 

He dared a glance at Katsuki, finding utter disbelief on his face. Kacchan was arguably just as big an All Might fan as him, even if he didn’t wear it on his sleeve like Izuku. He never had to. Ever since they were kids, All Might was everything to him. He’s what inspired them, even if Katsuki took the message a little differently. 

He just hoped Katsuki, and the rest of the world, would take this news the same way he did when he found out; That this didn’t mean All Might was weak in any way. In fact, still fighting for all these years in the condition he was in, just made him even stronger than he ever thought possible. 

“Wow, okay. I was *told* he was weaker, but even I wasn’t expecting that,” Tomura chuckled. “But, hey, if it’s any consolation, I still think my master looks *a lot* worse.”

“Shigaraki?” Kyouka asked, her eyes still glued to the screen.

“Yeah?”

“Shut the fuck up.”

“Wh-...Fair enough.”

  
  
  

***…~AMP~...***

**(** **Jirou Household** **)**

  
  

“...Honey?”

“Yeah, Kyou?” 

“...That’s Mr. Yagi.”

Mika nodded, just as dumbfounded as her husband with her eyes locked onto the screen, “...Yep.”

The couple slowly turned over to Inko on the other end of the couch, who was clearly just as lost as them, “...Izuku knows All Might? Like…personally?”

“I…don’t know. Doesn’t Kyouka? She interned.”

“Yeah, but, I-I mean this guy paid for her God-damn birthday party! *A private band worth tens of thousands!* Izuku also mentioned knowing ‘Mr. Yagi’ for a long time before we even knew him.” Everyone sat in silence, not sure what to make of everything they were learning. Kyoutoku’s brow furrowed, turning back to the two women, “Call it a parent’s sixth sense or whatever, but…Why do I get the feeling that they're not at the beach?”

  
  
  
  

***…~AMP~...***

  
  
  

**(** **Kamino Ward** )

  
  

“C’mon, All Might. Smile for the camera. It’s what you do best, right?”

Toshinori coughed again, spitting blood onto the ground. He looked up at All For One, a smile on his face, “You think this changes anything?”

“...Changes a lot, actuall-”

“I mean, you’ve seen me in a much, much worse condition, and I still beat you. What’s different?”

“Hmhmhm, while true, there is quite the difference. Remember what I told you? I wanted the whole world to see your face when I told you something very special…Hm? Ah, perfect! You’re both here!”

All For One moved his head to the side, barely dodging a yellow blur shooting past his head. Gran Torino flew past him, skidding to a stop next to his student. “You okay?”

Toshinori wiped blood from his chin, “What does it look like? I told you to wait for an opportunity.”

“Well it didn’t exactly look like you were doing so well on your own.”

“Hahaha! What a reunion!” All For One tossed the helicopter aside, letting it struggle its way back up into the sky, its occupants scared absolutely shitless. “After all those years chasing after me, I’d say you’ve earned the right to hear this news straight from me, old man.”

“You’re more than four times my age.”

“Anyway! I was just telling All Might here something you’ll find very, very interesting…”

  
  
  
  

***…~AMP~...***

  
  
  

*“Shit…”* Izuku mumbled as Torino showed up on screen. 

It was ironic with how much Gran Torino harped on them for not wanting them to go anywhere near All For One, and now it was him internally panicking about it. Katsuki was still completely enraptured with what was happening on screen, along with everyone else down below. By now, there were hundreds of people gathered under the jumbotron, watching tragedy unfold.

“Oh yeah, him. Ah, what was his name?” Tomura furrowed his brow at the screen, snapping his fingers as he tried to remember. “Turismo, or whatever. Where do I remember him from?”

“He was in Hosu,” Kyouka bit back. “He was helping clean up your mess.”

“Nah, nah, not that. Ah, right, he was in the old pictures back home. It’s kinda funny, isn’t it? How all this lined up.” Tomura smiled, a glint in his eyes as he played coy. You couldn’t really hear what was All For One or All Might were saying, the camera much too far away by that point. If his master could have some fun with secrets, why couldn’t he? Tomura used the hand not around Katsuki’s neck to cover the teen’s ear. Not that Katsuki would have heard them anyway, his focus was entirely on All Might. Tomura leaned closer to Izuku, smirk growing wider as he whispered, *“My grandmother, then her favorite little surrogate, and now you. That power of yours ties us together. Practically makes us family.”*

…

…

…

Three pauses. Three beats of Izuku’s pounding heart to process what he had just heard. He saw Kyouka turn towards Tomura in his peripheral vision, staring wide-eyed back and forth between him and her boyfriend. They both felt surge of sickness in their bodies that, somehow, they could only believe belonged to Nana. 

There was no way. 

Izuku slowly looked over to Tomura, unfortunately dignifying him with a response the villain was clearly relishing.

“...What did you just say?”

  
  
  
  

***…~AMP~...***

  
  
  
  

“Oh, I believe you heard me quite well, but perhaps the debris has gotten in your ears. Young Tomura is our dear friend Nana Shimura’s grandson.”

Whatever words Toshinori had on the tip of his tongue completely died, his mind going a thousand kilometers a second in every direction. “No…N-No, you’re lying!”

“To be fair, I haven’t lied since I got here,” All For One scoffed, laughing a little. “I mean, really? Who do you think you’re talking to? The question isn’t whether or not I would do it. It’s *why wouldn’t I?* Look, even Torino believes me!”

Toshinori looked over to Sorahiko, seeing an expression on the old man he hadn’t seen since he learned about Nana’s husband. He was staring blankly, looking as if he was going to vomit at any second. 

“Torino…Torino, I mean, c’mon! He’s just trying to get in our heads!”

“Why settle for just psychological torture when I can actually do the things that would torture you? Let’s all be honest here, Shimura’s plan was pretty stupid. She came right to me, why would I care about her child after that? But, when you actively try to hide him, then I’m interested. A whole lot of good foster care did for him, by the way.”

Well…there it was. 

They never spoke a word about Kotaro being sent into foster care. Izuku and Kyouka should be the only other two souls on Earth that know about it. He knew. He *always* knew. 

“No…”

“Yes, yes, yes. Her grandson. Her very own flesh and blood; all that’s left of it, that is,” All For One chuckled to himself, smiling down at Toshinori’s look of disbelief. “Perhaps I’m a sucker for dramatic irony, but when I saw the opportunity I just had to take it. But, don’t worry, he and I lived quite peacefully. Trained him, taught him…”

All Might’s heart dropped, memories of his confrontation with All For One years ago, “The cabin…the room in the cabin…The dust…”

“Ah, yes. Shimura’s lineage was right there, and you just missed him. Oh, and to answer your question from back then: Little Kotaro is long since dead, I’m afraid.”

From a smack to the face, to a bullet through the heart. A wave of instantaneous grief slammed into both men, leaving Toshinori frozen to the spot, and Torino stumbling back. He leaned against the remnants of a destroyed car, hand on his knee as his mind was flooded with images of the little boy that would play with Toshinori in Nana’s backyard.

“Y-...You *bastard!”* Toshinori seethed through grit teeth, tears springing in his eyes. “I-... *I’ll kill you!!!”*

“I’m flattered, but don’t look at me for this one. I didn’t kill him. But, he was gone, and young Tomura needed someone to look after him. You should be relieved he found a new home; a place where he would be taken very good care of. The best part is I didn’t even have to condition him to hate you! He came prepackaged with his loathing of you! That’s what I call some luck. But, I suppose I should be a little sympathetic. I mean, I lost my brother too. And, learning your would-be nephew wants to kill you all in the same day? Mm, so sad.”

“Nana’s family…” Toshinori slumped forward, feeling like a panic attack was coming on. “... *My family.”*

“Aw, where’s that smile All Might?” All For One raised his hands out to the sky, more helicopters arriving on site. “C’mon, show the world that everything’s gonna be okay?”

He didn’t know what to do, it didn’t feel like he was in his own body anymore. He just screamed. 

He screamed in pain, in agony, in grief, in fear. He had lost so many times before this battle even started, and he had no way of knowing. 

He was broken, and the whole world was watching. 

  
  
  
  
  

***…~AMP~...***

  
  
  

“Stop ignoring us! Who are you really?!” Izuku pressed Tomura, fists clenched as he continued the verbal deadlock he was in.

“I just told you! If you think I’m lying, to be fair, I haven’t lied since I got here! If you want more, then I can’t help you. Where’s the mystery in that? Besides…” Tomura patted Katsuki’s arm, “Don’t want Sparky to hear things you don’t want him too, right?”

“Would you three morons shut up for ten seconds?” Katsuki finally spoke up, his eyes locked onto the screen across the street.

Following Katsuki’s gaze, Tomura sighed happily as he watched the Symbol of Peace crumble before their very eyes on the big screen. “I see he’s taking the news well, too. Be pissed at me all you want, but this really does put a smile on my face.” 

The couple turned back towards the jumbotron, seeing All Might just…stand there.

In all the time he had known All Might, he had never seen him look so fallen; Torino, too. He couldn’t be giving up, that wasn’t possible. Izuku had seen that man fight without a stomach with his own eyes. But, this time, it was like his soul was sapped out of his body. 

*~“What’s he doing?”~*

Kyouka’s jacks perked up, her gaze falling to the street below. 

*~”Mom, what’s wrong with All Might?”~*

*~”There’s no way he’s giving up? I mean…I guess with how he looks now…”~*

*~Is that even All Might? There’s no way.”~*

*~”He’s not gonna lose, right?”~*

*“He can’t lose.”~*

Hundreds and hundreds of whispers and murmurs onslaught her ears, all with the same fears and worries about their hero in a fight for his life. If she knew All Might— And at this point she damn well better—she knew that nothing kept him down, not for long.

He just needed a boost.

“COME ON, ALL MIGHT!!! Kyouka screamed at the top of her lungs, with many in the crowd below turning around, trying to look up high to try and see who was shouting from the rooftop. “GET UP!!! BEAT HIM!!!”

Izuku took her hand, trying to pull her away from the ledge out of fear of Tomura not liking their position being revealed. “What are you doing?!”

Instead of going with Izuku, she yanked him forward. “Using my musician blood for good. Help me amp up the crowd. GET UP, ALL MIGHT!!!

*~”Y-...Yeah! Yeah, come on, All Might!”~*

*~”Beat him! Get back up!”~*

*~”You got this, All Might! You always come out on top!~”*

Izuku watched as one-by-one the crowd below began to join in. The shouts grew louder and louder as everyone from right below them to all the way down the street cheered. It was almost overwhelming how loud it was becoming, Kyouka had even stuffed her jacks into her jean pockets. 

He looked back at the screen, seeing All Might look up and around. He could hear them…

Looking over to Tomura, he watched his eyes roll. But, then his gaze met Katsuki’s, both silent in contrast to the thundering voices bouncing off of building walls. 

Izuku turned back to screen, stepping forward next to Kyouka, “WIN!!!”

“BEAT HIM!!!” Katsuki shouted, earning another groan from Tomura.

“COME ON, ALL MIGHT!!!” / “COME ON, ALL MIGHT!!!” / “COME ON, ALL MIGHT!!!” 

  
  
  
  
  

***…~AMP~...***

  
  
  
  
  

Toshinori raised his head as he heard his name echoed across the sky. Thousands of voices booming through the city, all cheering him on. 

All For One sighed as he watched a wide smile return on Toshinori’s face, “Here we go…”

“It’s just like I told you…It changes nothing. Try to kill me, drag me through the mud, it doesn’t matter. It’s my responsibility to protect this world from the likes of you. As long as there’s hope, I cannot and will not lose!”

“Ah, well, entertaining as always. After all this time you’re still just a little boy trying to play hero. Toshinori Yagi, the abandoned boy, unwanted by his parents and even unwanted by himself. A rejection of his name, turning it into something bigger than himself in a pitiful attempt at reaching for eternity.” All For One chuckled, wheezes escaping his lips in a fit of amusement. 

Toshinori sneered in hatred at the villain, trying to dismiss how utterly exposed he felt not in his hero state anymore.

"Yo-...You bastard…"

 “Yes, yes, I know you, fool. I know the fragility of your spirit, the desperate clawing to become more than just the purposefully orphaned child. Everything you’ve built of yourself, now broken down to the last shard of this glass house you’ve made,” All For One raised a hand towards the news-helicopter in the sky, “for all of the world to see. Now the world sees you broken mentally, spiritually, and physically, they will break as well. Their chanting is their own struggle, desperate to not give up on you, as they know you’re all that stands between them and I. Their hope will be shattered, including *your* last hope. Izuku Midoriya, was it? Yes. The rise, the prosperity, and finally the legacy of All Might will be nothing but a blood trail left behind by my boots. Then, and only then, will you die.”

The battlefield was still, the only noise coming from random falling debris and the rotor blades of the helicopter above. 

*“Keep his…”* All Might muttered, doing his best to stay on his feet.

All For One smirked at the weariness of his opponent, “Hm? I didn’t quite catch that.”

All Might looked up, wiping the blood from his chin, his gaze growing steely. 

“Keep…his name…out of your *God-damn mouth!”* Gold energy crackled around Toshinori, his fists clenching as he widened his stance. “You’ll never destroy me! Kill me now, and even in death I’ll follow you until your bitter end! Because, what I’ve done can’t be stripped away! Hope can’t be killed! I’ve seen those who’ve faced some of the worst life had to offer them, and hope still lives in their hearts! I will *not* break either! I refuse! I swear this to you, as All Might!” Toshinori growled out in pain, his body bulking back up as steam flowed from his skin. **“And, as Toshinori Yagi! The Symbol of Justice!”**

As cheering crowds roared in the distance, All For One sighed, seeing that his efforts would be taking a little longer, “Just justice?”

Toshinori cracked his knuckles, **“Right now, I’m not looking for peace.”**

His embers had never burned brighter.

“Hahaha! I must admit, your tenacity has always been as admirable as it is irritating. Alright then. Let’s finish th-...” All For One stopped, feeling something wrap around his body. He looked down to see himself in the clutches of a giant hand. He turned his head, finding Mt. Lady making a sudden appearance from around the corner of a building. How a woman of such size managed to sneak up on them, he'd never know. “...Huh. If you’d excuse me, I’m in the middle of somethi-!”

***\*CRASH!!!\****

With zero hesitation, Mt. Lady spiking All For One into the ground, the streets shaking from the impact. Toshinori brought his arm up to cover his face as dust and debris flew at him. 

Mt. Lady rounded the corner, looking down at All Might, “You good?”

**“Mt. Lady, you need to get out of here! Everyone else needs to handle evacuation and Search and Rescue! He’s too strong for you!”**

“Ah, c’mon, together we ca-!” From the crater she had created with All For One’s body came a shot of his Air Cannon, slamming directly into Mt. Lady’s face. Windows shattered as her head flung back, she stumbled before catching herself on a building. But, she blinked a few times, a dazed look on her face. Her skin began to instantly bruise, blood dripping down her face. She touched her chin, seeing the puddles of red on her fingers. “...Oh.”

Her eyes rolled back into her head, and she crumpled backwards. 

Toshinori sped down the street, rushing under the falling body of the heroine. Her arms slammed into the buildings as she fell, glass falling onto the streets below. People were still trying to evacuate, stubborn ones trying to grab things from their car. All Might made it to about Mt. Lady’s shoulder before he turned back, stopping her descent to the best of his ability. He held her up just long enough for anyone still nearby to run away.

With a grunt, All Might rushed out from underneath Mt. Lady, trying to set her down to the best of his ability. Which really wasn’t that much, but what could you do with a woman a thousand times your size? But, thankfully, she began to shrink as her unconscious body couldn’t maintain her form. 

“Ugh, people all day today.” Toshinori looked back down the street as All For One rose into the air, brushing off his suit. He groaned as a piece of his breathing mask dangled off of the side, broken tubes hissing with oxygen. He tore the chunk off, letting it fall to the ground. “Can’t people see we’re busy? You have rude friends, All Might.”

Toshinori ignored him, noticing something interesting. He smiled, chuckling to himself. **“...You’re dying.”**

“...Excuse you?”

**“That quirk—Ah, what was it called?— Oh, Impure Beam? The one you used on me. You took my stomach with that quirk, but you’re not using it. Last time it burnt half of your body into nothing. Your scars, the breathing mask, all that equipment back in your factory, having a successor in the first place. Hell, I haven’t seen you heal** ***once*** **throughout this entire fight…I did kill you, at least mostly. Your regeneration is working overtime just to keep you upright.”**

“Mm, maybe so. But, it seems we’re both holding on to fragile ghosts of our former selves. Whatever little flames of One For All that are left in you will perish, no matter how hard you desperately try and hold on to your strength. Let’s see which one of us gives out first.”

*~”It won’t be us.”~*

Toshinori froze, his eyes shifting around as he looked for the source of the sudden voice. **“The hell? Ur-?!”**

All Might lept back as All For One Ignitioned right to his position, his fist piercing the road and cracking the pavement like glass. “Distracted, are we?”

In a flash, All For One was on him again, a punch thrown right into his face. But, Toshinori rolled with the punch, shifting his body with the hit. His backhand-punched All For One, sending them both careening in opposite directions. The entire city center was practically a concrete wasteland at this point, but that was just fine with both of them. Plenty of room to do whatever they needed to do. 

All Might rushed him down, striking his fist into All For One’s stomach and using his momentum to slam him into one of the only remaining buildings. His fist still in the villain’s abdomen, he drove All For One up the wall and over his head, driving him into the ground. He brought his hands together, slamming down on All For One’s chest. The shockwave shot through the streets, the concrete giving way underneath them. 

All Might fell down the hole he sent All For One into. He hit the ground, his shoulder and calves hitting something metal. He quickly got up, but realized he was in almost complete darkness. The only light was a long string of dim red light. From what he could make out, they were in the subway.

Wait, another light? 

*~”Behind us!”~*

Toshinori spun around just in time to see All For One’s Rivet Stab emerge from the darkness, five tendrils shooting out towards him. He dodged two, broke another one, but the remaining two stabbed into his shoulder, driving him into the wall. 

All For One appeared from the dark, punching Toshinori’s head into the concrete. He grabbed All Might’s foot, throwing him up and slamming him down. 

“What was it, ten years ago? Eleven? You stopped an out of control train by slowing it to a stop with nothing but your strength.” 

Toshinori spat out a small chunk of concrete, “Didn’t know you were a fan.”

All For One grabbed onto Toshinori’s head, raising him up and facing him towards the light, “Let’s see if you can do it again.”

Toshinori squinted at the bright lights emerging from the darkness, his heart dropping as he realized why that light was getting bigger. 

He was about to be up close and personal with the JR trainline…

Why were the trains still running during a citywide crisis?!

He threw his elbow back, trying to strike All For One to escape, but All For One had used Hypertrophy on his arm to be just out of reach. His grip was iron-locked, with Toshinori feeling the pressure on his skull. The rumble of the train grew stronger and stronger, along with Toshinori’s heartbeat.

His feet were off the ground as All For One levitated. He couldn’t kick forward without destroying the train. In his struggle, he felt the embers of One For All course through his body, honing in on the flow and direction of power. He had to stop this! He felt his body begin to shrink back into his usual self, his body.

The train horn blared loudly, the brakes screeching as it grew closer and closer, but it was coming in far too hot. Collision was inevitable. 

*~”Up, Toshi!”~*

*‘What?! I…Who is this?! You…You sound li-’*

*~”There’s no time! Don’t think! Just trust me! Feel your power, push it up towards the sky! As hard as you can, just DO IT!!!”~*

Toshinori felt his embers explode, flowing through his body like never before. He tried to do as he was told by the mystery voice, even though he had no actual idea what he was doing. He pushed the power inside up, but all it did was make him feel lightheaded. 

He thrashed against All For One, trying to do something. *Anything.*

He *would not* let this happen!

“Come on…Come on…COME ON!!!”

***\*FWOOOM\****

  
  
  
  
  
  

***…~AMP~...***

  
  

“Wow, you guys proud of yourself?”  
  

Kyouka turned back to Tomura, doing her best (and failing) to ignore the powerful chanting of the city, “I thought you were rooting for All Might too?”

“I’m not rooting for All Might, I’m rooting against my master.”

“Wh-? I’m not even gonna dignify arguing semantics on that.”

“Look, just let me celebrate my promotion in pea-...” Tomura cut himself off, his eyes darting towards the sky, “Uh…”

“What? Finally out of bullshit to spout?”

Izuku was staring up too, mouth agape, “Uh…Kyouka?”

“Don’t have another evil business deal to offer us?”

Izuku reached back, not taking his eyes off of what he was witnessing, tapping Kyouka’s shoulder, “Kyouka, turn around.”

“What, Izuku? I-...” She turned back, finding Izuku’s eyes fixated on the stars above. Not only that, but the once thunderous cheers for All Might had gone completely silent as the rest of the crowd tried to process what they just saw. She followed Izuku’s gaze, finally at a loss for words herself once she found what she was supposed to see. “...Oh.”

A streak of dust curved high above the city, nearing the clouds above. Following the curve, far away, above the cityscape, almost like a blue star in the night sky…

…was All Might.

Not going up. Not falling down.

He was…

*Floating.*

  
  
  
  

***…~AMP~...***

  
  

**(** **The Sky** **)**

  
  

“Huh…Well that’s…new…” Toshinori looked down, struggling to keep a steady position in the air. 

Thousands of city lights below, the decimated mini-wasteland that was the old factory and city center, the top of hundreds of buildings and skyscrapers. Perhaps it was because he was floating above the world, the wind in his ear, he couldn’t hear the chants of his name anymore. 

Even with the smoke towering into the heavens, it was truly beautiful. Tranquility few could experience, here among the clouds.

…But what the actual flying fuck was happening?

*“Whew! Ho-Holy shit! I’m not gonna lie to you, kiddo, I had absolutely no idea that would work. I actually had nothing, I wouldn’t even call that a gamble. More like a random guess.”*

Okay, there was no denying it anymore. Either he was absolutely insane, which was a legitimate option, or…

“...Nana?”

His vision darkened, a swirl of near-translucent flames appearing before him. A very faint Nana appeared, her body barely formed from flame and fog. *“Hey, kid.”*

“...You’re not the Nana in Young Midoriya’s mind, are you?”

*“Hmhmhm, nah.”* Nana raised her hand up, chuckling at her transparent form. *“I’m a shard of what was to come. A ghost of a ghost. Whatever Nana that talks to Midoriya is the fully formed version that was created as One For All grew stronger with him. Sorry, kiddo. It looks like you just barely missed me. If you kept One For All for just a little longer, we could’ve talked, just you and me.”*

“Yep. That’s a good summation of my luck. But, even like this…” He reached out, awkwardly moving forward in the air until he was directly in front of her. Toshinori put his arms around her. He didn't feel anything, a grim reminder that she wasn’t really there. But, it was enough. “I miss you.”

Nana smiled, putting her arms around his shoulders, *“I miss you too…You know, if the cameras are looking at us right now, you look pretty damn weird.”*

“Don’t care.”

*“Hmhm, fair enough.”*

“Now would you please explain to me *HOW I’M FLYING?!”*

*“...I dunno.”* Nana shrugged.

“...What?!”

*“I don’t know! I just started fully existing fifteen minutes ago! Midoriya is the expert on all this new One For All junk! I exist, I feel something change, you’re about to hit a train, bing-bang-boom and now you’re floating!”*

“That’s no-! I-...Young Midoriya *certainly* never mentioned using your quirk, or *any* quirk of a past user! How is this ev-?! I…One For All is bullshit.”

*“Preaching to the choir, kiddo.”*

“Whatever! I’ll figure this out later. Are you with me for my final ride?”

*“I never left, Toshi. And what kind of horseshit is that? Accepting death? Who the hell do you think you are? We’re gonna kick his ass!”*

Toshinori backed out of the hug, looking around the clouds, “Where is he anyway?”

*“Well, we went up pretty damn fast, and he certainly wasn’t expecting that. I think you flung him up pretty high. He should be coming back down right about…”*

A bright light shone through the clouds, a roaring echoing in the air. All For One burst through the clouds, his Ignition blazing behind him. He stopped in the air, the shockwave of his sudden halt moving the clouds ahead. 

“What the hell happ-?” All For One coughed, wiping blood from his chin as he sensed All Might floating in the air. He did a double-take, finally, after all these years, completely speechless. “For fuck’s sake. Okay, I know this is rich coming from me, but your powers are bullshit.”

“Yeah, I know,” Toshinori sighed, looking over to Nana. *‘Speaking of which, how the Hell do I use this thing?’*

Nana floated behind him, mimicking his pose, *“Imagine there’s a joystick in your chest for direction, and a lever to move up and down. You’ve got my memories and experience stored in here…I think. Maybe that’s just a Midoriya thing, I don’t know. Just follow my lead, and you do all the punching!”*

“...Who are you talking to?”

All Might looked back to All For One, brow raised, “What?”

“Telepathy,” All For One tapped his temple. “You’re speaking to someone. C’mon, there’s no secrets between us…Well, you have no secrets, cause I know them all. That is, all except for how exactly you’re flying right now. Would you mind telling an old friend?”

“You know what?” Toshinori smiled, steam flowing, his body expanding. This was definitely his last go with this form, there was no way he could do this for much longer. **“Come find out.”**

**\*BAM!!!\***

All Might was on him in an instant, his fist slamming into All For One’s jaw. The clouds flew away from the shockwave, the full moon shining above. All For One shot his Air Cannon as he was smacked away, but All Might swerved out of the way, curving under the blast and continuing his pursuit. 

All For One growled, stopping himself in with Air Walk, his Ignition bursting to life behind him. The titans collided, their collision causing thunder across the skies. “Impact Recoil!” 

All Might’s whole body flinched back, blood spurting from his arm up to his shoulder blade. He was shot back across the cityscape, but before he got too far, a black swirl of sludge appeared behind him. 

He flew right through the portal, with All For One’s fist greeting him on the other side, black lightning searing against his skin. All Might yelped in pain, kicking hard against All For One’s stomach, sending them both flying away from each other. 

All Might growled, flipping around and launching back towards his enemy, the snap of the breaking sound barrier behind him. He struck All For One, sending him above the clouds, his spear-like bones shattering on impact. 

He curved around, sending a wide kick right into All For One’s side. He followed after him, a smile on his face, **“I’m getting the hang of this Float thi— Shit.”**

Another black portal opened up in front of him, and he definitely didn’t know how to stop. Actually, thinking about it, he didn’t even know how to turn this quirk off. He entered the portal, Air Cannon blasting him right in the face. He was sent back, entering *another* portal that opened up on the other side of All For One, Spear-like Bones coming right for him.

“Gah!” Toshinori cried out in pain as the tip of the spears just barely pierced his old wound, steam billowing as his body began to shrink back down. 

Toshinori grabbed All For One’s wrist, keeping the spears at bay, his own punch grabbed by the villain. 

“Impact Recoil!” All For One smiled as Toshinori’s arm finally cracked, Ignition firing behind him. They flew across the sky at blinding speeds, stuck in their stalemate. “You know what? I’m happy you unlocked this new ability! So much more fun. It reminds me of when I killed Shimura!”

All Might still smiled, blood flowing through his teeth, “What a coincidence! Use that telepathy, take a peek into my mind! I have a nice surprise for you!”

All For One’s mutilated brow furrowed, his mouth agape as a faint Nana flickered into his mind, mimicking her successor’s position. “...What the he-?”

*“Ha-Hey, Testicle Face! Been a few years, huh? Not looking so good these days, are you?”*

“H-...How?!—”

With All For One distracted, Toshinori snapped the villain’s wrist. He grabbed All For One’s face, shoving him down and redirecting their flight path. They slammed back down into the remains of the Nomu factory, the ground quaking from the crash-landing. 

  
  
  
  

***…~AMP~...***

  
  

**(** **Back at City Center** **)**

  
  

The rest of the Raid crew began to arrive on scene, the remaining SWAT team back at the League bar loading up the defeated Nomu into trucks. 

As the first responders and police began to join the Search and Rescue, Edgeshot flew over to Gran Torino, reforming his body back to normal. “Okay, we’re here. What did we miss?”

Torino didn’t even answer. He merely pointed up down the street, up towards the sky. An explosion sounded off in the distance, a plume of dust rose into the air as All For One was punched into the air, a speeding and soaring All Might chasing after him. 

Their clashes rang out, clouds dispersing with each hit as they battled across the heavens.

Edgeshot slumped his shoulders, mouth agape under his mask, “I…I don-...I don’t even…”

“What the Hell?!” Endeavor stomped up next to them, eyes wide as watched the battle rage on in the skies. “That form…and he-...He’s flying?! Explain, old man!”

Gran Torino barely even registered Endeavor’s command, but he was in no mood for this. The news of Kotaro was still echoing in his ears. “...Shut the fuck up and watch.”

  
  
  
  

***…~AMP~...***

  
  
  

Toshinori flew backwards through the dark clouds, a dozen Rivet Stab tendrils chasing after him. He buffed up his arms, clapping his hands. The shockwave shattered the tendrils, but All For One just sent more in his chase.

*“You can’t keep this up, Toshi!”*

All Might growled as he held his bleeding side, his broken arm that he just used not feeling much better. “I know! I just need an opening. Even if I go down with him, but he’s *gotta* go down!”

*“Nuh-uh! No way! You need to get back to those kids!”*

“She’s right, All Might!” Toshinori’s eyes widened as a black portal appeared behind him, All For One Ignitioning out the other side. They slammed into each other, with All For One winning out in the clash. “At least Shimura got you through UA! You’ll die before that boy even has bearings on what he’s doing! But, for old time’s sake, I’ll make it quick for him! You, however…”

More tendrils shot out, which All Might either managed to dodge or destroy as he rose further into the air. But, one stabbed right into his shoulder before All Might was able to chop it off.

All Might grunted as he pushed himself as fast as he could into the air, going straight up above the clouds. “I’ve already failed that boy more times than I care to admit! From this moment forward, I’ll *never* let him down again! I!!! REFUSE!!! TO DIE!!!”

The sound barrier broke again as All Might rocketed higher and higher up, the city becoming smaller and smaller below them. He dodged tendrils and black portals as he rose. All he had to do was make it as high as he could.

Then, he could end this.

“Refuse to let him down? Is that what a hero would say while running away?” All For One laughed, adding more Multipliers to his Ignition, catching up to All Might. 

*“Uh, he’s got a point, kiddo! I’m assuming you’ve got a plan?”*

*‘You’re the one in my head, so you tell me!’*

*“Toshi, I taught you! Most of our plans just kinda involve punching!”*

“I know, just trust me! I’m not running! How’s that Ignition doing All For One? If I remember correctly from our first fight, over-exerting yourself with it didn’t end so well!” With one final push, and a deep breath, All Might finally rose above the lower stratosphere. He curved to the right, turning back in the air to see All For One slow down, Ignition beginning to smoke and sputter out of his back. All For One still shot tendrils after him, but All Might kept going, dodging and weaving through the air. He wouldn’t be able to breath up there for long either, but All For One? He knew who he would bet on lasting longer. “Also, how’s that broken breathing mask doing?

All For One wheezed, the air too thin and dry for his damaged lungs. “Of course. I’ll admit, not bad! Far craftier than your typical meathead brain could come up with! That Midoriya has had quite the influence on you! But, it won’t be enoug-!”

***\*SMASH!!!\****

All Might slammed right past him, his fist crushing into jaw at sonic speeds. “What was that? I can’t hear you! Why don’t you fly over to me and say it again?”

All For One growled, trying to use Ignition again, but it was completely spent. His back was charred at this point, and his preoccupied regeneration would take *hours* to heal that skin back; maybe even days. Air Walk certainly wasn’t fast enough.

…He was a sitting duck.

***\*SMASH!!!\****

Again, he was stuck at speeds too fast for him to compensate anymore. 

***\*SMASH!!!\****

***\*SMASH!!!\****

***\*SMASH!!!\****

***\*SMASH!!!\****

***\*SMASH!!!\****

***\*SMASH!!!***

***\*SMASH!!!\****

***\*SMASH!!!\****

Every hit, All Might buffed up an arm or a leg, practically playing ping-pong with All For One. He smashed Rivet Stabs, dodged portals, weaved through black lightning.

…All with that damned smile on his face.

… *Their* faces.

“URAAAH!!!” All For One shot out Rivet Stabs all around, a spider web of tendrils firing out everywhere. Black and red formed like cracked glass across the sky. There were far too many, All Might couldn’t dodge in time. One sliced across his chest, sending him spiraling out of control. He managed to stop, but not before a bright light began to fill his vision. Flashbacks from six years ago filled his mind. “Like an annoying little mosquito! Still so weak!”

Cracks of white light burst across All For One’s arm, the clouds below dispersing at the building energy. He couldn’t risk adding his Multipliers to the quirk this time, at least not as many without risk of completely destroying half of his body. But, in All Might’s weakened state, it would be more than enough.

Toshinori still kept smiling, launching towards All For One, digging deep for the embers of One For All. He could feel his power envelop his body, he felt like he was in his twenties again! 

Nana smiled brightly, *“Give him everything you’ve got, Toshinori!!!”*

*“IMPURE BEAM!!!”*

As if a solar flare straight from the sun occurred on the Earth’s surface, everything was consumed in light and destruction. All For One felt his skin melt away, the flesh on his arm burning and tearing away as an opening in the clouds below gave way.

All For One wheezed as the Impure Beam began to die down, his arm falling to his side. At least he actually still had it, unlike last time. All For One gasped as he sensed All Might was no longer there. All that was left was a small, barely visible trail of golden lightning trailing up towards him…

…and behind him.

 …Not again.

All For One turned around, the moon and stars above, the silhouette of All Might before him. Fist raised, piercing blue eyes shining in the shadows, the light reflecting off the Earth shining on him from below. Perhaps it was his enhanced senses, but even from this high up, he could hear the chants of All Might’s name ringing out from below. 

The whole world was behind him.

Perhaps that’s why he lost before?

…And, why he lost once again.

He could feel the power emanating off of Toshinori in the air, his own bones, even in the hero’s near fatal state. He could not dodge. He could not counter. It was too late.

“Goodbye, All For One!!!”

For the second time in a century, All For One felt fear.

                                                                                                                 ![](https://i.postimg.cc/mrG1xWCw/USOS.jpg)

*“UNITED!!!”*

Toshinori’s fist slammed into the disfigured lump All For One called a head, his bones crunching into what felt like powder underneath the tremendous pressure. They fired down back towards the Earth, Japan returning into full view. 

Like a meteor entering Earth’s atmosphere, they plummeted back down towards Kamino with Toshinori doing his very best to aim for the abandoned factory ruins, hoping the evacuation got everyone out. Although, it was a bit late to worry about that.

*“STATES OF!!!”*

All For One’s world was going dark, his limbs entirely limp as he was at the mercy of his nemesis. Of course, he always had to credit All Might. If he was to die, Toshinori truly knew how to make it glorious.

*“SMAAAASH!!!”*

They impacted with the ground, the entire industrial and shopping districts blowing away into dust in an instant. The ground quaked, tremors shook the city as streets connected to ground zero cracked and split open for miles. A tornado of unseen size erupted into the air, tearing away buildings and top halves of skyscrapers, eroding any and all solid concrete into dust.

The tornado fell away, the remaining winds crashing into the city. The dark clouds had ripped open, and the dawning sun began to rise over the horizon.

Toshinori coughed as the dust finally cleared, blood dripping from his mouth onto All For One’s bloody and destroyed face. Was he alive? He panted as he put his fingers on the villain’s neck, groaning as he felt a very weak, but ever present pulse. “Ugh, of course.”

He may have felt young again, but his strength certainly wasn’t the same. If he had his old strength, he was pretty sure there wouldn’t be a body after that. Well, at the very least All For One’s arm had ripped off in the descent. 

*“You know what’s funny?”* Nana chuckled, *“I think you actually made him look a little better.”*

“Hmhmhm! You know, I think I did.”

“Toshinori!” All Might looked up, seeing Gran Torino bounce through barren ruins, dodging falling debris from the tornado. Above him, the news helicopter followed. He raised his hand up, stopping Torino from coming any closer. 

He needed to be alone for this. 

The helicopter finally arrived on scene, the spotlight finding All Might in the crater. They were waiting…

*“C’mon, kiddo. You know what to do. Here, lemme look at ya.”* Nana cupped his cheek, raising his head up to lock eyes with her. *“...You ready?”*

*‘...Yeah. Yeah, I think so. Thirty years…all that time…I…I did it, right? My…My dream? Do you think I did enough? Maybe I could’ve done mor-’*

*“Are you freaking kidding me? You did your best, Toshinori. More than your best. And, you still have more to do. Just not as All Might.”*

*‘...Yeah…Yeah, you’re right. The kids, Shigaraki, everyth-’*

*“I know. They’ll be ready, you’ll make sure of it. You’re gonna do just fine. Now, c’mon…it’s time.”*

The world waited with baited breath, the rest of the heroes appearing on site behind Torino. For the first time tonight, the entire city was completely silent. Toshinori stood tall, his body screaming at him to stop, but he had no choice.

He raised his fist in the air, returning his body to its heroic state. 

The cheers roared across the city, hitting his ears even from so far away. The news reporter was saying something, but Toshinori couldn’t hear him. He hoped Young Midoriya and Young Jirou could see him. He hoped David and Melissa were watching. He hoped Ms. Aiya from the foster home was watching, wherever she was. He hoped Kaina was allowed to watch. He hoped Yori and Kotaro, wherever they were up there, could see.

Just this last time.

*~“ALL MIGHT!!! ALL MIGHT!!! ALL MIGHT!!! ALL MIGHT!!! ALL MIGHT!!! ALL MIGHT!!!”~*

*It’s like I told you. You’re going to hear the entire world chant your name.”* Toshinori felt faint arms curl around his shoulders, a warmth against his cheek as Nana hugged him. That warmth began to fade, no matter how desperately Toshinori didn’t want it to. *“...I love ya, Toshi.”*

And, like that, she was gone.

*‘...Goodbye, One For All.’*

“And we have our winner! Welp, that’s that! Catch!” Tomura suddenly shoved Katsuki towards Izuku, but at an angle, making Katsuki trip right over the building's ledge. The couple quickly grabbed him, with Izuku grabbing the back of the straight-jacket and Kyouka’s jacks coiling around his waist. Once they pulled him back up, Izuku turned back to look at Tomura, One For All flaring as he launched himself at the villain.

Only for Tomura to fall through a black portal underneath him. 

“AH!” Izuku flew over him, stumbling to regain his footing once he landed. He turned back, finding Tomura far away on the other side of the building, standing on the ledge.

“C’mon, you wouldn’t hurt your kinda-cousin, right? I kept my end of the bargain, a deal’s a deal. Congrats on the mutual promotion, by the way. This was very enlightening, I hope for all of us.” Tomura took his hand from off his belt loop, placing it back on his face. “...Be seein’ ya.”

He fell backwards off the edge, with Izuku rushing after him again. But, once he made it to the ledge, all he saw over the building was the remnants of a disappearing black portal, vanishing from sight. 

Izuku glared down at where the portal once was, sighing deeply before turning around. They got Katsuki back, and All Might was alive. That was all that mattered.

…For now.

Katsuki growled as he threw the straight-jacket off of him after Kyouka vibrated the locks off, screaming as he burned it to cinders. “Fucking piece of shit!!!” 

“Enough,” Kyouka sighed, waving the smoke away from her face. “Let’s just get you back to the police station and forget this ever happened.”

Katsuki turned around, glaring at both of them, “What the Hell was *any* of this? What did he want with you two? What was all that shit he said about cousins, and fucking promotions, an-”

“Bakugou,” Kyouka cut him off, her own tired glare matching his. “Shut. Up. You’re gonna go to the police station, and not say a word. This was nothing, happenstance. You escaped on your own during the commotion. After what I learned about you tonight, being on thin ice was over a long time ago. Now, as far as I’m concerned, you’re drowning. Shut your mouth, and walk down the fire escape. Say another word, and I’m gonna fucking punch you.”

“You can’t ju-”

*\*KRACK\**

Katsuki stumbled to the side as Kyouka’s fist slammed into his jaw. Izuku grabbed her arm, gently pushing her back, “Kyouka…”

Kyouka continued to glare at Katuski, her anger at him from before had finally boiled over. She relaxed, signaling Izuku to let her go. She turned away from Katsuki, returning her eyes back to the jumbotron. She just wanted to focus on the positives again. “...I told him, and he deserves that and more.”

“I don’t care. Now really isn’t the time, *either of you.”* Izuku looked back at Katsuki, who surprisingly didn’t look like he was going to fight back. He didn’t even look angry as he wiped his busted lip. He couldn’t help but wonder just how much of One For All went into that punch she gave him. He had the same expression he did back at Aldera; a damn near unreadable lack of emotion. But, there was something behind his eyes. Izuku wasn’t holding out hope that it was any form of shame. “Kacchan, please, forget everything you might’ve heard tonight. Just forget it, and we won’t say anything about what was said at the school. It’s not blackmail, you know me. It’s just a request that we go back to whatever our situation was before.”

“...” Katsuki remained quiet, apparently taking Kyouka’s threats to heart. It also probably didn’t help that if he even looked at Kyouka a little wrong, he knew Izuku wouldn’t stand for that. He turned back to the jumbotron too, which Izuku took as a silent agreement. 

Izuku ran his hand down his face, the night finally catching up to him. He was so God-damn tired. They just couldn’t catch a break. He had no idea what Tomura was gonna do with all this information about him, but…

Nana’s grandson?

*‘...Nana? You there?’*

*“...”*

*‘...Nan-’*

*“Not now, kid. Jus…Just not now.”*

Izuku sighed as he felt her fade away into his subconscious entirely. Her voice was wobbly, she was clearly crying her eyes out. 

Great. What next?

*~“Now…”~*

Izuku perked up at All Might’s voice booming over the jumbotron. He turned around, seeing All Might on screen pointing right at the camera. 

*~“Now…it’s your turn.”~*

…Oh.

The crowds cheered on, taking it as a message to any more villains out there, but Izuku couldn’t hear it. He stepped forward, standing between Kyouka and Katsuki. All three were silent. Kyouka knew, but Katsuki must’ve picked up on this not being a normal message to the world. If the blonde only knew how right he was.

It was a message to him.

It was one of those moments where you knew it would happen. You knew that, at some point in your life, certain moments were going to happen that you had to live through.

Illnesses, puberty, heartbreak in some shape or form, the death of pets, grandparents, parents.

Inevitability was the master of amnesia. You don’t think about these things until they’re at your doorstep. Nobody is ever ready for when they arrive.

Izuku knew his relationship to All Might was a strange one. For years, he was his idol, his inspiration. In a lot of ways, he’s been family since before they ever even met. His ideals, values, so many pieces of what made him the person he was, all because of Toshinori Yagi. 

Just some quirkless kid…

He bore the world on his back for decades, and now he just couldn’t do it anymore. 

Now, it was his turn.

Even with All For One defeated, this wasn’t over. Not by a long shot. Dark days were ahead of them, and Izuku was given the torch to light the way, even when nobody knew it. 

It was something he never really thought about too hard. All Might always called him his successor, but it was just a title for the longest time. Now, it wasn’t just real, it was *here.*  

The Symbol of Peace. 

The World's First and Last Defense. 

The Almighty Man. 

This wasn’t grief he was feeling, at least not for the death of someone. Maybe the death of life as he knew it. But, most of all it was acceptance, whether he actually wanted it or not. 

Time was up. It was up to him now. All Might gave up everything for the world, time and time again. He gave up everything for *him.* He had to do the same.

Izuku brought his head down, trying his damndest to fight back tears, but he failed miserably. He suddenly felt Kyouka’s hand on his, intertwining their fingers and squeezing tightly. It was almost funny, actually. For a brief moment, he forgot he wasn’t alone in this anymore.

Kyouka’s gaze met his, the sparkle of tears welling up in her own eyes. 

She knew that if she was in pain about this, Izuku was dying. She had always known All Might, who didn’t? He was an inspiration to everyone, including her. But, since she began to know and understand him personally, she found so much more. 

Behind Izuku, he was up there as one of most incredible human beings she was lucky enough to know. In such a short amount of time, he was family. But, now, it was more than that.

Even if Toshinori didn’t know it yet, he was speaking to her too. 

These powers, this responsibility…it fell to her now as well.

Even after talking with Nana in the vestige space, and all the bad ear and headaches One For All had caused her in only a few days time, it didn’t particularly feel real. Her mind never fully registered the magnitude of power she now had at her beck and call, much less what brought along with it. 

The Symbol of Peace. 

The World's First and Last Defense. 

The Almighty Woman. 

She begged and pleaded with the universe to give her power, to give her the ability to fight alongside the one she loved when the end times came. And, somehow, she was granted a miracle. She got it. 

And, now, she had to own up to it. 

This power wasn’t just hers. It wasn’t just Izuku’s. It was one for all.

… *They* were one for all. 

The couple held each other close, watching as the sun rose higher over the cityscape. Tomura was right. It was the end of an era. All Might had led them there, to this moment. 

He led the whole world to this moment.

Now, it was their turn.
