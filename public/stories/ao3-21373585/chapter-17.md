"...Am I going to have to spoon-feed you?"

Izuku looked over from his untouched food, a wobbly smile adorning his features. "At this point, you might."

Under the table, Kyouka took his hand in her's. "You'll be fine. It's not like they can kill you."

"That's not comforting."

Across from them, Ochako bounced in her seat. "You've beaten Todoroki in every event, Midoriya. I'm sure you'll do great. And if it makes you feel any better, I'm nervous, too."

"A-A fight is far different from a race and cavalry battle, but thanks."

Tenya smiled, too. "Maybe you and I will be up against each other, Midoriya."

Kyouka shook her head, "Are you trying to give him a heart attack?"

*"Everyone!"* Present Mic came in over the intercom. *"Please be back on the field in the next ten minutes where we will be showing the full roster for the final event: The Tournament!"* 

Izuku sighed, “No, but that might give me one.” They all stood up, throwing away any leftover food they had and heading back outside. Izuku suddenly felt something slip into hand, finding a small bread roll there. 

Kyouka placed a hand on his shoulder as they walked, “At least eat this. Now calm down, everything’s gonna be fine. You’ve done more than enough to prove yourself. The message has been sent.”

Izuku smiled in appreciation, his nerves somewhat eased. But, he knew deep down that if he lost now without facing Katsuki head on, he wouldn’t be satisfied. Nothing would change. He needed to know what would happen in a real fight with him.

And that didn’t even include whatever he would have to do if he fought Todoroki. 

The only thing Izuku had to calm his mind, or at least switch his focus on the fight from fear to analyzation, was that Izuku now firmly believed Katsuki was scared Izuku might actually win. Desperation oozed from Katsuki even if no one else could see it, but Izuku knew. Taking a bite from his roll, they stepped back out onto the field and gathered around with the rest of the students in front of the large screen. 

Midnight stepped up onto the stage, speaking loudly to the students “It’s time for the tournament portion of the festival! The remaining sixteen students will be placed in one-on-one fights. Who you face will be decided by drawing lots. After the placements are set, we’ll take another half hour to engage in some festivities if you choose to do so. I’m sure those participating in the tournament would rather save their strength. Now, we’ll start with Jirou’s team as they placed first in the last event. Please, step up an-”

“Excuse me.” All eyes turned to see Ojiro with his hand raised, his gaze down in disappointment. “...I’d like to drop out.” Murmurs and whispers immediately began spreading around, everyone confused by Ojiro’s decision. “I...I honestly don’t remember a single thing from the entire cavalry battle. I don’t even remember accepting to be on the team I was on.”

Kyouka squinted her eyes at that, turning her gaze towards Shinso who wasn’t even acting interested in what was going on. Izuku followed her line of sight, whispering, *“Isn’t that the guy from the hallway when we got here?”*

*“Yeah. He talked to me when I went to go find you in the bathroom, too.”*

*“Do you have any gaps in memory?”*

Kyouka shook her head, *“No, not at all. The conversation was pretty short. Nothing that important. He just told me which direction you went. Keep an eye on him, I’ll keep my ears open.”*

*“...You’ve been waiting to use that phrase for a long time, haven’t you?”*

A smirk grew on Kyouka’s face, *“Perhaps.”*

Ojiro continued, sadness still etched into his features. “I know it’s probably a stupid idea to throw away this opportunity, but...everyone else got here with their own strengh, and I don’t even know how I got here. I don’t feel like I’ve earned it, so I forfeit my position in the tournament to someone else.”

Another hand raised up, this time by Nirengeki Shoda of Class 1-B. “I don’t remember anything either. And being able to advance without feeling like you did anything kind of defeats the purpose, so...I’ll also give my position to someone more deserving of it.”

The whispers started up again until Nemuri cracked her whip, gaining their attention once more. The hero hummed in thought, her gaze looking back and forth between both forfeiting students. “Such a naive and green choice...I LIKE IT!!!”

Kyouka pinched the bridge of her nose, throwing a hand up in exasperation. “That’s it. I’m done trying to understand this place.”

After deciding who would be replacing both students and drawing the lots, the large screen then lit up with all of the first match ups. Izuku noticed he was up against Shinso, his curiosity peaking. He was going up against the wildcard, the one with the unknown quirk. At least, it was unknown to most of the participants. 

“Oh come on!” Denki shouted, gazing up at the match ups. “If I win I have to go up against Midoriya! He’s basically immune to everything I do! Hacks! I call hacks! And then...” Terror then suddenly formed on his expression as he remembered he wasn’t exactly on Izuku’s friends list for understandable reasons. “...I’m dead.”

Izuku stepped back a bit, hiding behind Kyouka to avoid his possible opponent’s gaze.  Izuku also felt it best to not mention that he had absolutely zero idea how he stopped Kaminari’s attack in the Cavalry Battle. He realized at some point he should talk to Kaminari, let him know his anger wasn’t fully on him and more on his short, grape-headed friend.

...Once he figured out how to properly socialize with the classmates outside of his friend group. Hell, he still had to learn how to properly socialize with anyone other than Kyouka. Looking further up his list, Todoroki could possibly be his third match. However, Katsuki was all the way on the exact opposite end of the bracket. 

He turned his gaze towards the crowd, his eyes meeting the blonde’s. Katsuki allowed himself a grin, this was exactly what he wanted. 

The only way they would be able to battle was in the final round. 

All eyes on them. His victory over Izuku would come with the ultimate validation. Izuku would be his inferior, and everyone would see it.

“Oh...my...God.” Izuku turned to see Kyouka’s eyes wide, her body frozen. 

Confused, Izuku asked, “What’s wrong? Are you really scared to fight Uraraka?”

“No. I’m scared of who I fight if I win.”

Izuku looked at the match up next to Kyouka’s, his eyes landing on...Oh.

If Kyouka won, she’d be up against Todoroki.

Izuku didn’t mean to downplay or insult Sero, but...it was fairly obvious who was going to win. Todoroki was going to advance to the next round. And now, it was no longer Izuku’s turn to panic. 

Kyouka grasped Izuku’s arms, looking him dead in the eyes. “I. Am going. To die.”

“I-I’m sure it won’t be that bad.”

“Being frozen, losing in two seconds flat. Yeah, that’s pretty bad. Not to mention Uraraka has been all “Terminator Mode” since this whole thing was announced. So either I lose with a good fight in the first round, or I win my first fight and lose instantly in the second. How exactly do I win here?”

“Jirou!” Before Izuku could answer, Ochako called out Kyouka’s name. “You and me are against each other. What are the odds?”

“I’d say one in sixteen, but I think the universe was going to send me a message either way.”

“What?”

“Nothing. Can’t wait,” Kyouka responded with a tired smile. 

Off to the side, Katsuki looked up at the screen with confusion. “Who the fuck is Yaoyorozu?” 

The ponytailed girl perked up, her mouth opening to say something. But, she stopped herself, looking down at her feet and backing up a bit as to not garner any attention. 

“Midoriya.” The teen turned around to see Ojiro approaching him. “I need to talk to you.”

*‘Can people please stop needing to talk to me today?’* He nodded his head, “S-Sure.” Looking towards Kyouka with a look that screamed “Help”, she waved at her other friends and began to follow them. 

Ojiro raised a brow, “Oh, Jirou. I didn’t know you were coming.”

“Yeah, kind of a mutualism symbiotic relationship Izuku and I have.”

Rubbing the back of his head, Izuku nodded in agreement. “Y-Yeah, I-I uh...I’m not very good at-”

Ojiro waved them off, “Nah, I get it. You’ve always been quiet, at least as long as I’ve known you. Nothing to worry about. Besides, maybe you’ll both benefit from this.” Breathing a sigh of relief that Ojiro was understanding, the duo continued to follow him into the stadium until they found themselves back in the Class 1-A waiting room. “Now, I need to warn you about Shinso.”

**(Midoriya Family Apartment)**

*“I mean...Wow. You said he had a quirk now, but this...this is nuts.”*

Inko chuckled, moving her phone to her other hand as she sat back down on the couch. “I know, I couldn’t believe it when he told me.”

*“You don’t think...You don’t think he’s had this for a long time and just didn’t say anything? I mean, he wasn’t exactly too keen on talking to us after his diagnosis.”*

Inko sighed, “I...I don’t know. I won’t lie and say the thought hasn’t passed my mind. It would make sense for him to keep it secret after...after what I told him that night. Maybe he manifested the quirk soon after, and then wanted to prove me wrong. It doesn’t sound like Izuku at all, but at this point I just don’t know.”

*“I can hear that tone in your voice. Stop beating yourself up over that night. You had to deal with that situation alone...Maybe, if I had been there…”*

“Hisashi, you do everything you can to keep us with all the money we need and more.”

*“I know that, but...he hasn’t responded to my letters in four years. And each one became shorter and shorter, and they weren’t even that long to begin with.”*

“I’ve been telling you for ages to just call him.”

*“I don’t know what to say. And, at this point I’m not sure he wants to talk to me. I haven’t seen him in person in years. Far too many I care to count.”*

“I’ve been right next to him the entire time, and yet I feel like I’m just as far away.” Both parents sat in silence for a little bit, mulling over the past and trying to figure out how to correct their mistakes.

*“You know what? Nevermind that for now. This is supposed to be exciting. Our son is in the finals of the UA Sports Festival! And, from what I’ve been seeing on camera, has a lovely little lady by his side. Kyouka Jirou, was it? When were you going to tell me about this?”*

“I was waiting for when Izuku finally told *me* .”

*“...Oh.”*

“All I know is that she’s the best thing to happen to Izuku.”

*“Well, I hope I can meet her someday.”*

Inko nodded, resting her head on her hand. “You and me both.”

…..

**(Sports Festival Stadium)**

After their talk with Ojiro, the couple made their way to the exit hallway. Izuku’s match was going to start in five minutes. Cementoss had just finished creating the ring they would be fighting on. Kyouka put a hand on Izuku’s arm, “You ready?”

“I think so. He’s still a wildcard, even with the warning from Ojiro. S-Someone like that is bound to have a trick up his sleeve.”

“Let’s just hope he’s a one trick pony. I have to get back to my seat. Good luck, Fern.” 

“Oh, that’s a new one.”

“I’m struggling here, you’re gonna have to help me with more names.” They chuckled, leaning in and capturing each other’s lips.

“Ah, Young Midori-Oh! Whoops!” The teens detached their lips, switching their gaze to the just appearing Toshinori. “Ah, don’t mind me you two. I’ll just uh, I’ll leave you to it.” 

Kyouka raised a brow, looking the tall, gangly blonde man up and down. “Izuku, you know this guy? He was about to say your name.”

Toshinori froze, his cover thought to be blown. Who else but All Might called anybody “Young (Insert Name Here)”? However, Izuku quickly recovered. “Th-This is my mentor I told you about. Toshinori Yagi.” 

“Oh, really?”

Hearing his cue, Toshinori played along. Besides, it wasn’t exactly a lie. “Ah, yes, that’s me. You must be Youn-...I mean, you must be Jirou. I mean, I already knew that from the festival. Great job, by the way. Midoriya has told me a lot about yo-.” 

“You’re the one I have to blame for that torturous training regiment.”

“O-Oh, well you know what they say. No pain, no gain.”

“I can’t gain anything if I’m dead.”

“Haha, I heard you have the bark to match your bite, and this is proof along with being able to handle the training at all. Anyway, Young Midoriya, your quirk control has improved significantly. You’ve been doing incredible out there. Why didn’t you tell me?”

Izuku shrugged, a small smile on his face. “G-Got distracted, I guess.”

The blonde nodded his head towards Kyouka, “Yeah, I saw.”

They both blushed, looking away from the adult. Izuku continued, “I still don’t really have a set range yet. All I can do is base it off of how much pain I’m in. And even the amount I’ve been using the most stings.”

“Hm...Well, I’d say it’s definitely more than five percent. Maybe seven or eight? Pain is a decent base, but giving a number helps with visualization. And that visualization makes it easier to set a specific amount.”

Kyouka raised her hands up, stopping the conversation. “Woah, hold up. You’re telling me Izuku does all that stuff, and he’s not even using *ten* percent of his power?”

All Might nodded, “Just about, yeah.”

Kyouka turned to her boyfriend, a stunned expression on her face. “What the hell are you?”

“...An anxious teenager trying his best?”

“...That checks out.”

The speakers suddenly blasted to life, Present Mic yelling out in excitement. **“Alright, everybody! It’s time for the tournament to begin! Fighters, make your way to the ring.”** 

Izuku rolled his shoulders back, turning towards the exit. “Alright, here we go.” With one last kiss on the cheek from Kyouka, Izuku made his way out to the ring.

**“For our first match we have a surprise MVP of this year's tournament, Izuku Midoriya of Class 1-A! However, his violet partner in crime isn’t here. So let’s see what he’s capable of on his own!”** Izuku stepped up onto the ring, his gaze meeting Shinso’s. **“And on the other side we have Hitoshi Shinso, who’s mostly been under the radar for the festival. But, now that he’s here, he’s got the spotlight on him! Fighters! Get ready!”**

Midnight stood on her cement platform, also made by Cementoss. “The rules are simple. Knock your opponent out of the ring, make them unable to continue, or have them say, “I give up!”, and you win.”

Cementoss added, “Remember, anything except going for the kill is allowed. Otherwise, we’ll stop and disqualify you. Ethics have no meaning here, fight dirty if you have to.”

“Huh..” Shinso scoffed, “I give up? Just like that tailed moron, huh?” Izuku furrowed his brow, but didn’t give a verbal response.

Present Mic came back over the speakers, **“Alright, let’s get this show on the road. 3! 2! 1! BEGIN!!!”** The crowd cheered, ready for action. But, neither contestant moved, both standing in place. Shinso because he didn't plan on actually fighting, and Izuku because he was waiting. Ojiro warned him about Shinso, but Izuku still had no idea what he was capable of. The threat level hadn’t been assessed yet. **“Uh...You guys do know this is the part where you fight, right? Wait, is my mic on?”**

Aizawa groaned, **“Believe me, it’s on. My ears won’t stop ringing.”**

Smirking, Shinso began to talk. “He’s an idiot, right?”

*‘Don’t talk.’* Izuku merely gave a lifted brow in response to show he was listening. 

“I’m talking about that stupid monkey who gave up his shot to be here.” Izuku’s eye twitched just a little. Hurling insults like that clearly wasn’t Izuku’s favorite thing in the world, but he kept himself under control. It was far from enough to make him talk. 

If responding was the only way Shinso was a threat, then it should be fine to attack, right? Izuku didn’t have enough information to feel completely comfortable with that decision, but he couldn’t just stand there all day. Izuku bent his knees, energy beginning to flare up around him.

On the other side of the ring, Shinso gave a low, irritated growl. Izuku was going for the immediate win. There was no time to waste, he had to pull out the trump card.

“So, Jirou was that girl’s name, right?” Izuku faltered for a second, waiting to hear exactly what Shinso was going to say. “You know what’s funny? At first, I thought you could do much better than *that.* But, then I got a good look at you. You two are made for each other.”

*‘...Shut up.’*

“That is if you had the balls to ask out a girl like that. I mean, you have eyes, right?”

‘ *Shut. Up.’*

Up in the seats, Ochako nudged Kyouka. “What are they saying down there?...Kyouka?”  
  

Kyouka sat frozen in her chair, her skin deathly pale. “N-...Nothing. Nothing really.” She felt like she was going to vomit, her entire body began to feel uncomfortable. No shift in position could change it. Her arms folded over her stomach, trying to focus on the fight and not think about what was being said.

Lightning was bursting around Izuku at an alarming rate, his glare turning deadly and unblinking as his eyes were set on Shinso. The indigo haired teen began to become a bit worried. He was gambling here. He didn’t even know if those two were in a relationship to begin with, he just got lucky with that assumption. 

Two things could happen if he continued. Either Izuku didn’t speak and punched him so hard he would be eating through a straw for the rest of his life, or Izuku finally snaps and yells, securing the victory for Shinso. *‘Well, you know what they say. High risk...’* Standing tall once more, Shinso shook his head. “Or maybe you didn’t get with her for her looks, and instead for what she was willing to do, if you get what I me-”

“SHUT YOUR GOD-DAMN MOUTH!!!” Izuku then froze on the spot, his eyes glazing over and muscles going numb.

Shinso smiled, *‘...High reward.’* 

Up in the stands, Ojiro groaned, “Damn it.”

His worry fading, the indigo-haired teen pointed behind Izuku. "Now walk out of the ring." Against his will, Izuku turned around and began to walk to the edge. 

*‘No! Damn it! I’m such an idiot!’* 

Shinso breathed a sigh of relief, “You know, you almost had me scared for a second. But, then I’m always reminded how easy people like you think a victory like this will be for you.”

Present Mic came in over the speakers, **“What the heck is going on down there?! Is Midoriya giving up?!”**

“It must be nice,” Shinso continued. “Having everything handed to you from birth.”

Kyouka growled up in the stands, hearing every word. *‘You have no idea how wrong you are, jackass.’*

Izuku was using all the willpower he had to resist, but nothing changed. He was still heading straight for the edge. *‘Even after I was warned...I-I-...Kyouka, All Might...I’m sorry.’* His body wouldn’t listen, his mind was becoming fuzzier by the second. What made it worse were all the eyes watching him.

Not the crowd of heroes, but the eyes of Kyouka, All Might, Ochako, Tenya, people who actually believed in him for once in his life.

Even Kyoutoku and Mika were surely cheering him on from home. He was failing them, too.

And Katsuki and Todoroki, the two people he swore he wouldn’t lose to, were watching go out so pathetically. 

He had no control.

He was *useless* once more.

“Izuku!” Kyouka yelled out from the 1-A seats. “Fight it!”

*‘...Kyouka.’*

His mind flashbacked to the playground, he and Kyouka sitting next to the scorch marks of his past.

*“Then...Then, you have to prove them wrong. Prove yourself wrong. They thought you were weak, couldn’t do anything. They convinced you, too. They were dead wrong. And you can prove it.” Kyouka took Izuku’s face in both of her hands, looking him in the eyes. “The Sports Festival. Make it a message.”*

*“To those bullies?”*

*“No. To yourself. Prove to yourself you’re not useless.” Izuku’s eyes widened, remembering what All Might had told him a few days back. His mentor wanted him to use the Sports Festival to send a message to the world. But, now Kyouka wanted him to make it a personal message. Something to open his eyes, to break past the barriers put on his own mind.* 

 *“I...I will...I’ll do my best. We both will.”*

 *Kyouka smiled, brushing her nose against his. “I really like that word now. Both .”*

Izuku fought with every ounce of will he had left. Everyone he loved was counting on him. All the people that have helped him, blessed him with a better life, were counting on him winning. 

He wouldn’t lose.

He *couldn’t* lose.

*‘C’mon! Fight it! Stop moving! I! Can’t! Lose here! After everything, I won’t! Something! Anything! STOP ME!’*

Izuku felt his stomach drop, his vision darkening and tunneling into the entry archway into the stadium. The pitch black darkness, eight sets of eyes lit up. He didn’t recognize any of the silhouettes except for one foggy one. 

*“Hehe…”* A female voice rang out. *“Whatever you say, kiddo.”*

The tunnel sparked to life, a burning fire of all colors shot out and slammed right into Izuku. He felt his body begin to come back into his control, power flowing through his veins. He stopped in his tracks, still staring straight forward. 

Shinso’s eyes widened, “Wh-? What the hell?”

Up in the stands, Uraraka looked on in confusion. “What’s happening? Why is Midoriya leaving the ring?”

Katsuki growled, “That fucking nerd better not be giving up so he doesn’t have to fight me.”

Kyouka swerved around in her seat, glaring up at Katsuki. “He’s not giving up! He would never-”

“Uh, guys?” Mina’s eyes widened, her hand raising to point down at the ring. “...Is anyone else seeing that?”

All eyes turned back towards Izuku, his body beginning to emit more energy than usual. This time with a mix of yellow electricity with his usual green. 

Kaminari hummed to himself, "Huh, looks like my electricity…" His eyes widened, remembering what had happened when he shocked Izuku during the Cavalry Battle. "Holy crap that's my electrici-!"

***\*THZOOM\****

Everyone in the stadium had to cover their eyes as a bright flash emanated from Izuku's body, every person's hair stood on end as a tingling wave passed through them. Everyone felt a push and a small shock, sparks flying from the ring. All of the screens, camera’s, phones, lights, everything of the sort shut down, the only light source being the sun. Due to his close proximity to the blast, Shinso tumbled back, his body shaking from electricity. 

He shakily stood up, looking over to Izuku to see him looking back at him. “How...How did yo-? You shouldn’t have control!” Izuku still didn’t move, his glare focused on Shinso from over the shoulder. “What?! Nothing to say for yourself?! Of course with power like that you’d escape. I couldn’t enter the golden gates of the hero course because of my quirk, but people like yo-”

***\*CRACK\****

All Shinso had seen in that moment was a flash of green light, and heard the sickening crunch of his nose and Izuku’s fist slammed directly into him. He flew back, landing and skidding to a halt just outside the exit archway.

Midnight raised her whip, lifting her megaphone up to speak. But, it was still shut down thanks to whatever Izuku had done with his blast. So she simply shouted, “Shinso is out of bounds! Midoriya advances to the next round! Now we’ll take a short break as we try to get the power back on!” Some of the crowd cheered while others sat in stunned silence. Izuku stood with his fist extended out, shock also clear on his face.

He didn’t mean to be that aggressive...Did he?  
  

Well, he was still fairly pissed off about Shino’s insults towards Kyouka. So, maybe just a little bit...unintentionally. 

Shinso sat up, groaning as he covered his broken nose, trying to the blood. “Damn it.” He looked up at Izuku, shaking his head before standing up and walking back into the stadium. Izuku grimaced, not liking how that had ended. He looked back at All Might who was still standing near the opposite entrance in shock, and then up at Kyouka in the stands before running off to follow Shinso.

Kyouka sighed, “Damn it, Izuku.” She quickly stood up and rushed out of the stands and towards the most logical place the two teens would go to.

…..

  
  

**(Recovery Girl’s Stadium Office)**

Izuku opened up the door to Recovery Girl’s office, finding Shinso already on the exam bed with Chiyo kissing his cheek. “There. Now rest here for a bit.” She turned around and looked at Izuku, “Please don’t tell me you broke your bones again.”

“N-No, not this time. I just came t-to check on him.”

“Worried for your opponent? Been a bit since we’ve seen that kind of sportsmanship in the festival. Alright, fine. So, are you with that Jirou girl, yet? I’d hope so after leaving you two in my office for so long at the entrance exam.”

“You did that on purpose?!”

“Of course I did. I saw that look on your face when she walked in. I couldn’t resist. Now I need to check on Aizawa’s bandages, no matter how much he’ll whine. Hopefully they’ll get the power back on by the time I get back.” Chiyo left the room, leaving the two boys to themselves.

They sat in silence, the only light source being a few candles Recovery Girl had lit due to the power outage. “...U-Uh.”

“Look, I didn’t mean those things about your girlfriend, alright? Really, she’s pretty, even I won’t deny that. I was just trying to make you angry so you would yell. Which worked...until it didn’t.”

Izuku breathed in deep, nodding his head. “I-I understand...Just don’t say anything like that again or I swear-”

“I get the gist of it. I already get the feeling that I got off easy with a broken nose and concussion. I may not like the position of life I’m on right now, but I want to stay alive. Just remember I didn’t mean any of it, seriously. You won’t see me again, anyways. I’ll be going back to general studies.”

“N-No, I…That wasn’t all.” Izuku cleared his throat, steeling himself to talk. “I wanted to know wh-why you want to be a hero.”

Shinso raised a brow, “What?”

“Why d-do you want to be a hero?”

“...Not all of us are born with the ability to become like those we naturally admire.”

“I know, bu-”

“No. You don’t know.”

“I know more than you ever could understand.”

Hitoshi looked confused once more, “What’s that supposed to mean?”

“I...I just do. I-I can’t go into why, but...I know what i-it’s like to fight so hard for something everyone else got so easily, only to fail in the end. I-I just wanted you to know that.” Izuku turned around and opened the door, only to be met by a large group of general study students. Piling in, they surrounded the injured teen.

“Shinso, that was awesome. You got so close!”

“MVP of General Studies!”

“A bunch of heroes are talking about you out there!”

Izuku watched Hitoshi’s eyes widen slightly as he listened to his classmates. Smiling a little, Izuku took his leave, closing the door behind him. “So…” Izuku turned his head over to find Kyouka leaning against the wall. “...you’re still a walking lightning bomb it seems. Although, this time it was a lot bigger.”

“Y-Yeah, I think it had to do with Kaminari’s electricity. When I absorbed it in the Cavalry Battle, I must’ve stored it somewhere and used it during the fight.” 

“How’d you escape the brainwashing anyway?”

“Well, it started when I heard your voice.”

Groaning, Kyouka threw her head back, “Ugh, that’s so corny.”

“It’s true, though!” Granted, Izuku was leaving out the extremely important detail of One For All saving him, but Kyouka couldn’t know that...yet. And apparently One For All could speak? So...that was a thing. He’d have to talk to All Might about it later.

Whatever it was, Izuku had a feeling it wouldn’t be the last time he’d be seeing those figures.

“S-Sorry, by the way. Even after Ojiro warned me, I still responded.”

“It’s fine, really.”

“No, it’s…” Izuku then suddenly grabbed Kyouka’s hand, dragging her down the hall.

“Whoa! Izuku, what the heck!?” He led her into an empty waiting room, likely intended for another class, and stood in front of her after closing the door behind them. “What are you doing?!”

“...You heard Shinso, didn’t you?”

“...Yeah. It must be crazy to find someone who at least somewhat understands what it’s like to not be accepted.”

“I’m not talking about that. You heard him during our fight. You heard why I yelled.”

Kyouka lowered her eyes, biting the inside of her cheek. “...Yeah, I did. I-I mean, whatever. You heard him in Recovery Girl’s office. He didn’t mean it. He was just trying to make you mad.”

“I-I know, but...with what happened during the battle test last month, and the beach…” His hands shakily moved up, caressing every centimeter of her face before stopping with one hand on each cheek. “...You’re perfect. Please, *please* don’t think otherwise. You’re the most gorgeous thing I’ve ever laid eyes on.”

Kyouka looked down at her feet, a blush on her face. But, eventually she bumped her forehead against Izuku’s affectionately. “I didn’t say stop.”

Izuku smiled, “Beautiful is too weak a word to describe you.”

“Keep ‘em coming.”

“I-I’m running out of cheesy phrases.”

“Then show me how you feel.”

Izuku paused at the forward request by Kyouka, and the massive blush on her face proved that she was surprised by how blunt she had been. “...I’d be m-more than happy to.” Both teens leaned in, their lips meeting passionately. It was becoming far easier to get carried away as intimacy was becoming more common for them. Which was evident as they moved back, Kyouka’s legs hitting the edge of one of the tables. She sat down on the table, not disconnecting her lips from Izuku’s.

Suddenly, the lights flickered on along with the speakers. **“Hey everybody! We’ve got the power back on! The next fight will now go on as scheduled.”**

Izuku looked back towards Kyouka, "Should we go watch the next fight?"

"Nah, it's Kaminari. He'll lose anyway. And if he wins, you'll just absorb whatever he throws at you."

"I-...I guess that's fair."

"Yep. Now c'mere." As their lips connected again, Kyouka couldn’t deny the seed of doubt and insecurity from Shinso’s words were still in her mind. Her subconscious was screaming at her that Shinso only complemented her to avoid another beating. Those thoughts were sure to come back to haunt her at another time.

But, for now, she had her ESI (Emergency Support Izuku) on standby. And her mind was far too focused on her upcoming match to concentrate on the topic for much longer. 

  
  

…..

**(15 Minutes Later)**

Iida turned around in his seat as he saw his friends approach and sit down. “Where have you two been?”

The couple looked at one another, both blushing slightly before simultaneously responding, “Bathroom.”

“...At the same time?”

Kyouka shrugged, “Best friend mental link. Now, what’d we miss? Kaminari lose?”

“Unfortunately yes.”

“Ha! Called it.” Looking down over the railing she found Sero and Todoroki getting ready to fight. She knew needed to follow Izuku’s examples and use the opportunity to examine Todoroki. If she beat Ochako, Todoroki was her next opponent. And that didn’t bode well at all. 

With any luck, Sero would be able to give a good enough fight to allow Kyouka a decent amount of time to analyze the situa-

\* ***SHNNK!\****

...Or Shoto could cover the entire side of the stadium with ice. Kyouka let out a shaky breath, “You’ve gotta be kidding me.”

Midnight deadpanned as she was half covered in ice. “Sero, are you able to move?”

The tape quirk user looked over at Midnight, “You’re kidding me, right? Do you really think I can move right now?”

“Then that settles it. Sero is unable to move. Todoroki moves on to the next round!” Shoto moved to defrost his classmate as the crowd tried to cheer up Sero for his attempt. 

Looking over at Izuku, Kyouka could see he was focusing on Todoroki. It was his analyzation face, a look she had seen plenty enough beforehand to recognize. “You picking up something?”

“Huh? Oh, uh, yeah. His ice affects him. Frost covers his body after he uses it. And if he refuses to use his fire that’ll only slow him down, make him weaker.”

“Noted, but still not much going for me.”

“I-I don’t know. I think this was a one time thing. The overkill of ice I mean. He seems out of it, at least compared to when I talked to him. Something’s happened since then, he seems...almost sad.”

“Well, hopefully he switches and becomes so happy that he just lets me win.”

Ochako suddenly spoke, “I hope the same.” The couple turned to their bubbly friend, a smile on her face. “What? I have a shot at going against him, too. I’m not just gonna let you win, Jirou.”

“Ah, but if the winner has to fight Todoroki, do we even want to win?”

“That’s...a fair point.”

**“Next two fighters, head to your waiting areas! The arena should be thawed out shortly.”**

The girl’s stood up, both looking at one another. “Ready?” Ochako asked.

“I sure hope so.” They chuckled, making their way to the exit. Kyouka and Izuku decided earlier that he wouldn’t follow her down to the waiting area to avoid suspicion. And, without telling him, for Izuku to get used to being around his classmates without her around.

Her fears about facing Shoto were still evident in her mind, but she still had a promise to keep. 

She would do her best like Izuku.

Besides, if she somehow performed a miracle and beat Todoroki, she would have to fight Izuku.

...Maybe losing really would be better.

**(5 Minutes Later)**

**“Alright folks, it looks like we have teammates up against each other for this round. MVP Kyouka Jirou of Class 1-A against the ever bubbly Ochako Uraraka also from 1-A!”**

Midnight cracked her whip, silencing the crowd. “You girls both know the rules, so we’ll begin immediately. Ready yourselves!”

Kyouka crouched down, her jacks brandished. Ochako did the same, her arms out, ready to charge. They knew it would happen eventually, but this was the first match of the tournament portion where not just two classmates, but two friends were up against each other. But, both were ready to do whatever it took.

**“BEGIN!”**

Just like Izuku’s prediction, Ochako charged forward at full speed with her hands out. Kyouka’s jacks shot out, her left one quickly jabbing Ochako’s leg fast enough to where the brunette didn’t have the opportunity to grab it. The gravity manipulator tumbled, allowing Kyouka to take the opportunity to charge forward herself. She maneuvered around and grabbed Ochako around the waist, who was in mid roll, and used her jacks and new physical strength to throw the brunette back at the other side of the ring.

Ochako rolled, but slid to her feet before making it over the edge. She charged once more, ready for Kyouka’s jacks this time. Kyouka knew that the same trick wouldn’t work twice, so she let Ochako come to her this time. Ochako stretched out her hand, aimed directly for Kyouka’s chest. Dodging to the left, Kyouka jack wrapped around her friend’s wrist.

With one hand caught by Kyouka’s jack, Uraraka tried to use her other hand. But, Kyouka grabbed it, using her free jack to jab Ochako in the stomach, causing her to jolt back. Kyouka pushed her back further with both hands this time. 

She knew it was a fight, but she didn’t want to straight up punch her friend in the face. So, instead of a fist fight, Kyouka began dodging and weaving through every attempt Ochako made to touch her. With every dodge Kyouka’s jacks would stun Ochako on one side of her body while Kyouka would give a forceful push, making the duo go closer and closer to the edge.

**“Would you look at that folks! Uraraka is unrelenting, but Jirou is giving her no chances! I can see why she’s this year’s MVP so far!”**

Ochako gave one last thrust forward, this time towards Kyouka’s face. The violette dodged inward, pulling Ochako forward and shoulder bashing her back. Once again, Ochako was right against the edge of the arena and breathing heavily.

But, she didn’t let it stop her. Ochako charged once more. Kyouka had to give it to her, she was determined. Readying her jacks for another counter attack, Kyouka was surprised to find a blue jacket thrown into her face.

“Ah! What th-?!”

“Gotcha!” Kyouka felt a hand press into her stomach, and then her feet lifted off of the ground. Removing the jacket from her face, Kyouka looked down as she began to drift away from the concrete arena. Ochako grabbed Kyouka’s leg, twisted around and threw Kyouka towards the edge of the ring. 

**“Uraraka has finally managed to land a hit on her opponent! This might be it for Jirou!”**

Kyouka spun in the air, her body almost over the grass. Ochako got her fingers ready to release Kyouka from her hold, sending her to the ground. Kyouka shot out her jacks at Ochako, the brunette jumping back to dodge.

Kyouka’s jack stabbed into the concrete, allowing her to yank them and send her back to the ring. While her feet may have been back on the ground, she was basically a sitting duck. She couldn’t unplug her jacks or she would fly off again. She could try and run with her jacks unplugging and plugging back into the ground again, but her body was still super light. Running would be awkward and still put her at a disadvantage. 

 Kyouka couldn’t help but feel bad as she looked up and saw panic in Ochako’s eyes. It looked like that was her only plan. Not that Kyouka blamed her. The setting they were in didn’t exactly benefit either of their quirks. Or, it wouldn’t have benefitted Kyouka’s if she hadn’t been training with Izuku.

Thanks to Izuku she had way more combat experience than Ochako did, it almost wasn’t fair. And her brunette friend was relentless, trying so hard to win. Kyouka thought back once again to Ochako's desire to help her parents, imagining her parents watching her at that moment. 

...Ochako needed this more than her.

There were other festivals. And Ochako needed that attention from pros as soon as possible. What if her family went bankrupt before she could get them the money? Kyouka had received enough attention anyway. First place in both the first and second events would garner her plenty of offers alone, she had enough.

She promised she would do her best with Izuku, but he would more than understand finding helping someone else being more important.

Kyouka detached her jack from the concrete, her feet slowly leaving the ground. Ochako kept her speed up, charging towards Kyouka to push her out.

...Until she stopped.

Kyouka's eyes widened, "What...What are you doing?"

"What are *you* doing? You stopped fighting."

"I-I-...I just…"

Ochako raised a brow, standing up straight. "Were you...going to let me win?"

Kyouka tried to speak, but nothing came out. She was caught red-handed. "...You need this win more than I do."

Ochako furrowed her brow in confusion, "What do you mean?"

"Your parents, the life you want to give them, you need the attention of other heroes to get that money as soon as you can. I'll have other chances."

Ochako furrowed her brow, processing what she was hearing. "...No."

"I want to win with both of us giving everything we have! You reminded me to achieve that dream I need to remember to always remain steady, do it all the right way. Make sure I don't accidentally fall off the right path. Well, that starts now! I want to win this the right way! I want to earn it! I can't have things handed to me, I have to fight for my dream! So, Jirou, I can't win. Not like this. Not if you're trying to just give it to me." She backtracked, getting back into a battle ready position further away. "So come at me with everything you've got!"

Kyouka didn't know Ochako had taken what she said a couple weeks ago to heart.

...But if this was what Ochako wanted, who was she to deny her that.

Kyouka got ready, too. Her brow furrowing in concentration, “Bring it.”

“Grah!” Ochako charged at full speed, this time with clenched fists instead of open hands. Kyouka jumped back, using her lack of gravity to her advantage. Giving her jacks some slack, she pulled on them and flew at Ochako with a drop kick. The brunette dodged under with a roll, now aiming for Kyouka’s jacks still stabbed into the ground. But, just as her hand reached out, one unplugged and jabbed Ochako directly into the palm of her hand. “Ow!”

Kyouka pulled again, flying back towards Ochako. The brunette was ready this time, grabbing Kyouka and throwing her towards the end once more. Kyouka growled as she began flying towards the edge again, releasing her jacks from the ground and instead wrapping them around Ochako’s leg instead and sweeping her feet out from under her. Pulling once more, using Ochako as her anchor, Kyouka landed back on the ground.

Ochako grabbed at the jack around her leg, pulling hard. Kyouka fell forward, landing in a push up position with her nose just inches from the ground. Her body began moving up again, so she vibrated the jack in Ochako’s hand, causing her opponent to release it. Kyouka retracted her jacks, plugging them back into the ground to keep her there. Just as she regained her footing, the musician looked up to see Ochako only a few meters away in another charge. 

Her instincts kicked in. Kyouka had learned how to react to Izuku’s fighting speed, so this was nothing.

She grabbed Ochako’s hands as they came to give another hard push, her jacks unplugging from the ground and giving a pulsing jab into the brunette’s abdomen. Kyouka threw them both back, placing her feet on Ochako’s stomach as they rolled backwards. Giving a hard kick, Uraraka went flying through the air and tumbling out of control. 

Ochako managed to stop herself, but just a little too late. She felt her stomach drop as she realized her leg was just barely hanging over the edge and touching the steps below. 

Midnight yelled out through her megaphone, “Ochako Uraraka is out of bounds! Kyouka Jirou advances to the next round!”

The crowd cheered, claps and whistles rang in Kyouka’s ears as she relaxed her body and began to float up. As she rose, she could make out the faces of her classmates easier. Kyouka looked up into the stands, Izuku was looking down at her with the brightest smile. 

Her eyes then shifted to the left, Todoroki not sitting far behind.

They made it to round two, but things had only just begun.
