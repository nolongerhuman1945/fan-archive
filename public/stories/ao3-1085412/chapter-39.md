**Book III: A Marauder's Plan (Advanced Pranks)**

**Part 7: Pronglet Returns to Hogwarts (The Don't Let the Tri-Wizard Tournament Spoil It Prank)**

*August 30* *th* *1994*

Albus sat down in the chintzy armchair he had conjured and smiled benevolently at the gathered Professors. He so loved the start of a new academic year, the buzz of excitement as the castle became alive again in preparation for the children arriving.

He gazed around the room and felt his lips twitch at the Odd Couple of Severus and Alastor sat in the same corner glowering out at the others. He had no idea what had spurred them to form a friendship of sorts (and he was absolutely certain neither man would say it was a friendship if asked) but he was pleased. Both men tended to keep themselves far too isolated, and if the small thought entered his mind that both had contrived the relationship on the principle that one kept friends close but enemies closer, he ignored it.

Minerva sat beside Albus. She had assured him that, apart from her pride, she had fully recovered from her injuries incurred at the World Cup. She had also informed him that she had accepted an offer from Sirius, Remus and Harry to move into their home during the holidays going forward. Her delight was evident and Albus would not spoil it with his concerns. *Their* relationship continued to be frosty although both had strived to ensure the impact on the school's operations was minimal. He hoped they would one day regain their former closeness, but he knew it would take more than a box of chocolates to smooth over the decisions he had made, and forced Minerva to make about Harry, without informing her of her own claim to the boy.

Filius was on Albus's left and chatting happily to the new Duelling Instructor, Tobias Hilliard – a bright twenty-eight year old with blond hair and startling blue eyes who was sure to be the recipient of many school girl crushes. Filius had embraced the changes to the school's curriculum and had helped Minerva with much of the administrative complications of the new electives.

Albus's eyes strayed to the other new elective teacher, Doctor Helen Jordan; she would take the Healing elective. He felt a warm glow of satisfaction at the result of his reaching out to Noshi Blackhawk for assistance in filling a Healer position within the school who would take over management responsibility for the school infirmary.

It had been Poppy's suggestion for improvement. She had pointed out that when she had first been hired Healer Gareth Baggins had been on staff, but when he'd left Baggins hadn't been replaced and some of the practices such as mandatory health checks for the students and the staff had fallen away due to lack of resources. While Poppy's mediwitch credentials were second to none, she admitted that she sometimes felt out of her depth and the Healers at St Mungo's weren't always readily available for a consult; that with her advancing years she was feeling the strain of always being on call. She was delighted with Helen's appointment and the two had become fast friends. Poppy had been extremely helpful to their new staff member who had embraced the opportunity to work abroad for a couple of years.

Pomona had also been extremely helpful after approaching Albus with her suggestion for improvement; mentoring Hagrid. She sat beside Hagrid talking quietly. She was ensuring that the animals he showcased in his classes were age appropriate and keeping an eye over Hagrid's enthusiasm (and already he suspected that they had dodged a safety issue over some breeding plans Hagrid had concocted – Pomona had immediately put paid to those). Hagrid himself had been delighted at Pomona's mentorship; keen to improve his teaching so he could convey more fully the wonders of the animals he loved so much.

Indeed, Albus mused with delight, his existing staff had all been wonderful in embracing improvements. Even Sybill who had arrived last in a whirlwind of brightly coloured scarves had agreed to the withdrawal of Divination as a standard elective, agreeing fervently with the view that it would allow her to spend quality time with those who had a real gift. The current sixth and seventh year would continue to NEWTs; the fifth and fourth years to OWLs but the current third years who had opted for Divination would have to undergo a test before being allowed to take the subject and if they failed to show a gift, they would have to take another elective.

The basic theoretical parts of Divination would be covered in a foundation class that all second year students would attend going forward. It was hoped that the potentially gifted would be identified through the class. Albus had secured a different teacher for the foundation year – the centaur Firenze. It was in his opinion quite a coup (although a bemusing one since it had been Firenze who had approached Albus and informed him that he had been instructed by the herd stallion to teach now the Raven had been found – and Albus resolved to think again on what that meant because no doubt it meant *something*). Sybill was happy because she felt the foundation class beneath her while Albus figured Firenze would be competing with Hilliard on the crushes front. Aurora Sinistra had warmly greeted the centaur and Albus was happy to see the usual stand-offish creature respond to the Astronomy Professor's overtures of friendship.

He let his eyes drift over the remaining staff members; Bathsheda Babbling, the Ancient Runes Professor, was engaged in a lively debate with the new Muggle Studies Professor, Alison Bunting, and the returning Flying Instructor, Rolanda Hooch. A second trio of woman sat together nearby but much more sedately, sipping tea and in quiet discussion; Irma Pince, the Librarian, Septima Vector, the Arithmancy Professor, and the new History of Magic Professor, Matilda Memoire. Matilda had come highly recommended from Beauxbatons. Her grandmotherly demeanour and story-telling approach was a complete contrast to Binns who had moved on rather than haunt Hogwarts.

The final staff member had taken up a position by the door and was glowering at everyone; Argus remained firmly miserable and Albus's remonstrations to him about his professional conduct and attitude with the students didn't seem to have made a dent. Albus sighed. He so hoped Argus would take his advice to heart because if he failed to change, Albus would have no other choice but to let him go.

He gave an internal sigh and pushed the matter out of his head to focus on the meeting. He raised his wand and was happy when the entire staff became instantly quiet.

"Thank you," Albus said warmly, "and welcome to all! This is our first full staff meeting of the year. In a change to previous years we will meet twice a term…"

"May I ask how often you met previously?" asked Matilda cutting in.

"Once at the beginning of the year and once at the end which clearly was not enough." Minerva supplied. "The new regime is part of a number of improvements we are making to the school this year."

"Indeed." Albus smiled gratefully at Minerva. "So, as I mentioned this meeting will take place twice a term. The agenda will be to ensure all staff are informed of school wide policy changes and initiatives, to have an open discussion about the school's progress through the year, and to provide a forum for you all to raise any concerns about the school or individual students."

He was pleased at the satisfied and hopeful looks on the majority of the staff.

"Excellent!" Albus said brightly. "So firstly, our changes. Minerva, perhaps you could give a brief overview of the academic changes."

She shot him a disgruntled glare but she briefly outlined the changes to the existing curriculum and the new electives.

"In addition, Albus and I will make random audits of your classes through the year." Minerva said as she finished.

Septima's elegant eyebrows shot up. "Random audits?"

"It is our intention to sit in on one of your classes." Albus replied, gesturing with one hand. "Nothing to be worried or concerned about. We will observe only and provide constructive feedback in private to the individual Professor afterwards. Nothing will be shared with your colleagues beyond that which you choose to share."

There were a lot of unsettled looks from the existing Professors but the new additions to the staff didn't seem perturbed.

"Any questions or shall we move to the next item?" Albus asked gently. They all shook their heads and Albus nodded at Minerva who swished her wand. Instantly, a parchment was delivered to each member of staff.

"This is a copy of the school guidelines for detentions and points." Minerva explained briskly. "I'd like to give my thanks to Filius for his work in updating the former copy. It details quite explicitly what behaviour or actions are worthy of setting a detention and what kind of detentions can be set," her eyes flickered to Hagrid and to Argus, "detentions that take place in the Forbidden Forest, for example, are disallowed. The guidelines also elucidate what behaviour or actions constitute taking of points and how many, and the opposite; what behaviour or actions constitute awarding of points and the suggested number of points to be awarded. I will be monitoring detentions and the points system daily and will reverse any decisions not in line with these guidelines. Filius will act as my check in this matter and will monitor my performance."

A stunned silence enveloped the staff room.

"You are not seriously suggesting we comply to the letter of this?" Severus raised his parchment with disgust.

"We are," Albus confirmed, "since it has been noted by our Board of Governors that our disciplinary policies have fallen into disrepair of late, and the staff's interpretation has not been equitable leading to some students being punished for behaviour while others are not, some rewarded for behaviour while others are not. I do expect all of you to comply and these are not new guidelines; as Minerva said, these are simply a revision of our existing guidelines."

"Well, as someone new to teaching I appreciate the guidance," Hilliard said cheerily, "this will come in very handy." He waved his parchment gaily and ignored Severus's sneer.

"A copy of these guidelines will be posted in each Common Room." Filius added. "The students will have full access and can appeal to their Head of House for any unfair detentions or points deductions as they could before. They will however run the risk of the punishment being doubled for any appeal that is found to be malicious or mischievous in nature."

"If there are no further questions?" asked Albus gently. He didn't wait for the nods before he smiled and swished his own wand. A second piece of parchment appeared. "This is our new Anti-Bullying Policy. I would thank Poppy for her input here."

Poppy beamed proudly.

"As per the discipline policy, all bullying behaviour is strictly prohibited from name calling to physical intimidation. Students may confide bullying in any member of staff with assurance of anonymity and any medical treatment will also be provided under the same assurance. All reports should be forwarded to Doctor Jordan who will lead a weekly review meeting with the Heads of Houses to determine the best way forward for the victim and the bully."

Albus personally thought it was overkill but Sirius's admonishments still rang in his ears.

"Further," Albus continued gravely, "any reports of staff bullying the students will be dealt with most harshly. You will receive one verbal warning on a first offence; a written warning for a second; and a third will lead to automatic dismissal. Any physical harm to a student will bypass the warning system and lead to an automatic dismissal – there are obviously caveats for classes where injury may occur in the course of teaching. If any of you has concerns, please discuss them with me."

"You should also note," Minerva added, "that the warning system will also be used with students who are bullying. A student causing deliberate physical harm to another, outside of the duelling club or a class where minimal injury may have been expected such as DADA, will automatically be expelled. The muggles, I believe, call this a no tolerance policy."

"Again, the Anti-Bullying policy will be posted in the Common Rooms and outside the Great Hall to ensure the students' awareness." Albus added.

"I would encourage the House Heads to explain in face to face meetings within the first week of school." Minerva jumped in. "This way none of the students can claim that they missed being informed. While there will be some leeway during the first week as older students adjust to the new policy, there will be none beyond it."

Filius nodded happily. "An excellent idea, Minerva."

"Excellent," parroted Severus but Albus knew the Head of Slytherin would keep his House informed. Severus might not like teaching but he took his duties as Head of House quite seriously.

"We have one last policy change to cover. If you would, please, Alastor." Albus nodded at his old friend who heaved a sigh and swished his wand, revealing a third parchment.

"New Security Policy." Alastor said succinctly. "We patched some weak points around the Forest and various passageways in and out of the castle. The wards have been updated to notify the Headmaster if an animagus is on the grounds in addition to Minnie."

"About time." Septima said briskly.

"Additional security wards have been added to the Infirmary Stores and the Potions Stores; these can only be accessed by identified staff members. An Automatic Recall ward has been set in the library for overdue books or books restricted to the library." Alastor continued gruffly. "The wards on the Broom Store and Quidditch Pitch are acceptable."

Rolanda looked vindicated while Irma smiled pleasantly at Alastor, pleased at the addition of the new ward.

"Students will not be allowed out of the castle between the hours of nine o'clock in the evening and seven o'clock in the morning. Curfew for first through third years is set to nine o'clock; curfew for fourth through fifth years is set to ten o'clock; sixth and seventh to eleven o'clock. Fifth year Prefects will perform bed checks at ten o'clock for the lower years. All missing students will be reported to the Head of House. Fourth through seventh years will not be given a bed time or a bed check as a privilege."

Albus's lips twitched at Alastor's disgusted expression and Minerva's satisfied one.

"Sixth and seventh year Prefects will patrol the main corridors and areas between eight and ten." Alastor said. "This should enable them to be within their Houses for curfew with plenty of time to spare. Additional Prefect duties will involve patrolling on the Hogwarts Express; monitoring their own year and one of the lower years at the House table during meals; providing assistance to any student during the Hogsmeade weekends outside of school grounds, and providing assistance to their Head of House as needed in administrative or tutoring duties. The Prefects' Bath remains a privilege and we have also established an inter-House Prefects Common Room near to the library. The Head Boy and Head Girl…"

"This year's Head Boy is Robert Ogden and the Head Girl is Natalie Warren." Minerva interrupted to announce. "Mister Ogden is a Hufflepuff and Miss Warren is a Ravenclaw."

"As I was saying," Alastor threw Minerva a chiding look, "they will have their own rooms and baths within their respective Houses as a privilege. They will also have a study just down from the Prefect Common Room. One of them will be expected to be present in that study between the hours of seven and eight in the evening to be available to students either for assistance in tutoring or to listen to student concerns. Their old duties remain including; assigning the Prefect rota and managing the Prefects; providing student feedback to the Deputy Headmistress; performing duties for the Deputy Headmistress as required; and, representing the school when needed. They've received copies of the disciplinary guidelines, the Anti-Bullying policy and this," he waved his parchment, "they are expected to brief the Prefects at a pre-journey meeting at ten-thirty before the Hogwarts Express leaves King's Cross."

"The Prefects have been notified of their earlier rendezvous time." Minerva jumped in.

Alastor's magical eye whirled in her direction. "Finally, staff have no curfew although one was suggested…"

Severus snorted.

"…final patrols will be between ten and eleven-thirty, and cover the usual areas."

A chorus of approval broke out at hearing that news. The old patrols had lasted until after midnight.

"While I will remain in charge of overall security, there will be a Day Watch Supervisor who will oversee breakfast and lunch, and will generally make themselves available to the Prefects if they require assistance through the day. There will also be a Night Watch Supervisor who will oversee the time from the beginning of dinner at six through to midnight. Rotas are at my discretion and all staff will participate unless they have a signed note from Albus excluding them. They will be the first point of contact for any emergencies during that time. It's expected that in-House emergencies during the night will be dealt with by the House Heads. New communication mirrors have been affixed within the Common Rooms and the living quarters of the House Heads to allow the Prefects to contact them in a timely way. However, two former colleagues of mine; Mary Hartley and Kenneth Day will be patrolling Hogwarts as night security staff from midnight until seven."

He grasped the parchment tighter and sighed.

"Hogsmeade weekends will continue every month during term time. Two staff will be responsible for providing a point of contact for students within Hogsmeade itself; the Day Watch Supervisor will remain behind in Hogwarts." Alastor cleared his throat. "We'll discuss staff presence during Yule and Easter another time, but otherwise the final thing to mention is the floo access. You've all got communication capability cleared for the floo in your quarters. I've shut down the Common Rooms but they can be overridden by the House Heads. However, the transportation facility is no longer under your control and it is locked down. If you wish to have a visitor, I will facilitate floo access."

"That's rather an invasion of privacy, isn't it?" Aurora complained. Albus noted that a number of the Professors looked unhappy with the new rule.

"We can't have unknown people wandering around the castle." Alastor said bluntly. "You may think you're inviting a friend to have a drink or a meal in your quarters but rumour has it there's an improved Polyjuice potion about and given the clear and present threat to Potter, we're monitoring who is allowed inside the wards."

"May I also remind you all that there is a professional code of conduct and guests should not be within the castle walls unless explicitly allowed by either myself or the Headmaster." Minerva said sternly. "With the exception of the House Heads who are expected to remain within the castle at all times, you do have the option of leaving if you are not on patrol or assigned as the Night Watch Supervisor."

"Outward unrestricted floo access will only be allowed from my office floo, Minerva's, and Albus's. Inward travel to mine and Albus's for the most part." Alastor confirmed. "The infirmary is restricted to travel between it and St Mungo's only."

"If you're thinking of leaving the castle on foot and flooing from Hogsmeade," Albus said seeing unhappy faces, "you may, of course, choose that option. But you will still need to leave word with Minerva to ensure that if an emergency does happen, someone knows of your whereabouts."

"And to check your identity on your return." Alastor commented.

"That's fair." Aurora said, conceding.

"That's me done." Alastor said with relief.

"Helen, perhaps you could cover the changes to the infirmary?" asked Albus softly.

"Yes, of course," her American accent twanged exotically as Helen sat forward, "firstly, I'll introduce myself; I am Helen Jordan, a fully trained Healer and I also hold a muggle Doctor's qualification. I specialise in paediatrics or children's care. I've worked for years at The Valley Clinic in the United States but I've had two years abroad in France and Australia before and I am pleased to be here in Scotland."

The rest of the staff were charmed by her forthright manner and Albus smiled.

"I am now in charge of the infirmary, allowing Poppy to fully focus on her duties as the school mediwitch." Helen continued. "Poppy will continue to be the initial point of contact for first aid and triage. She will determine whether I am needed to provide addition treatments. I will handle on-going treatments and check-ups where there is extensive damage. We will split night calls probably taking alternate weeks – a schedule will be posted. Neither Poppy nor I will be unhappy if you make a mistake and contact the wrong person but we would hope that you will endeavour to choose the right one so we both have a chance of rest and a week of uninterrupted sleep." She paused and looked around the gathering. "Any questions so far?"

Everybody shook their heads.

"OK, then, as of this term we will revive the practice of mandatory annual school health checks for all students. A notice will be sent to parents and guardians during the first week. They will have until the second week to refuse permission but if they do they must produce evidence that such a health check has been performed in the last twelve months for their child and there are no issues that we need to be concerned about." Helen said firmly.

"Some parents will be unhappy." Filius noted.

Helen shrugged. "More often than not those would be the parents of the children most in need of such a check. They will be informed that an attempt to withdraw the child will mean a mandatory visit from Aurors. I have more authority as a Healer to deal with suspect cases than Poppy does as a mediwitch. I understand we have twelve at-risk children? With another three whose immediate situations have been resolved but may still require assistance in coming to terms with their abuse and making a full recovery?"

Albus nodded gravely. "I'm afraid to say that we do."

"I've engaged another Healer who specialises in mind healing," Helen informed them, "he will visit as appropriate to the individual child's needs. A room has been set aside in the infirmary. Healer Allen will be arriving and departing through the infirmary floo in line with new security regulations."

"Thank you, Helen." Albus said.

"A couple of other things to mention," Helen said quickly, "one, if you wish for a full medical check-up in confidence as staff you are entitled to ask for one, and; two, after much discussion with the house elves, the menus have been revised to provide healthier options – I'd be interested in your feedback. And I'm done!" She sat back and held up both her hands.

"So, onto more pleasant things." Albus said briskly. "As you were all informed over the Summer, the Tri-Wizard Tournament will be hosted here at Hogwarts." He smiled out at his staff and was bemused when he took in the lack of enthusiasm. "Come, come! This is marvellous news! And a wonderful honour for Hogwarts!"

"Headmaster, as a historian, I am aware of the number of fatalities that have occurred in previous tournaments, what is being done to prevent a death occurring in this tournament?" Matilda prompted.

Albus beamed at her. "Thank you for your very good question, Matilda. The tournament has been revised. Only those of age by October 31st – seventeen – will be allowed to enter. The tasks have been discussed and designed to be challenging with a hint of risk to the student but no danger of imminent death. Additional security measures will be brought in during the tournament – I'm sure Alastor will brief us all at the relevant time."

"While I know it is an honour," Alison offered, "I am concerned about whether we're going to get inundated with a large number of students from the other schools in our NEWT level classes?"

"The delegations from Beauxbatons and Durmstrang will number thirty each with two staff members in attendance including the Headmistress or Headmaster. Madame Maxine has informed me that her students will not participate in Hogwarts' classes as at least five of her likely students will be Veela or part-Veela. Headmaster Karkaroff has also to date indicated a preference to school his own students." Albus explained. "They will take meals with us, and will of course have access to our infirmary and library. I believe we're also setting aside a communal Common Room where all the schools can congregate. It will not be available to those below sixth year. Otherwise I don't believe we will be that inconvenienced."

Rolanda huffed. "No, you're only growing a maze over the Quidditch pitch from the Easter holiday."

The room erupted.

Albus rapped the table sharply and brought order. "Everyone, please!" He glared at Rolanda who glared back unrepentant. "Some sacrifices will be made and once the tournament is over the pitch will be returned to its former glory. However, we will still have a Quidditch season albeit compressed into the Winter and Spring terms."

"That's barely enough time." Minerva pointed out.

"We did discuss cancelling the Quidditch season altogether." Albus pointed out crisply. "This was the compromise. Rolanda?"

"Try-outs will take place on the first weekend. The first match will be held in October with another two matches held before the Christmas break in the usual slots; one match will play in February; two in March before the Easter break. Whatever the disadvantage of playing in the likely poorer weather or first or last will hopefully be spread evenly across all four teams." Rolanda sighed.

"Any sixth or seventh year of age planning to enter the tournament may not play Quidditch." Albus informed them. "It is likely that should they be chosen by the Goblet of Fire, the demands of the tournament would be too much for them to also continue to play effectively for their team. Any other questions about the Quidditch?"

"Not a question about Quidditch but about Yule and the Ball mentioned in your announcement note." Alison said. "Is it mandatory?"

"Fourth years upwards are invited to attend. It will be mandatory for the Champions, and for the delegations from our visiting schools." Albus explained. "From a staff perspective, the House Heads have generously agreed to give up their holidays to remain within the castle."

Minerva gave a small harrumph beside him and Albus knew it was because he hadn't actually given them a choice in the matter.

"Any other staff member would be welcome to remain for the Ball or to volunteer as a Day or Night Watch Supervisor during the period. I would ask you let Minerva know by October 31st what your individual plans will be." Albus said briskly. "Would anybody else like to ask something?"

"Albus, in light of the sanctioning of the duelling club, Professor Hilliard and I thought we might suggest a Tri-School Duelling Competition. It would only involve those not chosen as champions and be limited to the sixth and seventh years. Perhaps the Quidditch rule would also apply." Filius said.

Hilliard leaned forward eagerly. "We're thinking a team of four from each school would take part. Three rounds with the winner awarded a small cup or trophy."

"Oh, what an excellent idea!" Albus said brightly. "Please write up the proposal and I will give it to the other Heads immediately for consideration."

"There seems to be a lot focused on sixth and seventh years with this tournament, Headmaster, although admittedly the Ball will be fourth years and up," Bathsheda spoke up for the first time, "however, I wonder…what about our younger years?"

"An excellent point." Albus admitted. "Perhaps I can prevail upon you all to think of some way we can make the tournament inclusive for our younger years apart from their obvious role of spectators and bring me some ideas."

The staff exchanged looks amongst them.

"Well, I believe we are now on the agenda item where I listen to any concerns you may have and open this up for discussion." Albus said. "I suggest we simply go around the room. Alastor, why don't you start?"

"You know my thoughts already." Alastor said bluntly. "Cancel the tournament. The security exposure is enormous."

Albus sighed and moved on. "Severus?"

"I agree with my colleague; the tournament will be nothing but trouble." Severus said smoothly.

"Your concerns are noted but let's move on, shall we? Are there any other concerns besides the tournament?"

"I do have one," Septima said when everyone else remained quiet, "the death threats against Harry Potter? The improved security is welcomed but the attacks at the World Cup were frightening to read about."

"The suspect is an unknown Death Eater using a reformed version of Polyjuice potion to hide his identity and he owns a house elf which causes another set of issues." Alastor replied. "The house elves are taking care of the latter and so long as the traffic in and out of the castle is monitored, we shouldn't have a problem."

"Will Potter come on the Express or is Black making *special* provision for him?" asked Severus.

"We are not releasing that information." Minerva glared at Severus.

Septima cleared her throat. "What about the safety of the other students? If this…madman decides to attack the boy on the train, others will be at risk. Surely it would be better for him to floo in and for that to be released to the press?"

Albus noted there were a few nods of agreement around the room. "The safety of all the students remains a top priority. Lord Black and I are still finalising the decision regarding Harry's travel."

"It's good thing to question. We should all consider the safety and the security of the school every day." Alastor said bluntly. "If a colleague or a student starts to show unusual behaviour, report it to myself or Minnie. Personally, I've been appalled at the security and safety deficits of previous years. I'd like to think we won't have these issues if we all practice CONSTANT VIGILANCE!"

Albus smiled brightly at Alastor and ignored his ringing ears. "Well said. Are there any other concerns? No?" His gaze swept around the room. "Then, let's have supper and toast the beginning of another year!"

He decided to ignore the eye rolling of the rest of the staff.

o-O-o

*September 1st 1994*

Harry tried very hard not to laugh at Remus's appalled expression as he regarded himself in the mirror of the guest cloakroom on the ground floor of Black Manor.

Sirius sniffed at him. "What?"

"Why do I have to be the woman?" asked Remus bluntly, running his hand over the dress Sirius had hustled him into a mere ten minutes before.

"There are just so many comebacks to that, Moony, I can't settle on one." Sirius smirked at him.

Remus glowered at Sirius.

Harry snickered.

Remus arched his eyebrow at Harry. "We could always dress *you* up as a girl, Snitch."

"Ah, but then I'd tell Aunt Minnie and she would yell at you." Harry said confidently.

"Aunt Minnie is going to yell at us anyway." Remus adjusted his new cleavage and swore. "Bras are torture devices – why the hell do women wear them? And whose bright idea was this anyway?"

"Yours!" chorused Sirius and Harry together.

And it had been. Remus had stepped in and fixed the issue about how Harry was getting to Hogwarts rather ingeniously. There had first been a leak to the press that Harry would not be on the Express, followed by a confirmation to Dumbledore that Sirius would take care of ensuring Harry arrived at Hogwarts. But all the while the Marauders had planned to sneak Harry aboard the Express; going incognito to King's Cross was part of the plan.

Remus sighed.

Harry took pity on him. "I really do appreciate it, Remus. I really want to ride the Express and you've been brilliant thinking this up." He paused. "If it helps, the dress really, uh, suits you?"

"That doesn't help, but thank you, Harry." Remus said, smoothing down the folds of the plain navy blue dress. He turned back to the mirror and pointed his wand at his face and hair. It changed slowly; the faint scars of his werewolfism faded away under the glamour, replaced by a peaches and cream complexion. He changed his eyebrows to a plucked elegant shape and his nose and chin became more refined. His hair sprouted suddenly, growing and shaping itself into a tidy chignon. He looked like a respectable lady.

"Nice, Remus." Sirius pushed him away from the mirror. "My turn." The glamour took effective immediately as he tapped his head with his wand. His black hair was replaced by a short nondescript brown cut peppered with grey. His eyes shifted to the same brown colour while his face aged and took on more wrinkles. He swept the wand down his clothes automatically transfiguring the leather blazer, white t-shirt and smart jeans into a muggle suit in a non-descript black. He turned to Harry. "Your turn."

Harry felt the wand tap his head and he could feel the magic wash over him. He hurried to take a look in the mirror and grimaced. His hair had turned the same dull brown as Sirius, his face had taken on a more rounded shape reminiscent of Neville in first year and his eyes had been turned a muddy brown. Fortunately, Sirius hadn't transfigured his clothes into something else; his blue jeans, favourite green t-shirt and grey hooded fleece had been left alone.

"Right!" Sirius ordered briskly. "It is now…" he silently did the tempus charm and the time glowed briefly in the air for a long moment. "Huh. Exactly ten o'clock." He ushered them out of the bathroom and down the corridor to the reception room and the floo.

Harry's trunk sat on the floor near to the fireplace. Dobby had helped him pack the night before, ensuring everything was clean and tidily packed away. Hedwig had decided to fly rather than travel by the train so her cage wasn't needed.

Sirius picked up the trunk. "Are you sure you've got everything?"

Harry nodded. "Dobby was very efficient." And much better at packing than Harry. Dobby had cleaned, pressed and folded the clothes very carefully; arranged all the books, equipment and the potion ingredients so that everything would be easily unpacked at the other end.

"OK. I'll go first, you follow, then Remus." Sirius said briskly.

Harry took a deep breath as Sirius went through; he followed with an encouraging look from Remus and emerged out into a floo tucked away into a corner of platform nine and three quarters. Sirius nudged him and he moved away so Remus could floo through easily. The Express was already prepped but there were only a few families already on the platform. Strangely, hardly any families arrived early; most people arrived within twenty minutes of the departure time creating a frantic platform.

"Come on, let's get you on board." Sirius said, placing a hand on Harry's shoulder. They chose a compartment near to the arriving prefects.

Sirius placed Harry's trunk in the luggage rack, after Harry had retrieved a picnic basket containing lunch, his school robes, and a book from it. Meanwhile, Remus finished placing a number of charms on the compartment; a notice-me-not which would only allow Harry's friends to find him and an alarm charm that would create a serious banshee like sound if someone with intent to harm Harry tried to get into the compartment.

"OK," Sirius said with false cheer, "I guess this is it."

Harry met his gaze and nodded. He felt choked up; unable to speak. He moved towards Sirius and got pulled immediately into a fierce hug.

"If you want to come home at any time…" Sirius began, before he stopped abruptly. When Harry felt Sirius take a shaky breath, he realised Sirius was struggling to keep his own composure.

"Thank you, Padfoot." Harry said; his words were partially muffled as they were said into Sirius's shoulder. "For everything."

"I love you, Pronglet." Sirius whispered.

Remus gently cleared his throat.

Sirius sniffed loudly and loosened his hold, allowing Harry to inch back enough to look at him. Sirius's eyes were suspiciously wet but he had a determined smile on his face. "Now, remember; do your best, have lots of fun, kiss lots of girls or boys or both…"

Harry blushed bright red.

"…and most importantly, use your Dad's cloak for pranking!"

Harry laughed at the last and gave Sirius another quick hug before stepping back.

"I guess it falls to me to be the sensible one." Remus said, opening his own arms in a request for a hug which Harry complied with speedily. "Stay safe. You see, hear or otherwise sense anything suspicious, tell Moody or Minnie or call us; OK?"

"OK." Harry moved back and made a face. "You know that hug was kind of weird with your, uh…additions."

"The girls?" Remus looked down at his bust. "Yes. I could see how it might be a little disconcerting."

"And on that disturbing note…" Sirius reached over, pulled the blind down on the window, and tapped his wand on Harry's head returning him to his usual form. "All done."

They all looked at each other.

"Best Summer Ever." Harry declared softly.

Sirius smiled. "Call me on the mirror once you're back in the dorm after the feast to let me know you're safe."

"I will." Harry promised.

"OK," Sirius said firmly, "we're leaving."

Neither he nor Remus moved.

Harry rolled his eyes. "I'm going to be fine."

Sirius sighed, gave him another gentle hug. "Be good, and if you can't be good, don't get caught." He dropped a kiss on the top of Harry's head and when he stepped away from Harry, Remus caught Sirius's arm and gently dragged him out of the compartment, closing the door softly behind them.

Harry threw himself at the nearest bench and worked on not crying for a good minute. It was stupid, Harry thought miserably; he was going back to Hogwarts – he should be happy. But there was an ache in his chest, a desperate urge to pick up his trunk and leave – return home.

*Home.*

He had one now. And it was filled with love and banter and belonging. Finally, *belonging*.

Merlin, but he missed Sirius already; Remus too. And Dobby.

He blinked back tears and told himself to stop being a baby. He was fourteen! And this was his fourth year! And it wasn't as if he wasn't ever going to see them again! He was seeing them every Wednesday for his usual duelling lesson! He shouldn't be bawling his eyes out like a first year.

There was a soft knock on the door and Harry immediately stood drawing his wand. Hermione opened the door and smiled at him happily.

"There you are!" Hermione shooed him back while she got her trunk into the compartment and he sprang forward again to help her, levitating the trunk up to the rack and sheepishly musing he should have done the same with his own.

"How did you know I was on the train?" asked Harry once Hermione settled on the bench opposite him.

"Dobby popped by and gave us a note from Sirius ten minutes ago." Hermione explained. "We decided to floo instead of driving because I didn't like the idea of you sitting alone on the train for a whole hour by yourself brooding."

Harry frowned as he considered if he was totally predictable in his reactions.

Hermione's eyes narrowed on him. "I figured that you would probably feel how I felt in first year."

"How's that?" asked Harry, staring at the corner of the compartment.

"Like you want to get off the train and go home." Hermione said bluntly.

Harry's gaze jerked back to her.

Hermione smiled self-deprecatingly. "I'd never been away from home before and I was nervous and I missed my parents as soon as I said goodbye to them and…I think I volunteered to go look for Trevor because it meant I had something to do and I could just stop thinking about home so much."

"But I'm not eleven and it's not like this is my first year," argued Harry, "you must think I'm pretty stupid to…"

"Be homesick?" Hermione supplied. "Oh Harry!" She dived across the compartment and hugged him before settling next to him, wrapping her arms around his right arm, snuggling into his side with her head on his shoulder. "This…" she said a little hesitantly, "this is the first time you've really had, well, *people* to miss, isn't it?"

Harry nodded, knowing she could feel the movement even if she couldn't see it.

"Well, see? It's perfectly normal." Hermione squeezed his arm.

For a while, Harry soaked up her comforting empathy as outside of the train the platform started to fill with families dropping off students.

"How…" Harry said eventually, "how did you cope with it?"

"Honestly?" Hermione answered, "I didn't at first. I cried myself to sleep every night for the first couple of months composing the letter I was going to write to my parents begging them to let me come home."

Harry felt incredibly guilty. He'd had no idea she'd felt that way. "And after that?"

"I had you." Hermione said simply. "And Ron, of course. It made everything better."

Friends.

Of course. Harry smiled and slipped his hand into hers. They sat in a comfortable silence for a while before there was another knock on the door and Neville poked his head inside. He grinned at the sight of them and Harry blushed a little self-conscious that he had been caught holding Hermione's hand and cuddling with her. He got up to help Neville with his trunk as Neville confirmed they'd received a Dobby delivered missive from Sirius that morning too.

Neville took the seat Hermione had vacated and Harry slipped back into his own although there was an inch of distance between himself and Hermione that hadn't existed before Neville had entered.

"I have to admit," Neville said brightly, "I'm looking forward to going back this year."

"Yeah?" Harry smiled pleased for his friend.

Neville waved his new wand. "After all the tutoring and everything, I might even keep up in class."

"I'm sure you will, Neville." Harry assured him sincerely. Neville wasn't a bad spell caster; he just needed practice. "Maybe we can help each other outside of class? I can always do with help in Herbology."

"You're on!" Neville grinned.

"That's a wonderful idea!" Hermione said. "I have to admit I just don't have a talent for the practical side of Herbology."

"Hermione, you get straight Os so I think you might have some talent!" Harry said dryly.

Hermione blushed but laughed along with Neville and Harry.

"Where is Ron?" wondered Harry. He was sure if Sirius had sent Dobby to Hermione and Neville he'd have sent him to the Weasleys too.

"You know the Weasleys," Hermione said with a smile, "they'll probably arrive at the last minute."

Another gentle knock on the door had Neville motioning Harry back into his seat as he went to see who it was.

Harry's face lit up when he spotted the blonde girl in the doorway. "Luna! Come in!" he said, unaware Hermione was gaping in surprise.

"Hello, Harry! Did you know you have Eebeebees guarding your door?" Luna asked dreamily.

"Remus put up some charms." Harry explained as he got up and helped Neville with Luna's trunk. "Do you know Neville? And Hermione?"

"We've never been formally introduced." Luna said as she sat down next to Neville opposite Hermione. "I'm Luna Lovegood."

"Neville Longbottom." Neville smiled at her warmly.

"Hermione Granger." Hermione gave her a small wave. "I thought your Dad's article about Harry was the best of the three published."

Luna's delight shone from her face and happy smile. "Thank you. He'll be pleased to hear that."

"Did you get a note delivered by Dobby telling you Harry was on the train too?" Hermione asked, clearly wondering how Luna had found them.

"Oh no," Luna said shaking her head, wide-eyed, "I was just looking for somewhere to sit and I saw the Eebeebees and knew Harry must be inside."

Hermione frowned at her. "You mean you sensed the charms?"

"If we all looked at the world the same way it would be very boring, wouldn't it?" Luna replied, deepening Hermione's frown.

Harry smiled widely and decided he should change the subject before Hermione got wound up and started to question Luna's world view too much. "You really helped me the last time we talked."

"I got your 'thank you' note." Luna said suddenly a little shy. "It's the first letter I've ever received. It was almost like having a friend."

"More than almost I hope." Harry said impulsively. "I'd like to be your friend."

"I'd like that too." Luna said simply.

Hermione's expression had softened with sympathy as though she was finally remembering the conversation about Luna that they'd had with the others at Longbottom Manor during Simeon's introduction party. "Harry was my first real friend."

"Mine too." Neville agreed.

Harry felt his cheeks heat up but he held Luna's gaze. "Ron Weasley was mine. I met him on the Hogwarts Express in my first year."

"Ginny and I used to have play dates when I was small." Luna commented. "But when we started lessons, Mummy and Mrs Weasley didn't agree on what we should learn so we stopped."

"That's a shame." Hermione said, shifting on the bench slightly. "I guess it doesn't help that you're separated by the Houses at Hogwarts either otherwise you could have renewed your acquaintance again."

"That's part of it." Luna agreed softly.

"My Gran said there's going to be an Inter-House Common Room for the upper years," Neville informed them, "for the thing we're not supposed to know about."

"You mean the Tri-Wizard Tournament?" Luna said with a knowing smile.

Harry's eyes widened. "Your Dad showed you the press release?"

Luna nodded, kicking her feet out to stare at her toes. "He's very excited."

"We know about the tournament but have been told not to say anything," Hermione said, staring at Luna's toes herself as though trying to work out what was so fascinating, "the Headmaster wants to surprise everyone at the feast tonight. But never mind that, what does the tournament have to do with the lower years not getting a Common Room?"

"The other schools aren't bringing anyone below sixth year." Harry said. "The Common Room is supposed to encourage international sharing and bonding."

"I think we should request one Common Room for first through third, and another for the fourth and fifth years." Hermione said, taking out her organiser and making a note. "We might not be able to do the international sharing but it should encourage inter-house bonding."

"But all feet need a big toe." Luna said suddenly.

For a moment they all stared at her.

"You mean someone to make it work? Right. Robert will see to the upper years," Harry suggested, "he's Head Boy this year."

"You'll manage the fourth and fifth years." Hermione said and as much as Harry wanted to argue with her, he knew it would be expected.

"What about you for the lower years, Luna?" asked Neville gently.

Luna looked surprised and shook her head sending her blonde hair flying. "Oh, nobody follows something they can't see."

Harry felt his anger stir again at how Luna must have been treated for her to make such a comment. "Who would you suggest?" He asked instead.

"Matthew Inglebee." Luna said simply.

Lydia's twin, Harry mused. Matthew was a good-humoured likeable guy with an easy-going personality. He'd gone into Hufflepuff but he was smart and ambitious if a little overshadowed by his more talkative and effusive Gryffindor twin sister. Harry enjoyed talking with him when Lydia wasn't around.

Harry nodded. "Matt would be a good choice."

"I think so too." Neville said. "He's very popular in his own year."

Hermione agreed. "I've seen him helping the younger years out in the library."

"So, Neville and I can talk with him when we get to Hogwarts." Harry said.

"We still need to get permission." Hermione cautioned him, but her brown eyes were shining with enthusiasm. "A petition maybe?"

"Sounds good." Harry said. "We should talk with the prefects too. If they support it and offer to spend some time in the Common Rooms 'supervising' we'll probably get permission for it."

"If we organise that in the next couple of days before school starts on Monday, maybe we can have the Common Rooms up and running by this time next week." Neville said enthusiastically.

"It's ambitious," Hermione tapped her chin with her quill, "but doable. Let me see, we'll need…" she bent her head over her organiser scribbling notes and Neville shot Harry a smirk as they both looked at her.

"Are you looking forward to the tournament, Harry?" Luna asked, sitting back and folding her hands over her stomach.

Harry lifted a shoulder in a half-hearted shrug. "It might have been nice to have met some foreign students but as the ones who are coming are all older than we are, I doubt they'll socialise with us much."

"I'm with Harry," Neville said, "I'll go along to watch the tasks and cheer on the Hogwarts Champion but I'm not really that fussed about it."

Hermione sniffed. "Personally, I think the tournament's aims are good but its record is very spotty; two of the Champions died in the third task last time."

"My Daddy thinks it's a very bad idea." Luna agreed. "One of the Champions that died was his friend."

"Oh, how horrible!" Hermione exclaimed, looking up. She frowned. "Your Dad went to Hogwarts though, didn't he? I thought the two who died were from the other schools."

"Francine was friends with my Mummy – she went to Beauxbatons instead of Hogwarts because Grandmére was French." Luna explained. "Daddy lived next door to Mummy growing up so…"

"So he got to know her friends from school." Hermione finished. "How awful that your Dad and Mum had to go through something like that!" Her gaze drifted to Harry and he gave her a reassuring smile.

"Don't worry, Hermione," Harry said firmly, "I have no intention of entering the tournament. Sirius says they're putting a whole heap of protections around the artefact so it'll be impossible for someone underage to enter."

"It won't stop some people trying." Neville commented, raising his voice to be heard over the clamour of people shouting on the platform outside. "Tri-Wizard Champions used to be able to write their own futures after winning; they had the pick of the available Mastery slots and the open job positions. Then there's the fame and the money."

Harry shrugged. "I don't need any more fame and I'm comfortable. I'm quite happy for someone else to go ahead and get the glory while I have a quiet year for once." He sighed. "You know how I was thinking of Quidditch after school?"

Neville and Hermione nodded while Luna looked on curiously.

"Terry started with his team and he was saying that there's a lot of publicity and talking with the fans and…" Harry gave a mock shudder. "I just want to play Quidditch!"

"So maybe a Quidditch playing career isn't for you." Hermione said practical as ever. "You have a lot of other options." She motioned at Luna across the compartment. "What about you, Luna? What are you thinking of doing after school? Are you going to follow your father into journalism?"

Luna seemed shocked someone had asked her a serious question. "Well…I was thinking of writing books about rare magical creatures perhaps a travelogue where I would write about my adventures trying to find them." She confessed with an easy smile.

"That sounds like a very good plan." Hermione said briskly. "I want to go into Healing, combining muggle and magical techniques like The Valley Clinic in the States."

Luna's silvery eyes went unfocused for a moment and she spoke without seeming to realise she was speaking. "Yes, the most successful plants are always well-rooted so their flowers can reach for the sun."

It was a strange comment and Luna smiled dreamily at their bemused expressions. She was covering up her self-consciousness at the manifestation of her gift behind a mask of oddity, Harry realised.

"So Hermione will be successful if she remains well-rooted in both worlds?" Harry said interpreting her words.

Luna beamed at him.

Hermione arched an eyebrow at Harry but she turned back to Luna with a warm smile. "That's a lovely insightful thought, Luna. Thank you." She motioned at Luna. "I have to admit I've had some doubts about Divination but…how long have you had your gift?"

"For as long as I can remember." Luna admitted. "Grandmére was a full Seer. Compared to her, I only see glimpses." Her silver eyes blinked back her surprise at having her words recognised as Seer insight instead of craziness. "I don't have a lot of control over it. Most people find it disturbing."

And therefore most people found Luna disturbing, Harry mused sadly. He was glad that he'd welcomed the younger girl into the compartment and resolved again to be her friend.

"I think that's because most people hate hearing the truth." Hermione said firmly. "So, if you come from a line of Seers maybe you can answer my questions about Divination?"

Harry and Neville exchanged a knowing look as Hermione and Luna settled into a lively discussion about the subject Hermione had walked out on the year before. The boys chipped in when they could but mostly watched on.

"GET A MOVE ON, RONALD!"

The yell from outside arrested all talk within the compartment.

"Was that…" asked Neville nervously.

"Molly?" Harry nodded. He checked the time. It was almost eleven. The Weasleys were cutting it very fine.

A few moments later, Ron staggered into the compartment, the door sliding shut behind him. Neville and Harry assisted him with his trunk.

"You owe me one, mate!" Ron said as he collapsed onto the bench beside Hermione.

Harry retook his seat with a grin. "I do?"

"You should have heard her when Dobby popped in with Sirius's message! 'How could he leave him there on his own!'" Ron mimicked his Mum's voice. "'What was he thinking?!'" He snorted. "Like Sirius doesn't take every precaution known to a wizard where your safety is concerned! She's going to send him a Howler – I'd bet you anything she does! I delayed her as long as I could so she couldn't come aboard and give you an earful!"

"Thanks, Ron." Harry smiled at him as the whistle blew outside.

Ron frowned as he looked around the compartment, doing a double take at Luna before giving her a polite nod. "Where's Ginny?"

Harry, Hermione and Neville looked at each other questioningly and back to Ron.

"She had a sleepover with Lydia last night." Ron explained. "I guess she hasn't found the compartment?"

"Well, not everyone understands the Eebeebees are guards and would understand why they're here." Luna pointed out.

Ron gaped at her in bewilderment.

"The charms Remus put on the compartment were supposed to turn away those Harry considers a threat or who are a threat but let any of Harry's friends through," commented Hermione logically, "but maybe if Ginny doesn't know Harry's on board, she hasn't looked?"

"True," Ron said, "she wouldn't have known. We thought Sirius was going to floo with him until Dobby turned up."

"Or maybe Harry considers her a threat." Neville teased, smiling at Harry.

"Well, Ginny and Lydia together are a threat!" Ron said with a grin. "They're a threat to Harry's virtue!"

Harry reached around Hermione and whacked Ron on the head as they all laughed. "Oy!"

The train lurched forward. They were on the way back to Hogwarts.

o-O-o

"Stop sulking, Sirius." Remus threw a sandwich wrapper at him across the train compartment. He'd lost the female form he'd had when they'd hidden themselves away, lost the bra (Sirius never wanted to see Remus go topless ever again) and he'd transfigured his clothing back to plain wizarding robes.

Sirius glared at his friend. "I don't know why we couldn't have stayed in the same compartment with Harry." He had also ditched the disguise and was much happier back in his jeans and leather jacket ensemble.

"Because Harry's experience of travelling on the train with his friends – the experience he wanted – wouldn't be the same if we were in the compartment with him!" Remus stated with more than a little exasperation, which Sirius understood since it wasn't the first time they'd had the discussion since deciding on the plan to get Harry to Hogwarts.

"You were in his compartment last year!" Sirius whined anyway.

Remus rolled his eyes. "More like he was in mine. Look, Sirius, Harry needs to get used to being away from us – you! You need to let him go. The moment of goodbye at King's Cross is traditional. Harry's subconscious and your subconscious will acknowledge it as such and recognise it as a traditional parting of ways for parents and children. If he knew we were aboard or if we'd travelled together, it would have been delayed until Hogsmeade making things more difficult for you both."

He was right but Sirius wasn't going to give Remus the pleasure of admitting that. He took another bite of his own sandwich and wondered if Harry was enjoying the picnic basket Dobby had made up for him and his friends.

He'd been pleased to see Hermione arrive early and followed fairly swiftly by Neville. Luna's entry into Harry's compartment had been a surprise since Sirius hadn't sent her a message but that she'd found Harry had to mean Harry accepted her as a friend. Ron's late arrival wasn't unexpected – the Weasleys as a family ran on their own time. Sirius had hunkered down hearing Molly's strident tones on the platform. He suspected that he had a Howler in his future despite the fact that Remus's plan was quite ingenious.

They'd arrived early at the platform disguised to ostensibly drop off a child; check. They then warded Harry's compartment to the hilt and made it so only his friends could enter; check. They notified a few of his closest friends so they could find him; check. They took up a position in the next compartment which they made all but invisible to everybody just in case someone had sussed out the rest of the plan; check.

The latter was handy because they had to go to Hogsmeade anyway and move into the new house. Sirius wasn't actually looking forward to that. He loved Griffin House. The new house wouldn't have memories of Harry sprawled on the living room floor watching a movie, sat at the dining table eating treacle tart, or curled up in an armchair by Sirius's desk reading while Sirius worked.

On the other hand, regardless that Griffin House was a floo away from Hogwarts, Sirius was comforted with the knowledge that he'd be physically closer to Harry with the new house. If anything happened…

And he couldn't shake the feeling that something might happen.

Noshi's warning kept ringing in his ears; how Harry would be injured and Sirius would take him back to Noshi to heal.

No.

No, it wasn't inevitable. Hadn't he and Noshi discussed how prophecies and visions might give the impression of things that really weren't what they seemed?

Sirius would never stop believing that he could keep Harry safe. But he had to admit that he hated turning Harry over to the care of Hogwarts; of Albus Dumbledore who had already failed on so many levels to keep Harry safe.

Not that Sirius thought he was doing a bang up job of it himself either since Harry had almost been kidnapped at the World Cup.

He sighed.

He'd admitted his mistake in leaving Harry at all and not getting him away as soon as the news of the stadium fire had reached him. Harry had admitted his mistake in running after the bastard that had attacked them. They'd both learned. And it was a major part of why Sirius felt he was making another mistake, he acknowledged to himself. Hadn't he learned leaving Harry in someone else's care meant that he wouldn't be there to keep Harry safe? But Harry had promised – *promised* – that he only wanted a quiet normal school year; that he had his animagus project to keep him occupied; that if anything strange or unusual or mysterious occurred that got his attention he would tell someone – he wouldn't go charging in himself.

"Will you stop worrying? I can hear your mind whirling from here!" demanded Remus, looking up from his book to glare at Sirius. "And for Merlin's sake, finish your sandwich!"

Sirius did the mature thing; he stuck his tongue out.

His mirror buzzed.

Sirius immediately dumped the sandwich on the seat beside him and yanked the mirror from his inside pocket. "Padfoot here."

Minerva's face appeared in the mirror. "Sirius."

"Minerva." Sirius said brightly, inwardly wincing.

"The Headmaster has asked me to contact you regarding Harry's arrival."

In other words, Albus was bugging Minnie about when Harry was expected to arrive and by what method since Sirius had point blank refused to tell him.

"We're on the Express." Sirius informed her briskly. "Harry's in the next compartment." He continued cheerfully. "According to Remus we can't travel with him or he won't experience the full Express, um, experience."

Minerva closed her eyes as though trying to remain calm. She opened them again to glare at him. "Then he'll arrive with the other students?"

"Yes, that's the plan. Remus and I will disillusion ourselves, see him onto a carriage and follow it up to the gates." Sirius said firmly.

"You do know the press is going to have a conniption fit." Minerva sighed.

"Serves them right for printing rumours and leaked information!" Sirius retorted. That had pissed him off although it was part of the plan.

Minerva nodded. "I'll be at the doors to make sure he gets inside safely."

Sirius nodded back, his eyes roaming over her tired features. "How are you, Minnie?"

She sighed. "I'm all recovered." Her features softened a touch; the stern lines easing. "Try not to worry, Sirius." The mirror went blank.

Sirius tucked it back into his pocket. He picked up his sandwich and discarded it again. He shifted restlessly, an urge to sneak to the compartment next door and just check on his son. Of course, he reflected, he would probably have to stun Moony first.

"You're not stunning me and checking up on Harry." Remus said, startling Sirius. He looked up in amusement at Sirius's shocked face. "You're very predictable, Padfoot. Eat your lunch and do your correspondence. I thought you wanted to write some letters?"

"How am I supposed to focus on letters?" Sirius complained forcefully. He got to his feet and paced. He hadn't felt so adrift since…since he'd lost Lily and James and *Harry*. He lurched to a stop. "It's like I've lost him again, Moony."

The wave of emotion as he confessed the truth of the sick aching feeling in his gut had him immediately seeking a refuge…his usual refuge; he turned into Padfoot, slumped to the floor and gave a miserable whine.

Remus immediately set aside his book and dropped to the floor of the compartment. He patted the floor next to him and Sirius sidled up to him, eventually settling with his head on Remus's thigh, Remus's strong hand stroking his head gently.

"Forgive me, old friend," Remus said softly, "you've been doing so well, I forgot you see. You've hardly done this since you came back from the States."

Sirius knew he'd been Padfoot a lot at the beginning of the Summer when he'd had too many painful emotions to cope with despite his want to be there for Harry. But once he'd been given Harry coupled with the healing he'd had…he'd needed to be Padfoot a lot less. Moreover, he hadn't wanted to be Padfoot. But right at that moment…Padfoot was safe.

"You're doing brilliantly." Remus said firmly. "You've given Harry a home and he…he loves you beyond anything, Sirius. He's going to come home; you're not going to lose him; I promise."

But Moony couldn't promise that, *nobody* could promise that. And that's what scared Sirius.
