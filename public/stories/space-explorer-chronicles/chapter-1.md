# The Signal

"Captain, you need to see this."

Captain Nova looked up from her console to see Lieutenant Chen standing in the doorway of her ready room, excitement barely contained in her expression.

"What is it, Lieutenant?"

"It's a signal, ma'am. Coming from the Kappa Sector. But it's like nothing we've ever seen before."

Nova was on her feet immediately. Kappa Sector was supposed to be empty. Uncharted. There shouldn't be *anything* there, let alone a signal strong enough to be detected from three light-years away.

The bridge was alive with activity when she arrived. Every screen showed the same thing: a waveform that defied classification. It wasn't radio, wasn't subspace, wasn't any form of communication they knew.

"Analysis?" Nova asked, sliding into her command chair.

"Unknown, Captain." The science officer, Dr. Kess, shook her head. "The signal pattern suggests intelligence, but the encoding is completely alien. And it's repeating the same message every 47.3 seconds."

Nova studied the waveform on the main viewscreen. There was something almost musical about it, a pattern that seemed to resonate at a frequency that made her bones ache.

"Distance?"

"Two point eight light-years. If we push the engines, we could be there in six days."

Six days. In deep space, that wasn't long. But it was long enough for things to go wrong. Long enough to step into the unknown.

Nova made the decision instantly. "Set course for the Kappa Sector. Maximum warp. Let's see what's calling us."

As the stars shifted on the viewscreen, stretching into the telltale streaks of faster-than-light travel, Nova couldn't help but feel that this was the moment she'd been waiting for her entire career.

First contact. It had to be.
