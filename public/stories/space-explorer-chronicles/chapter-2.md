# First Contact

Six days later, the ship dropped out of warp at the edge of the Kappa Sector. The signal was stronger now, almost overwhelming the sensors.

"There," Dr. Kess said, pointing to a display. "It's coming from that asteroid cluster. But... the readings don't make sense."

Nova leaned forward. The asteroid cluster was exactly where the signal originated, but the composition readings were all wrong. The asteroids appeared to be made of materials that shouldn't exist—elements that weren't on any periodic table they knew.

"Visual scan," she ordered.

The viewscreen zoomed in, and the bridge fell silent. These weren't asteroids. They were... structures. Geometric shapes that floated in space, connected by glowing bridges of energy. Lights moved between them in patterns too organized to be natural.

"It's a station," Lieutenant Chen whispered. "Or a city. But how?"

As if in response to their presence, one of the structures began to change. Panels shifted, reconfiguring into something new. A docking bay, perhaps? An opening, at least, large enough for their ship.

"Captain," the communications officer said, "we're being hailed. Audio only. And... I think it's in our language?"

Nova's eyebrows rose. "Put it through."

The voice that filled the bridge was strange—not quite mechanical, but not quite organic either. It spoke slowly, carefully, as if learning each word.

*"Welcome, travelers. We have been waiting. Please, dock your vessel. We wish to speak."*

The crew exchanged glances. This was unprecedented. Aliens that could speak their language before ever meeting them? It suggested technology beyond anything humanity possessed.

Or something else entirely.

"Respond," Nova said. "Tell them we're coming. But keep shields up and weapons ready. We're here to learn, not to trust blindly."

As the ship moved forward, Nova watched the alien structures grow larger on the viewscreen. First contact. It was finally happening.

And she had no idea what to expect.
