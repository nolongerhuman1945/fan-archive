# Chapter 4

The problem with discovering you'd been someone's lab rat seventy-three years ago was that it didn't actually answer any questions. It just created better ones.

Aris sat on the hotel bed at four in the morning, laptop screen casting blue light across his face, reading the same paragraph for the fifth time. Dr. Volkov's notes referenced Project Genesis like historians referenced the Library of Alexandria—with reverence for what had been lost and frustration at how little remained.

*Subject Zero represented a breakthrough in quantum manipulation that subsequent programs failed to replicate. The original research data was destroyed in the 1952 facility fire. All attempts to recreate the process resulted in unstable subjects (see: Projects Resonance, Cascade, Helix). Recommendation: locate Subject Zero if still viable. Estimated age would place subject in seventies; longevity effects unknown.*

Aris closed the laptop and lay back, staring at the ceiling. Age seventy-three, if they'd started with a ten-year-old in 1949. Except his body stubbornly refused to acknowledge the passage of time the same way normal people did. He'd looked thirty-five for the past forty years. Before that, he'd aged normally until his mid-twenties, then the process had just... stopped.

Another question without answers.

His phone buzzed. Text from Natasha: *You awake?*

*Unfortunately.*

*Good. Meet me in the gym. Third floor. Fury wants those baselines.*

*Now? It's 4 AM.*

*Spies don't keep office hours. You coming or not?*

Aris considered claiming exhaustion, but truth was, sleep felt impossible anyway. His mind kept circling back to upstate New York, 1949, a facility that had burned and a boy who'd walked away with abilities he still didn't fully understand.

*Five minutes,* he typed back.

The Triskelion's gym occupied a corner of the third floor, windows overlooking the river. At this hour it was empty except for Natasha, already warmed up and moving through a series of stretches that would've made a yoga instructor jealous. She'd traded her tactical gear for workout clothes that showed the lean muscle of someone who fought for a living.

"You look terrible," she said without preamble.

"Didn't sleep."

"Nightmares?"

"Existential dread. Close cousin." Aris dropped his jacket on a bench and rolled his shoulders. "What are we doing?"

"Fury wants data on your abilities. Limits, applications, energy signatures." She moved to the center of the mat. "I volunteered to help collect it."

"How generous."

"I'm curious." She settled into a ready stance, weight balanced, hands loose. "You caught bullets in Prague. Turned a quantum anomaly human in the Caucasus. But I've never seen you fight."

Aris understood what she was asking. "You want to spar."

"I want to know what you can do. There's a difference." Her expression was all business now, the friendly drinking companion from last night replaced by Black Widow, SHIELD operative. "Don't worry. I'll go easy on you."

He had to laugh at that. "Sure you will."

They began slowly—Natasha testing his reactions, Aris defending without committing to offense. She moved like water, fluid and adaptable, each strike flowing into the next with practiced efficiency. No wasted motion, no telegraphed attacks, just clean technique refined through years of training.

Aris blocked, deflected, retreated. His abilities hummed beneath his skin, reading her body's electromagnetic signature, tracking the neurons firing as she decided which move came next. He could see her attacks half a second before they landed, respond to intentions rather than actions.

"You're holding back," Natasha said, circling. "I can tell."

"So are you."

"Fair point." She came in faster this time, a combination that would've dropped most opponents—high kick to draw his guard up, spinning elbow to the ribs, sweep to take his legs. Aris flowed around it, not blocking but simply not being where she expected. The electromagnetic signatures shifted, her neurons rerouting, compensating—

Her fist stopped an inch from his throat.

"Interesting," she said. "You're reading my nervous system."

"Is that a problem?"

"No. Just explains how you're so damn slippery." She reset, considering. "Can you do the opposite? Disrupt someone's nervous system instead of just reading it?"

Aris thought about the two bodyguards in Prague, unconscious on the warehouse floor. "Yes."

"Show me. Non-lethal."

"You sure?"

"I've been tased before. Won't kill me."

He reached out with his abilities, found the bioelectric field surrounding her body. Natasha's nervous system blazed in his perception—billions of neurons firing in complex patterns, voluntary muscle control, autonomic functions, the constant background chatter of a human brain maintaining consciousness.

One small pulse. Carefully calibrated. Just enough to—

Natasha's left leg buckled. She caught herself, dropping to one knee, and looked up at him with something that might have been respect.

"Temporary disruption," Aris said. "Your leg will work fine in about thirty seconds. I can target specific muscle groups or knock someone unconscious entirely. Doesn't work well on multiple targets at once—too much to coordinate."

She stood, testing the leg. "Range?"

"Thirty meters for precision work. Fifty for a blanket pulse, but that's much less controlled."

"Drawbacks?"

"Headaches if I overuse it. And it only works on biological nervous systems—won't help against robots or AI." He paused. "Also, doing it feels invasive as hell. Reading nervous systems to predict attacks is one thing. Actively disrupting them feels like reaching into someone's skull."

Natasha studied him with those calculating green eyes. "You have ethics about your powers."

"I have preferences. There's a difference."

"Not much of one." She moved to the weight bench, pulled out a tablet from her bag. "Let's try the other stuff. Energy absorption and redirection. There's a ballistic dummy in the corner—reinforced torso, sensors to measure impact force. I'm going to hit it as hard as I can. Then you're going to hit it."

The dummy stood six feet tall, human-shaped, covered in impact-resistant material. Natasha approached it, settled her stance, and drove a straight punch into its center mass. The sensors beeped. The tablet displayed the reading: 425 pounds of force.

"Solid punch," Aris noted.

"I try. Your turn."

He approached the dummy, pulled back his fist, and stopped. "Just regular strength, or...?"

"Regular first. Then we'll test energy enhancement."

His punch registered 380 pounds. Respectable for someone his size, nothing superhuman.

"Now channel some energy into it," Natasha instructed. "Not enough to break the dummy, just enough to boost your strength."

Aris drew power from the ambient electromagnetic fields in the room—the building's electrical grid, the Earth's magnetic field, the heat radiating from the rising sun. He felt it flow into his muscles, enhancing the biochemical reactions that produced force.

The second punch registered 1,240 pounds.

Natasha whistled. "That's Captain America territory. Can you go higher?"

"Probably. But after a certain point, my body becomes the limiting factor. Too much power and I'll shatter my own bones from the recoil."

"Noted." She made a notation on the tablet. "What about absorption? Can you take a hit and redirect it?"

"That's kind of my whole thing, yeah."

She retrieved a pneumatic launcher from a storage locker—the kind they used for testing body armor. Loaded a rubber projectile about the size of a baseball. "This fires at approximately 90 miles per hour. Think you can stop it?"

"Should I be insulted that you're starting this low?"

"Call it professional caution." She aimed the launcher at his chest. "Ready?"

Aris nodded. The launcher fired with a pneumatic hiss.

The projectile stopped six inches from his torso, its kinetic energy bleeding off into his outstretched hand. He felt the impact like a warm pulse, the force converting to thermal and electromagnetic energy that he could manipulate at will.

Then he flicked his wrist and the projectile shot back, slamming into the launcher's barrel with enough force to dent the steel.

Natasha set the launcher down carefully. "Okay. I'm officially impressed."

"Wait until you see my card tricks."

They spent the next hour running through variations. Different projectiles, different speeds, different energy types. Aris absorbed thermal energy from a blowtorch, redirected it to freeze a glass of water. Drew electrical current from a live wire, used it to power a laptop. Manipulated the electromagnetic spectrum to become functionally invisible for three-point-two seconds before the headache forced him to stop.

By six AM, Natasha had two dozen pages of notes and Aris had a splitting migraine.

"That's enough for today," she said, noticing him wince. "Pushing through pain isn't brave, it's stupid."

"Is that from the SHIELD manual?"

"From experience." She handed him a water bottle. "You did good. Fury will want to see the data, but I think we have enough for a preliminary assessment."

Aris drank half the bottle, the cold water helping slightly with the headache. "And the assessment is?"

"That you're exactly what SHIELD needs for the weird shit we keep running into." She packed up the tablet and equipment. "Also that you have very specific limitations you're probably not telling me about."

"Everyone has limitations."

"Sure. But most people don't get a splitting headache from three seconds of invisibility." Her gaze was sharp, penetrating. "What happens if you push too far? Best case and worst case."

He considered lying. Considered deflecting. But Natasha had spent the last hour watching him demonstrate abilities that made him dangerous, and she'd done it without flinching. That earned some honesty.

"Best case, I pass out and wake up six hours later with a killer hangover," he said. "Worst case, I lose control and everything within thirty meters gets hit with an uncontrolled energy pulse. Could range from knocking everyone unconscious to stopping hearts."

"Has that happened before?"

"Once. Berlin, 1973. I was younger, less controlled." The memory still made his chest tight. "I woke up in a hospital with no memory of the previous six hours and a lot of very nervous doctors who couldn't figure out what had caused a localized blackout that killed four people."

Natasha absorbed that without visible reaction. "And now?"

"Now I know my limits. I don't push past them unless I have no choice." He met her eyes. "In the Caucasus, with Subject Zero-Seven, I came very close. If it had gone wrong, we'd both be dead and the facility would've been a crater."

"But you didn't lose control."

"I got lucky."

"I don't believe in luck." She slung her bag over one shoulder. "You made a choice to save someone at considerable risk to yourself. That's not luck, Kaine. That's character."

Before he could respond to that, the gym door opened. A young agent—couldn't be more than twenty-five, wearing the standard SHIELD uniform—approached with the stiff formality of someone delivering bad news.

"Agent Romanoff. Director Fury requests your presence immediately. Priority Alpha."

Natasha's expression shifted instantly, professionalism snapping into place. "What's the situation?"

"Classified, ma'am. But he said to bring Mr. Kaine as well."

They exchanged a glance. Priority Alpha meant something major—terrorist threat, enhanced individual incident, or worse.

"We're right behind you," Natasha said.

Fury's office looked different in the early morning light. The windows showed Washington DC waking up, commuters beginning their day, completely oblivious to whatever crisis was brewing in the Triskelion's upper floors.

The Director stood by his desk, tablet in hand, expression grim. "We have a situation."

"So I gathered," Natasha said. "What is it?"

Fury tapped the tablet and a holographic display materialized above his desk—satellite imagery of a facility Aris didn't recognize. European architecture, mountainous terrain, significant damage to multiple structures.

"This is a SHIELD safe house in the Swiss Alps," Fury said. "Twelve hours ago, it went dark. No communications, no check-ins, nothing. We sent a team to investigate." He swiped to the next image—bodies in tactical gear, sprawled in unnatural positions. "Four agents dead. Another six missing. Whatever hit them, it was fast and thorough."

"HYDRA?" Natasha asked.

"Don't think so. The agents weren't shot or stabbed. They were..." He zoomed in on one of the bodies. The skin looked desiccated, as if something had drained every drop of moisture. "Mummified. In seconds, based on the timestamps from our security feeds."

Aris felt something cold settle in his stomach. "What was being stored at this safe house?"

Fury's one eye fixed on him. "That's classified."

"If you want my help, it stops being classified right now."

A long pause. Then: "Artifacts. Recovered from HYDRA, AIM, and various other organizations engaged in enhanced research. Items too dangerous to destroy, too valuable to lose. We have seventeen facilities like this scattered globally."

"And now someone's raiding them," Natasha said. "How many artifacts were taken?"

"Three. All related to energy manipulation and absorption." Fury brought up an inventory list. "A Red Room prototype designed to store bioelectric energy. An AIM device that could theoretically convert matter to pure energy. And something we recovered from a HYDRA facility in 1987—project designation unknown, extremely high energy signature."

The year 1987 made Aris's skin prickle. He'd been in that HYDRA facility. Had walked out with three bullet wounds and a device he'd handed to a CIA contact who'd promised it would be safely stored.

Apparently SHIELD had acquired it instead.

"You think the attacks are related to the artifacts," he said.

"I know they're related. We've detected similar energy signatures at two other compromised facilities. Someone with abilities like yours is hitting our storage sites and stealing anything that could enhance their powers." Fury leaned forward. "I want you to find them before they hit facility number four."

"Where's facility four?"

"New York. Lower Manhattan. Underground vault that houses our highest-level assets." Fury pulled up architectural schematics—a complex network of reinforced chambers built into the bedrock beneath an innocuous office building. "If they hit this one, they get access to items that make those three artifacts look like firecrackers."

Natasha stepped closer to the holographic display, studying the vault's layout. "When's the expected attack?"

"Unknown. Could be days, could be hours. We're enhancing security, but if this individual can drain life force and manipulate energy, standard defenses won't hold." His gaze shifted to Aris. "That's where you come in. You can sense energy signatures. Fight someone on their own terms."

"You want me to walk into a trap," Aris said.

"I want you to spring one. With proper support." Fury gestured to Natasha. "Romanoff will coordinate tactical. We'll have a full team on standby. Your job is to identify the attacker and neutralize them before they can access the vault."

"And if I can't?"

"Then we seal the vault with you inside and hope you're strong enough to survive until reinforcements arrive."

Wonderful.

Natasha was already pulling up tactical data on her own tablet, mission mode fully engaged. "What do we know about the attacker? Physical description, abilities, any identifying features?"

"Limited intel. Security footage shows a figure in black tactical gear, approximately six feet tall, moves with enhanced speed and agility. The energy absorption happens through direct contact—they touch victims and drain them in seconds. Beyond that..." Fury shook his head. "We're flying blind."

"Time frame?" Aris asked.

"You leave in two hours. Transport's being prepped now. Agent Romanoff will brief you on the vault's layout and security protocols en route." Fury's tone made it clear this wasn't a request. "I'm authorizing lethal force if necessary. Whatever this is, it doesn't leave that vault alive."

They left the office in silence, taking the elevator down to the operations level. Natasha's fingers flew across her tablet, pulling up files and schematics, already three steps ahead.

"You don't have to do this," she said quietly. "You're freelance. This isn't your fight."

"Someone's out there killing people and stealing artifacts related to energy manipulation. That makes it my fight." Aris watched the floor numbers descend. "Besides, you heard Fury. If this person gets access to whatever's in that Manhattan vault, things get much worse."

"Could be a suicide mission."

"Isn't that what makes it fun?"

She looked up from her tablet, studying his face. "You're scared."

Not a question. An observation.

"Yes," he admitted. "Someone who can drain life force through touch is a very bad matchup for me. My abilities require focus, concentration. Hard to maintain that when you're being mummified."

"Then we don't let them touch you." She pocketed the tablet. "I'll be there, Kaine. Full tactical support. You won't be alone."

"Romanoff the bodyguard. I'm touched."

"Don't be. I'm protecting the asset." But her slight smile suggested otherwise.

The two hours before departure passed in a blur of preparations. Aris changed into tactical gear SHIELD provided—black combat fatigues, reinforced at stress points, designed to allow full range of motion. He armed himself with weapons he hoped he wouldn't need and equipment he definitely would: electromagnetic scanner, communication headset, a knife because you always carried a knife.

The USB drive with Volkov's research went into a waterproof case strapped to his chest. If this went sideways, if he didn't make it out, at least the data would survive.

Natasha found him in the armory, checking the weight distribution on a tactical vest.

"Second thoughts?" she asked.

"Third and fourth ones. But I'm going anyway."

"Good." She handed him a small device—looked like a watch but felt heavier. "Emergency beacon. If things go completely to hell, press the button. It'll trigger a building-wide lockdown and flood your location with SHIELD's rapid response team."

"How fast is rapid?"

"Six minutes from signal to arrival."

"Long time when someone's trying to drain your life force."

"Then don't let them touch you." She adjusted the vest's shoulder straps with practiced efficiency. "We'll establish a perimeter outside the vault. Motion sensors, thermal cameras, the works. You'll have eyes from multiple angles. And if you need extraction, I can be inside in under thirty seconds."

"You're going to get yourself killed protecting me."

"Nah. I'm harder to kill than I look." She stepped back, assessing his gear with a critical eye. "You're ready. Or as ready as anyone can be for this kind of thing."

They took a Quinjet to Manhattan, the stealth aircraft making the trip in under an hour. Aris spent the flight reviewing the vault schematics, memorizing every entrance, every potential choke point, every place an attacker might exploit.

The vault sat beneath a building SHIELD maintained as corporate offices—some fake consulting firm that existed primarily to launder operational funds and provide cover for agents in the field. The real action happened thirty feet below street level, in a series of chambers carved from bedrock and lined with exotic alloys designed to contain energy signatures.

They arrived at noon. The building looked normal, office workers moving through the lobby, completely unaware of the arsenal sitting beneath their feet. Natasha led him through security checkpoints, each one more elaborate than the last, until they reached the vault's primary entrance.

Three-foot-thick steel door. Biometric locks. Pressure-sensitive floor panels. Enough security measures to make Fort Knox jealous.

"Welcoming," Aris muttered.

"Wait until you see the inside."

The vault proper was a circular chamber, maybe forty feet in diameter, lined with display cases and storage lockers. Each one held artifacts that glowed faintly through reinforced glass—objects that hummed with power even through multiple layers of shielding.

Aris's abilities reached out instinctively, cataloging the energy signatures. Some he recognized—Chitauri technology from the Battle of New York, a Tesseract fragment that made his teeth ache, what looked like a prototype arc reactor predating Tony Stark's design. Others were complete mysteries, emitting wavelengths he'd never encountered.

"Don't touch anything," Natasha warned. "Some of these items are unstable. One wrong move and we're explaining to Fury why half of Lower Manhattan is a crater."

"Comforting thought."

She moved to a control panel and began setting up the security net. "Cameras are live. Motion sensors active. I've got six agents stationed at the perimeter—if anyone tries to enter the building, we'll know."

"And if they're already inside?"

"Then we have bigger problems." She handed him a communication earbud. "Stay on this channel. Any change in energy signatures, any feeling that something's wrong, you tell me immediately."

Aris fitted the earbud and activated it. "Testing."

"Loud and clear." Her voice came through crisp and professional. "I'm heading topside to coordinate with the tactical team. You have the vault."

"Lucky me."

She paused at the door. "Kaine. Be careful."

Then she was gone, the massive door sealing behind her with a pneumatic hiss.

Alone in a vault full of dangerous artifacts, waiting for someone to try stealing them.

This was fine. Everything was fine.

Aris settled into a position where he could observe the entire chamber, back against a support pillar, electromagnetic scanner in hand. The device hummed softly, painting the vault in false colors—energy signatures overlaid on physical space. The artifacts shone like stars, each one unique, each one potentially deadly.

Minutes crawled past. Then an hour. The scanner showed nothing unusual. The comm channel stayed quiet except for occasional check-ins from the perimeter team.

Aris let his abilities extend further, reaching through walls and floors, mapping the building's electromagnetic topology. Normal office equipment above. Power grid operating within standard parameters. No anomalous energy signatures, no fluctuations that might indicate—

There.

A spike in the EM spectrum, faint but distinct, coming from the northern wall. Not inside the vault yet, but close. Moving.

"Romanoff," he said quietly into the comm. "I have contact. North wall, approximately ten meters outside the vault perimeter. Energy signature unlike anything I've seen—high-frequency, rapidly shifting."

"Confirmed. Thermal's picking up an anomaly in that section. It's not showing human—temperature's all wrong." A pause. "Kaine, I'm coming down."

"Negative. Stay topside. If this goes bad, I need you coordinating the response team."

"If this goes bad, you'll be dead before the response team arrives."

"Then I'd better not let it go bad."

The energy signature moved closer. Through the wall now, approaching the vault's outer defenses. Aris felt the security systems activate—motion sensors, pressure plates, electromagnetic barriers designed to stop conventional intrusion.

They lasted three seconds.

The barriers collapsed, not breached but drained. Something was pulling power directly from the security systems, converting their energy into fuel. The same way Aris absorbed kinetic force or thermal radiation.

Someone with his abilities. Or something close enough to make no difference.

"Perimeter defenses are down," Natasha reported, strain creeping into her voice. "All of them, simultaneously. Whatever this is—"

"It's like me," Aris finished. "Someone who can manipulate energy. They're draining the systems."

"Then hit them before they reach the vault."

Too late. The main door groaned, metal warping as massive force pressed against it from outside. Not explosives. Not hydraulics. Pure energy, converted from the building's own power grid, forcing the door open through brute application of power.

The locks failed. The door swung wide.

And through the opening stepped someone Aris recognized.

Not personally. But the figure's proportions, the way energy crackled around their limbs, the sense of barely contained power bleeding off in waves—

He knew what he was looking at. Because he saw it in the mirror every morning.

Another Subject Zero.
