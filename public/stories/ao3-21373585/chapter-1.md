"I feel fine. Honest."

Izuku sat in a wooden chair in Recovery Girl's office just after completing the entrance exam. Or, well his attempt to complete it. He didn't do too well. It ended in him broken and battered with zero points.

"Nonsense. I may have used my quirk on you, but breaking your legs and an arm until they burst open is more than simple injuries." Recovery Girl said as she continued to test Izuku's reflexes and joints. "Even if you really are fine, you must be utterly exhausted. Just give me a few more minutes and you'll be-"

*\*Knock-Knock\**

The door to the office suddenly opened to reveal Present Mic, wide smile present as ever. "What's up, Recovery Girl?!"

"Too loud!"

"Eh- Sorry. We got another one for ya." Present Mic moved out of the way to reveal who he was talking about. Izuku's heart stuttered at the sight of the girl who walked in. 

She was slender, but there was some muscle on her arms. Her deep purple short hair, violet eyes, and rosy lips contrasted against her porcelain white skin. Said hair had a zagged soundwave-like streak across it, which made it all the more alluring to Izuku. Her eyes looked bored to most, but the only word Izuku could find was "intense". It was as if she was looking right through him, yet judging him at the same time. 

She was wearing a red tank top with the words "Deep Dope" on the front with a black spaghetti strap tank top underneath hugging her curved body. Her wrist had a spiked punk bracelet, and on bottom she wore black joggers and checkered tennis shoes. But, the most noticeable and intriguing thing about her was her ears. More specifically her earlobes. Her ears had long headphone jacks on each one. However, one was bleeding and bruised.

"Oh, what happened?" Recovery Girl asked, moving to check the girl's quirk as Present Mic took his leave.

She twirled her good jack around her finger and responded, "I stuck my jack in one of the robots, but I couldn't get it out. When it fell down, it landed right on it. They're pretty durable, so I really don't think its too bad."

"Nonsense, you poor thing. Come here." The girl walked over to Recovery Girl and received a smooch on her jack from the old woman. The small appendage suddenly glowed and went back to normal. The old nurse grabbed a wet rag and wiped the remaining blood away. "There you go. Now before you leave, take a seat and regain your bearings. Even small injuries like that can be exhausting due to my quirk. 

Before the girl could respond, a chair was pulled up less than a foot next to Midoriya's right, and she was sat down in it. Izuku's body locked up instantly. Just being in her vicinity was apparently too much. "U-Uh, I'm feeling a lot better now. I should go."

"Oh, alright then. Here, have some gummies." Recovery Girl began searching around in her pockets, but found nothing but lint. "Oh! It looks like I've run out of candy. Don't worry, I'll go get some more."

"It's fine. I-I really don-"

"You just wait right there. I'll be right back. I just have to run to the store and get some more."

"Wh-?! The store!? But you-"

"I'll be back!" She closed the door, leaving the teens to themselves. Izuku sat wide-eyed in his seat, his body refusing to move. He didn't know what to do. His years at Aldera had made sure that he was terrible at talking to people in general, but a pretty girl? It wasn't that he was *scared* per say, but he didn't know what to say. Middle School had taught him that keeping his mouth shut was usually the best solution. 

He was done for.

However, this wasn't Aldera. This girl didn't know him. Hell, hopefully nobody at this place did. 

The last time he had talked to a girl was…

*'Oh God, when was the last time I talked to a girl?'* His mom didn't count. Any female teachers didn't count. And he didn't remember talking to any girl classmates before everyone besides Kacchan and his group, which didn't have any females, began ignoring him. *'**Wait! What about the girl out front? I talked to her right? I tripped and she caught me. Then, she said something. And then I...sat there...like an idiot...I'VE NEVER TALKED TO A GIRL!!!'*

The realization sent Izuku spiraling. What was he supposed to do? Well, he technically didn't have to talk to her. They were strangers, and that didn't mean they had to suddenly try and get to know the other. Granted, All Might told him that he had to get at least a little bit better at social activity if he was to be a hero someday. But, Toshinori also never said *when* Izuku had to start learning.

And starting off his social improvement by talking to an attractive girl was WAY TOO MUCH. He needed to work up to it slowly...for about 10 years. 

So, the conclusion was made. He would sit in comfortable silence, wait for Recovery Girl to get back, leave, cry himself to sleep because he had failed All Might, his mom, himself, and he would never achieve his dream, have All Might take his quirk back because he didn't deserve it, and then finally sink even further into the dark void of crippling depression.

Perfect plan.

There was just one problem.

Her quirk.

Izuku watched as she tested out her previously injured jack to make sure it healed properly. She inserted her jack into her phone and began playing music. The analyst and quirk obsessor in him was screaming at him to ask her all about it. He had never seen anything like it. 

But, he couldn't! 

It would mean talking to her, and he couldn't handle it. He would shut down and embarrass himself even further. It was simple.

 Just. Don't. Ask.

The teen clamped his mouth shut, and sat quietly...for about 15 Seconds. His left eye began twitching, and his right eye moved in all directions. His cheeks were puffed out from containing his words, and he was sweating profusely trying to hold in his question.

Izuku kept it up for a few minutes, keeping his cool. His body relaxed, and he exhaled. 

What do you know? He did i-

"What's your quirk?"

*'...Damn it.'*

The girl turned to him, a brow raised "What?"

"U-Uh... What's your quirk? I'm really interested in quirks, and yours looks really cool."

"Oh, uh...Well, it's not all that great." Izuku watched as she began looking around and avoiding direct eye contact, playing with the hem of her shirt, searching for words, etc. It was comforting to see someone almost as shy as he was. "I can channel the sound of my heartbeat through them, causing vibrations and soundwaves and all that. I can capture sound too."

"Wait, hold on!" Izuku shot out of his seat and grabbed a pen and a piece of paper from Recovery Girl's desk. He sat back down and began writing quickly. "Please, continue."

She raised a brow, but rolled with it. "Oookay? My sense of hearing is pretty off the scale."

"Do really loud noises hurt?"

"Sometimes. It's really only if I'm focusing in on it."

"Can you hear through walls?"

"Yeah. Especially if I plug my jacks into 'em."

"With a quirk like that she can be perfect for hostage situations and some villains with sound based quirks; it's amazing how sound goes both ways for her, that can be very useful. I wonder how powerful the vibrations get and if she can amp them up with speakers like Present Mic's gear. It's possible that-" 

Kyouka gazed in shock as Midoriya spiraled into muttering to himself. As someone who was a singer and lived with vocalists, she could safely say that Izuku had the greatest breath control she had ever seen. "Are you alright?"

Izuku snapped out of it, blushing as he realized what he was doing, "Wh-What? Oh, I'm sorry. I go off on tangents like that a lot."

"So, one minute you're Porky Pig, and then Eminem the next. Gotcha."

"I...guess that analogy works. Thank you for humoring me, really."

"It's no problem." She went back to playing her music through her jacks, and Izuku couldn't help but smile to himself just a little.

*'Holy crap. an actual conversation. First in years. We've got time, apparently. Maybe I should keep this going?'* But, there was another issue. '*How the heck do I do small talk?'*

Was he supposed to just start talking about whatever is on his mind? Or was he supposed to find an icebreaker? Or was the quirk interrogation the ice breaker? No matter what, he couldn't let the opportunity slip from his grasp.

Things hadn't gone well for Izuku since...well, since the day he was born. After looking back on his past, he could safely say Kacchan was never actually his friend. At least not in the blonde's eyes. To him, Izuku was just another follower, albeit one he knew for longer than the others. Izuku might've still looked up to Katsuki, but friendship was apparently never on the table.

When he made that realization, he realized that he really never had a real friend before. He stopped bothering to even tempt the idea a long time ago. And, it had looked like having one wasn't in the cards for him and never would be as long as he was quirkless. Even after obtaining One For All, Izuku had his doubts.

But, maybe that girl was his chance. Already having a friend going into U.A would be amazing. Well, if he actually had passed the test, which he was 99% sure he didn't. But, he had to have at least a little hope.

Maybe, for once in his life, he could have a friend. A real one, that is.

...Who was also a gorgeous young woman.

*'...I'm screwed.'* Izuku shook his head and steeled himself. *'C'mon, you're not falling apart. Come on Izuku, think of something! Anything! Just say something!"*

Izuku looked down her over once more and saw her "Deep Dope" t-shirt, punk bracelet,  and her musical themed phone case. Music! He probably should've guessed from the headphone jack earlobes. He wasn't exactly an enthusiast, but he could work with that.

"U-Uh…" Kyouka looked at him once more. Her eyes met Izuku's and he froze. He could tell that she was just as shy as him, but he still couldn't speak. Jirou clearly looked like she was into punk rock. 

Punk Rock. One topic. All he had to do, was not mess it up.

"...Do you like jazz?"

Izuku watched in horror as Jirou's eyebrows slowly rose in response to his question. It was literally the exact opposite of what he was supposed to ask. He didn't get to actually talk to the brunette that saved him from falling, but the universe had taken pity on him for once, and gave him a second chance to befriend someone.

And he had completely screwed it u-

"Pfffft! Hahahahahahahaha!" Kyouka began laughing hysterically, nearly doubling over in her chair, and Izuku became even more confused. The purple-haired teen clutched her sides as she laughed harder and Izuku sweated even more nervously.

He had only one more thing he could think of.

Play along.

"U-Uh...Hehe. Ahaha. Hahahahaha!" The boy began trying to laugh along with her and act like what he said was actually a joke. As the girl calmed down, she waved him off.

"Dude, it's alright. I know it wasn't a joke. It was just too funny to me." She wiped a tear from her eye and smiled at him. "I'm glad to know that there's someone who's just as bad at all this as me."

Izuku rubbed the back of his neck and looked down at his lap. "S-Sorry. Guess I'm not used to talking to girls...Or anyone for that matter."

"Hey, I get it. I usually come off as cold and indifferent, so I don't really have that much social experience either. Although, I definitely don't start off conversations like that, Porky." she said, smirking at him.

Izuku tried to hide in his arms, "I-I don't know what's wrong with me."

Kyouka chuckled and tried to pry his arms away from his face. "C'mon, man, I didn't mean it like that. I was just teasing." 

Izuku lifted up a brow and gazed at Kyouka. Teasing? Light-hearted teasing? Teasing that wasn't directly meant to mock and emotionally hurt him? This girl was an even bigger phenomenon than he had first thought.

"C'mon, I really didn't mean anything by it. What's your name? I can't keep calling you Porky. It's not fitting."

"Izuku Midoriya."

"Kyouka Jirou. I'll lighten up on you if it really bothers you."

"No! N-No it's fine. It's actually a nice change of pace."

"Good, because I've been thinking about more nicknames for you, Mop-Head. Okay, not my best one, but what do you think, Green Bean?"

"What have I gotten myself into?"

"You're the one that started off the conversation with 'Do you like jazz?' So you tell me." Izuku couldn't help but chuckle. The two continued their conversation for quite some time. As the minutes passed, Izuku slowly wished Recovery Girl just didn't come back to the office.

He was actually talking to someone, and she actually seemed to enjoy talking to him too.

 Jirou wasn't overly energetic or anything like that. She was funny and clearly friendly, but very mellow. Her eyes always remained in their unenthused state, but he could see passion and life in them. Her smile was small, but it fit her face so perfectly. She was...calming. Just being in her presence made Izuku's stressful life seem easy. She was a little shy at first, but once the ice was broken she was talking with him like they had been friends for a long time.

And, oddly enough, that alone helped Izuku feel comfortable too.

Kyouka couldn't believe that she was happy to have crushed one of her jacks. But, it allowed her to meet a dork like Izuku. A dork in a good way. 

Adorkable. 

She wanted to throw up at the fact that she thought about that word, but she couldn't find a better way to describe him. 

"What I really wanted to ask you about was your shirt. Deep Dope is a punk rock band right?"

"Oh yeah, they're my favorite band. Who do you listen to?"

Izuku rubbed the back of his neck and blushed, "I don't think I really have one. I just kind of listen to whatever I think sounds good."

Kyouka feigned sorrow, "Oh, you poor thing. Here, listen."

She plugged on of her jacks into her phone and her other pressed against Izuku's head just ahead of his ear.

"What are you doing?" Izuku asked in shock at the sudden touch.

"Trust me. Just listen." She hit play on her phone, and music began coursing through Izuku's head.

"Wh-...How are-?"

"Bone conduction. Pretty cool, right?" Izuku nodded in response as he listened to the music. Punk Rock definitely wasn't something he would have ever thought he would like, but it was actually a good song. Although the band name was definitely questionable.

"The Sex Pistols?"

"Not the weirdest band name, believe me."

"I'll take your word for it."

Kyouka chuckled as the two looked at one another and smiled. Even with Kyouka's jacks stretched out, the two had unconsciously moved closer to share the phone. The teenage girl looked at Izuku as he closed his eyes and listened to the music. 

She couldn't deny his green hair and diamond freckle pattern combo were memorable. Her inner self was also noticing something else. He was very cute, arguably pretty handsome. He didn't have stereotypical masculine features like sharp and high cheekbones or a broad chin. But she could see the potential of a strong jawline under some lingering baby fat that would probably come off soon. Kyouka thought back to pictures of her parents when they were her age and how different they looked after only a couple of months. 

Kyouka also couldn't help but stare at his eyes. He opened them up for a brief second, and shimmering orbs of emerald met her violet ones. His forest green and black tufts and ruffles of hair came down just over his eyebrows of matching color. All of his features combined into an amalgamation of good looks that could only get better with age.

It also helped that Kyouka noticed he was utterly jacked. The top piece of his tracksuit was off, leaving him in a black t-shirt. And while she could only see his arms up to about half of his biceps, she could definitely tell he worked out.

A lot.

Kyouka was never one to ogle at guys. She had too much to work towards, and she figured no one would ever really be interested in her anyway. But, it seemed the Quirk Nerd had caught her inner teenage girl's attention.

15 years of life, and the first guy she starts to notice is the one that asked her about jazz.

...Yeah, that was about right.

The song slowly faded out, and the two continued to look at one another. Their close proximity not going unnoticed. Izuku opened his mouth, "H-Hey, Jirou? I-"

*~"Making my way downtown. Walking fast. Faces pass and I'm homebound."~*

Kyouka's eyes shot completely open as she threw her phone across the room in a panic. She whipped back down into her chair and stared at a wide eyed Izuku. "...Uh"

She shot her jacks out and pressed them against his throat. "You. Heard. Nothing."

"Y-Yes, ma'am!" Both went back to sitting straight forward, each ignoring what had happened. 

Kyouka for embarrassment.

And Izuku for keeping his life.

"...Sooo...What's *your* quirk?" Izuku turned to her at the question. "You asked me about mine, so now it's your turn."

She saw him immediately start to squirm in his seat. What was the problem? Was it really weak? So weak that he was embarrassed by it? So weak that he...Oh.

"Did your test not go well?" Izuku began rubbing his hands together and looking down at his lap, his expression downtrodden. "Hey, it's alright."

"I-I had a lot of stuff that depended on me passing...and I didn't score a single point." Kyouka's expression saddened as well. She not only felt bad for him, but she was sad that she wouldn't get to see him at school. She had spent 45 minutes really getting to like him, and then suddenly it became likely that she would never see him again.

"Maybe you can apply for the General Studies? Or maybe the Support Course?"

Izuku shook his head, "I can't. I needed the Hero Course for more reasons than one. I've spent my entire life dreaming of taking this test and going to this school, of being a hero. And now it's probably all over."

Kyouka frowned, "It can't be. I mean, there has to be more factors to this test just blowing up damn robots. If that's really it, then this school is stupid. It's a test for *the Hero Course.* I, uh...Did you help anyone? That has to count for something, right?"

"I did help this one girl. She was about to be crushed by the Zero Pointer Bot because she was trapped under some rubble."

"What did you do?"

"I destroyed the robot."

"..." Kyouka used her pinkie to clean out her ears, and then wiped off her jacks, putting one near Izuku's mouth. "Would you repeat that, please?"

"...I-I destroyed the Zero Pointer."

"The Zero Pointer? The battle robot the size of a God-damn skyscraper?"

"Um...Yeah."

"...How!?"

Izuku twiddled his thumbs and looked around nervously. This was the first time he would ever have to lie about his quirk. It was so strange to not say he was quirkless for once. "Well, my quirk is a body enhancer. I jumped into the air and punched it."

"...And you failed the test?"

"...I mean, it was worth zero points. It was the only thing I destroyed."

Kyouka looked around baffled before turning back to Izuku. "Midoriya, dude...You destroyed a freaking Zero Pointer in one punch! Why would they not take you!?"

"Well, my quirk has a bad backlash. I can't control my strength yet. So, whenever I use my quirk, it breaks my bones."

"Well, it's still...Okay that is a pretty bad backlash. But still! This school is meant to teach us how to control our quirks to be heroes. If they don't take you, then they're not doing their jobs. You were willing to break yourself to help a girl. You deserve to be here more than anyone. Especially the blonde dick in my testing zone. He kept using his quirk to blow everything up. He didn't care who was caught in the explosion. He just ran around like a psycho the whole time."

A blonde dick that used explosions to blow stuff up and didn't care about anyone else? Clearly it was Katsuki, and she just called him a blonde dick, and a psycho.

...Izuku knew then and there that Kyouka was destined to be his friend.

"I hope you're right."

"Trust me. You're getting in. I'm sure of it now."

"Well, I hope I'm in your class."

"Me too." Kyouka's phone vibrated, and she went to where she threw it to pick it up. After reading the text, she turned to Izuku. "My parents are wondering where I am, and at this point I think Recovery Girl got lost. We should just bail."

"O-Oh. Yeah, okay." Izuku was saddened that his time with Kyouka had ended, possibly for good. He didn't know if he would see her again, but he knew a few things.

 She was the first girl he had talked to in recent memory. She was his first friend, even if possibly short lived. She was the first person his age to treat him nicely in over a decade.

And he would never forget her.

The two grabbed their bags and left the building, making their way to the front gate. Once at the front gate, Izuku looked down the street with a sigh. "I should go look for her, just in case she really did get lost."

"I'd come with, but I really do have to go," Kyouka shrugged, nodding in the other way down the road.

"I understand. U-Uh, Jirou. I-...I just wanted to say thank you. For everything back there. It really does mean a lot to me, more than you know. I don't know if I'll get accepted, so I don't know if I'll see you again. But I-" Izuku's eyes widened as Kyouka suddenly cut him off and shoved a piece of paper in his hands. "Wh-... What's this?"

"It's my number. Did you really think that after all of that I would just let you go? You found out that *'A Thousand Miles'* is on my playlist. I can't let you wander around unchecked." Izuku chuckled, but Kyouka's cold glare bored into him. "That wasn't a joke."

"...O-Oh."

"But, I also think you're a pretty cool guy, Midoriya. I don't know, there's just something about you. Besides, I need someone to hang out with while we agonizingly wait for the test results. I've also made it my personal mission to broaden your musical taste."

"Like *'A Thousand Miles'?*"

"Shut up!" Izuku ducked under her jacks as they attacked him...and he was laughing. He was being attacked, and he was *laughing.* He wasn't scared, he wasn't crying, he wasn't being burned or punched. It was playful and fun.

...He could get used to that.

She eventually caught him and shook him with vibrations. "Don't make me regret giving you my number, Midoriya."

"I only promise to try."

Kyouka chuckled, "I guess that's all I can ask of you. If I text you and ask to hang out this Saturday, would you come?"

"Jirou, you know I'd walk a thousand miles just to-"

"STOP!" 

"That's the last time, I promise," Izuku laughed as he backed away, successfully avoiding getting hit that time. Kyouka glared at him before whipping around and walking away. "Wh-? Jirou, I'm sorry!"

She kept walking...

"Jirou!"

And walking...

"...We can hang out at a karaoke place on Saturday and I have to sing all the songs you choose for me."

She stopped, turned around, and smirked. "4:30. The Songbird Karaoke Club. The one with the big blue sign downtown. I hope you like western boy bands."

And like that, she was gone. 

Izuku couldn't help but smile as she walked out of sight. Even if he didn't pass the exam, Kyouka made everything feel a whole lot better, and now he finally had a friend.

...Who was a girl.

Who he was hanging out with on Saturday.

Alone.

Just the two of them.

"...Oh boy."
