Toshinori yawned as he stood from his desk in the empty faculty office. The other teachers had already gone to grab lunch while he stayed back to register some last minute drafts for internships. 

With a lull in incoming requests, he figured it was time for a break. Making his way to the door, he opened it up…

...To find Young Jirou marching towards him with a wild look in her eye, and Young Midoriya not too far behind.

Toshinori then casually closed the door, stretching out his arms. "Ah, welp, time to hit the ol' dusty trail." He swiveled around, quickly making his way towards the other exit. 

"Oh no you don't!" The teacher felt something wrap around his stomach and pull him backwards, sliding him back to his original spot. Sighing, Toshinori turned around to accept whatever fate awaited him. 

"...So, how may I help you?" A gold paper was suddenly shoved in his face.

"What the hell is this?!" 

Toshinori lowered Kyouka's hand as he backed up, "Something I thought you would be far happier about."

Kyouka sighed, looking back at the request form in her hand as she shook her head, "Well, I...I don't...I don't know what to think. Isn't this, ya know, kind of a big deal!?"

Izuku untangled Kyouka's jacks from around Toshinori before speaking up, "I have to agree with Kyouka. You haven't taken any internships in years."

Toshinori shrugged, sitting down on the desk behind him, "That was due to the obvious," he said, gesturing down at his skinny body. "But, Young Jirou here knows about me, so there's nothing to worry about there."

"What about favoritism? Kyouka asked. "You already have Mr. Aizawa breathing down your neck because of Izuku, but now you single out a student for your internship, which you have *never* done before."

Toshinori nodded, "True, however, everyone knows if I sent out multiple requests I'd be stuck with a bunch of students. Picking one lucky kid to be my intern isn't that far fetched."

Kyouka crossed her arms, leaning back on her hip, "Okay, then how about this? Let's see, who should All Might pick to have an internship with? Hm, let's see, what about HIM!!!" Kyouka punctuated her sarcasm with both arms thrusting towards Izuku. "The one you're actually *supposed* to be teaching!"

"Voices down, please," Toshinori whispered with urgency, hoping no one had heard from outside the door. "If Young Midoriya wants to join I'm more than happy to send out another request. But, honestly, I didn't think he'd want to."

"..." Kyouka looked at him with the most "Are you stupid?" face Toshinori had ever seen. Even Izuku furrowed his brow in confusion. 

"Okay, that sounded far stupider than I intended. That's not what I meant. I mean, he's been working under me for over a year now. I figured this was his chance to study under other heroes, be taught things I can't teach him, go to places he's never been before, really branch out."

Mulling it over, Izuku realized All Might had a point. His hero journals were all about learning from every hero he could analyze, so this was the same. He had All Might as a mentor, and that wasn't going to change anytime soon. The internships were his only opportunity to gain experience with other pros.

Izuku hummed to himself, nodding his head, "It's not a bad idea."

"See?" Toshinori gestured to his protogé as he looked at Kyouka. "And, not to mention you're a permanent staple in our little group now. Learning how to work together properly can't be a bad thing."

Kyouka sighed, pressing her lips together as she mulled everything over, "I...I'm not sure…"

"The guest rooms at the agency have been compared to five star hotels."

"I'm in."

All Might chuckled, taking a pen from the desk and handing it out to Kyouka. “Then we have a deal.” Kyouka took the pen, signing her name on the request form. “Alright, I’ll take this and get it registered.”

"I'm still worried about the paparazzi. People here at school are also going to go crazy." 

"That's the real kicker," Toshinori said as he reclined back on his hands, "we don't have to tell anyone. Well, scratch that. Aizawa will know, and of course my agency workers will. But, I've had multiple interns go under the radar before. My agency knows how to keep things away from the media. They've been dealing with them for years now. They understand the importance of privacy. Besides, the media stopped hanging around my agency once I quit going there. It shouldn't be a problem."

"What about our friends?" Izuku chimed in. "They're going to ask what request you accepted. It'll look really suspicious if you refuse to answer them."

Kyouka blew a raspberry, shrugging her shoulders, “I guess we’re about to find out how good I am at dodging questions for the next week.” She turned back to All Might, “Speaking of dodging questions, you said you stopped going to your agency because of your injury. How are you going to hide it?”

"With any luck, I won't be seeing much action. So keeping my muscular state around the employees should be much easier. Some of the upper management knows, it was unavoidable. But, they should help keep my cover when necessary.” 

Izuku sighed, "I guess that just leaves me. I still don't have any idea who I'm going to choose."

"Well, we still have a lot of requests to go through," Kyouka assured him. "We'll find someone."

Suddenly, a computer on Toshinori's desk dinged, the printer sending out a new paper. "Oh, whaddya know? Another request just came in for you, my boy."

Izuku perked up quickly, "Oh! From who?"

Toshinori picked up the paper and read, "Hm, let's see. From the retired pro, Gran To-..." Toshinori quickly tossed it in the trash. "Ah, you don't want that one." 

"Bu-"

"No, no, I knew that guy. Waaay too intense. I'm sure yo-" The printer suddenly expelled another paper. Toshinori picked it up and read it aloud. "Toshinori, I know you threw the last one away. Let me teach the damn boy, you big buffoo-Oh c'mon."

Izuku quickly grabbed the paper from All Might's hands, reading who the sender was. "Gran Torino? I've never heard that name before."

Kyouka scoffed, "If you, of all people, don't know it, he must've been retired for a while."

Toshinori sighed, running a hand through his hair as he sat down at the desk, "Gran Torino...was my old mentor."

For a moment, Izuku grew confused, "I thought you said your predecessor was a woman...and dead."

Toshinori waved his hands as he shook his head, "No, no, no, not her. They both taught me. Gran Torino and my master were close friends. He knows everything. One For All, All For One, all of it. He must've seen your performance in the festival and decided he wanted to see you in action for himself."

Izuku gasped, "Do you really think I impressed him that much?"

"Um...Yeah, s-sure…" Toshinori replied, his eyes shifting to the side.

"...Oh dear God."

"Look, Torino isn’t one to show praise unless it’s well earned. But, he’s a tough teacher. He won’t hold back, but...I guess, if there’s anyone who can help you, it would be him. If you want to intern with him, be prepared.”

Izuku looked back down at the paper, thinking about the offer. It was the opportunity of a lifetime. To be taught by All Might’s teacher? He couldn’t pass it up. Izuku grabbed the pen from the desk, signing his name on the line. “I can handle it.”

After a curt laugh, Toshinori ruffled his hair, “I know. Alright, now this should be interesting.”

Kyouka groaned, “Oh boy, I have to tell my parents where I’m going. Unlike our friends, I can’t lie to them.”

“A-Actually, I might have a solution for the situation with our friends,” Izuku responded. “It might raise suspicion towards our.. *.personal* affairs, but it should give you a solid excuse. We could just say you and I are going to the same internship. We worked together in the festival, we established our image as a team. It wouldn’t be that strange for us to get requests from the same heroes. We could say we chose Gran Torino because we learned he was a teacher during All Might’s time at UA.”

Toshinori rubbed his chin, shrugging his shoulders, “That’s not too bad, actually. I’ll have to run it by Nezu first, so he can have it on record that you both went to Gran Torino. Having a set alibi on paper is a pretty solid idea.”

Kyouka nodded, “I can run with that lie.” She looked back and forth between the other two, shaking her head, “I’ve known about you two for three days, and I’m already caught up in this crap.”

Toshinori quickly pointed at her jokingly, “You can’t back out now!”

Kyouka chuckled, “Yeah, yeah, I get it. C’mon, Izuku. At least now we don’t have to sort through all those papers.”

“Oh, I almost forgot,” Toshinori interrupted, catching their attention. “Young Jirou, you also got another late request. I guess I should be fair and still give the other heroes a chance,” he said with a chuckle.

“Who from?”

“Ah, it’s a request from Uwabami. It looks like she sent quite a few requests to other girls. Don’t get me wrong, she’s a wonderful woman. But, every year she requests girls she thinks are pretty to model in her commercials and such. It’s not exactly helpful.”

Kyouka cleared her throat, looking off to the side with a blush, “Y-Yeah, I wouldn’t want to do that stuff.” 

Toshinori furrowed his brow slightly at the reaction, but left it alone. “Alright, I should get up to Nezu and tell him the new plan. You two should get back to class, lunch will be over soon.” The couple nodded, leaving the faculty office and back to the hallway.

“...I told you that you could be a model.”

Kyouka lightly jabbed Izuku with her jack, “Shut up.”

  
  

…..

**(After School: Class 1-A)**

*Knock Knock*

Aizawa sighed, dropping his pen and turning towards the door. “Yes?”

The door opened, revealing Toshinori on the other side. “Just the man I wanted to see.” Toshinori walked in and placed the request form down on Shouta’s desk, sliding it towards him. “Nezu has already talked to you about my request, right?”

Aizawa picked up the paper, humming to himself as he glanced up at Toshinori. “Yes, he did.”

“And, he talked to you about what we’re going to do to keep this matter private to us alone?”

“Yes.”

Toshinori nodded, pocketing his hands with a sigh as he was desperate to leave without any interrogation. “Alright, perfect, I’ll see you later the-”

“Wait.” All Might grimaced, turning back around with an act of confusion on his face. 

“What’s up?”

Aizawa stared at Toshinori, examining him for any signs of faltering. “...Why?”

“Why what?”

“Why any of this?” Shouta lifted up the request form, “Why Jirou?”

Toshinori shrugged, “I mean, did you think she performed poorly in the Festival?”

“No, not at all. She surprised me, honestly. What I mean is, Jirou’s quirk doesn’t line up with yours at all. And, the number one hero’s request is a big deal, which one would assume goes to the winner. Or, at least one of the top three.”

Toshinori was doing his best to hold it together under pressure. He had hoped Aizawa didn’t care enough about his business to interfere. That’s usually how it went, but understandably this act raised too many questions. He had to be stern, hold his ground. “What can I say? I like the underdog. She was up against some of the most powerful students UA has ever enrolled here, and she scored first in two events, and held her own against Young Todoroki of all people. Young Bakugou might have won, but he doesn’t need me to teach him anything. Mostly because he doesn’t want it. And, you and I both know there’s a lot more to hero work than quirks. I don’t mean to pull seniority on you, but I’ve experienced far more than you could even understand in my years as a hero. I have plenty to teach, despite my lack of expertise in that profession.”

Shouta raised a brow, but nodded with a hum, seemingly accepting that answer. “And I assume you want to keep this quiet so the media doesn’t interrupt you? Along with the students acting up, too.”

“Yep, the last thing I want is for Young Jirou to be ostracized for being picked over others. Besides, I know if I sent out a lot of requests, people wouldn’t even think about other heroes. I can barely manage a class, so I think I’ll keep it to one student for now.”

“Right, but...It’s been years since you’ve taken interns from UA, much less anywhere else. We both know why.” Aizawa said, gesturing towards All Might’s body. “So, why after all this time did you decide to take in another intern, especially with the secret of your current physical state?”

Oh boy, Aizawa was digging even deeper than Toshinori thought he would. “I won’t be doing anything strenuous during the internship. I’ll be able to keep my usual public appearance up for longer than usual. And, being a teacher to all these kids has inspired me to take up interning again. I think it should be fun.”

Shouta hummed to himself once more, taking the answer. Toshinori finally relaxed as it seemed he was out of the woo- “One more thing.”

*‘God-damn it.’*

Shouta stood from his chair, picking up another piece of paper as he walked around and leaned on his desk. He raised the paper up, “I just got this a little bit ago. Midoriya’s request form. So, you’re saying you didn’t think about choosing Midoriya as your intern? An underdog, in his own way. His quirk is similar to yours, but he can’t control it fully. And, of course, you’ve taken a liking to him since the beginning. If anyone had something to gain from being your intern, it’d be him.”

*‘...Shit.’* Toshinori cleared his throat, “Well, I did offer it to him, if I’m being completely honest with you. I didn’t want to say anything because you would accuse me of favoritism, as usual. He declined anyway, so I figured it wasn’t important.”

Shouta squinted at Toshinori suspiciously, “He declined?”

“Yes, I’m afraid.”

“...He declined an offer from you, for a retired pro from years ago?”

...To think, All Might had been doing so well.

Toshinori began to scramble for a logical excuse, deciding on one in his panic, “It’s because I recommended him. Gran Torino was my homeroom teacher. When I asked Young Midoriya if he wanted to intern with me, I also gave him the option of calling up my old homeroom teacher who helped me with my own powers when I was in school here. I’m already his teacher now, so he jumped at the chance to learn from the man who taught the number one hero.”

Shouta furrowed his brow, “So, let me get this straight, you recommended your homeroom teacher to Midoriya. And, you’ve decided to intern with Jirou. And, as much as I’ll sound like Nemuri saying this, it’s obvious Midoriya and Jirou have a strong affinity towards one another. So much so, that you and Nezu’s cover story is that they both went to the same internship with Torino. Your involvement in Midoriya’s life seems to be more than I initially thought.”

“Huh, I didn’t even think about that. It’s just one big coincidence, honest. Like you said, Young Midoriya would benefit the most from people who might understand his quirk, so I figured either me or Torino. And, like you said, Young Jirou and Young Midoriya seem to have a history. They were the “Dynamic Duo,” as Mic liked to call them. Like everyone else, I was impressed by them both. It just turned out this way.”

Aizawa peered at All Might again, deciphering the info he had just been given. “...Right. I’m sorry for accusing you of anything. I just want to look out for my students.”

“I understand. My work here is done for the day, so have a good evening.” Toshinori took his leave, exiting the classroom. Once the door was closed behind him, he groaned with hands on his knees. “Ooooh God-damn it.” 

If Shouta was suspicious of him before, it seemed this was the straw that broke the camel’s back.  

…..

**(Jirou Household)**

Kyouka ate another piece of salmon as she leaned back in her seat at the dinner table. Izuku and her had separated after school, their cover story about going to the same internship had gone well. Later, All Might gave her a location to meet her on the first day of internships so they can catch a train to Tokyo. Now, it was time to break the news to her parents.

“So,” Mika started, “no Midoriya tonight?”

Kyouka shrugged, “He might come over later. He’s just spending time with his mom right now.”

Kyoutoku perked up at that, “How is that going by the way? Is everything doing alright at home?”

Mika leaned over and kissed his cheek, “Aw, honey, you do care about him.”  
  

Kyoutoku sputtered, puffing out his chest, “Wha-? N-No I don’t! He’s pervin’ on my daughter, and walking around here like he owns the place! I hate him!”

Kyouka rested her chin on her hand, “Dad, you know how when people lie their voice gets naturally higher?”

**“I don’t know what you’re talking about,”** her father replied, his quirk making his voice much deeper. Kyouka merely continued to smirk at her dad in silence. “...He must never know.”

“I’m absolutely going to tell him. Izuku will be happy he’s wedged his way into that old heart of yours. And, yes, everything is going fine at the moment.” Kyoutoku grumbled in response, picking up his plate and heading back towards the kitchen. “It looks like I’m not the only one that’s going to miss Izuku when internships start,” Kyouka joked.

Mika faked a gasp and called into the kitchen, "Oh no! Honey, I don't think our Kyouka is going to survive being separated from Midoriya for a week!"

Kyoutoku came back out and sat back down, “A week? My god, when’s the last time she was away from him for more than an hour?”

Kyouka rolled her eyes, "Very funny, but I think I can survive a single week away from him."

Mika laughed, "Well, let's see. You haven't seen him in what? Two hours? Do you miss him already?"

"...I'm not answering that."

"You basically just did." Kyouka deadpanned at her mother before continuing to eat in silence. “I’m only messing with you, Kyouka. How many requests did you two get, anyway?”

Kyouka furrowed her brow, trying to recall the exact numbers, “I got one-thousand twelve, and Izuku got three-thousand eight-hundred ninety-one, if I remember that right.” 

Kyoutoku spat out his water, “Holy shit! What?!” 

“Wow,” Mika said excitedly, “that’s incredible!” Both parents got out of their seats, both trying to hug their daughter.

“Ah, it’s not a big deal! Mmph!” She was squished between her parents, growling as her jacks flared in anger. But, Mika’s jacks wrapped around her’s and pinned them. “Mm…”

Mika kissed the top of Kyouka’s head, “We’re so proud of you.”

“Yes, I’m well aware, as you’ve told me constantly since I came home from the festival,” Kyouka grumbled with a blush.

“Pretending to be tough when you’re actually just a big softie. You really are your father’s daughter.”

“Hey!”/”Hey!” Father and daughter both exclaimed.

Mika chuckled, letting her daughter go and both parents returning to her seat. “So, who did you pick for your internship?”

Kyouka poked at her food, avoiding eye contact, “You know...a hero.”

Both adults looked at each other with a raised brow. Mika turned back to Kyouka, "You know we have the right to not let you go on this internship. One call to the school an-"

"Okay! I get it! Just...don't freak out. " Kyouka twirled her jack as she looked off to the side, "...All Might. It's not a big deal! Just...he liked my performance in the festival, is all. He said everyone likes the underdog and all that...Guys?" 

Mika had dropped her chopsticks and was staring at her daughter with eyes open wide.

Kyoutoku was passed out on the floor.

“I said don’t freak out!”

“Well what did you expect?!” Mika shouted back, picking her husband up off of the floor and back into his seat. “All Might is kind of a big deal. Literally the biggest deal.” She plugged her jack into Kyoutoku’s ear and vibrated, shocking him awake. 

Kyoutoku rubbed his ear and groaned, “Ugh, what happened?”

“Kyouka was chosen to intern under All Might.” 

Kyoutoku’s eyes rolled back as he passed out again. Mika once again shocked him awake, “All Might, Kyouka’s internship, stay awake.”

“Right! Right, sorry. Just...Wow. I mean, this is amazing!” 

Once she was certain her partner wouldn’t faint again, Mika sat back down. “What about Midoriya? You said he loves All Might, and with his quirk, along with the fact that you and him worked together in the festival, he had to have been offered.”

Kyouka nodded, "He was offered, but Izuku actually declined."

"Hilarious. So, when do you two leave?"

"No, I'm serious. It's just me."

"I am now convinced life is a simulation and this is a glitch."

Kyouka rolled her eyes, “All Might recommended him to his old teacher, so Izuku couldn’t pass that up. Oh, I should mention that you guys can’t mention this to anyone. Neither Izuku’s internship nor mine.”

Kyouktoku frowned, “So my daughter was hand picked by the number one hero, the God-damn Symbol of Peace, to be trained by, and I don’t even get bragging rights?”

“That’s correct.”

“I don’t know what else I was expecting.”

*\*Knock Knock\**

Kyouka quickly got up from her seat and headed towards the door, “And, once again, my boyfriend saves me from my parents.” Kyouka opened the door, smiling at the sight of Izuku waiting on the other side. “At this point we should just get you a key.”

“I don’t think your dad would like that.”

“You’re damn right I wouldn’t!” Kyoutoku called out from the dinner table.

Izuku walked inside, bowing to both parents, “Good evening, Mr and Mrs. Jirou.”

Kyoutoku sighed, but chuckled to himself, “Hey, kid.”

Mika smiled at Izuku, motioning towards one of the empty chairs at the table, “Well, if it isn’t Mr. Three-thousand Requests. Are you hungry? There’s plenty left. You can have some before Kyouka steals you away for the evening.”

Blushing at the nickname, Izuku shook his head, “O-Oh, no thank you. I already ate.

Kyouka scoffed, “Excuse me, but I can’t steal what’s mine. Now, c’mon, Izuku. We missed out on training today, we need to make up for it..”

Kyoutoku made a face of disgust, “Training  isn’t some sort of euphemism, is it?”

Kyouka pointed at her father, an intense look in her eyes, “Not another word!” She fled up the steps for Izuku to follow her, not before waving to her parents with a shaky smile. But, before Izuku could get to the upper landing, he was stopped. 

“Hey.” Izuku paused on the steps, turning around to see Kyoutoku looking up at him. “You doing okay, kid?”

“Uh...Y-Yeah, I’m fine. Great, even.” 

Kyoutoku nodded, “Okay, good. That was it, I won’t keep you.” Izuku paused as he processed what had just happened, but he couldn’t deny how nice it felt. “Also, don’t go up there and make out with my daughter. You can lie, it’s just to make me feel better.”

“I-...I won’t,” Izuku lied.

“Good.” Kyoutoku walked back into the kitchen, standing next to his wife to help with the dishes. 

Mika placed a jack under his chin, leading him into a kiss, “My family of softies.”

Kyoutoku rolled his eyes, a slight blush tinting his cheeks, “I like the kid, so what?”

“Ah, and he finally admits it to himself.”

“Yeah, well...It’s not like it wasn’t obvious at this point. I can’t keep the act up forever. I’m still going to scare him from time-to-time.”

“I’d be worried if you didn’t,” Mika chuckled, “I’d suggest doing it before we go on our trip this summer.”

Kyoutoku furrowed his brow, “Why?”

“Kyouka will be home alone for a whole week, where she’ll no doubt invite Midoriya over whenever she wants. Not that she doesn’t do that anyway, but they’ll have the house to themselves.” Mika chuckled, expecting some kind of response from her husband, but she was met with silence. She turned to him, finding Kyoutoku with wide eyes. “...You didn’t think about that, did you?”

Kyoutoku closed his eyes, and took a long, deep breath. “...No. No, I did not.”

  
  

…..

**(1 Hour Later: Dagobah Municipal Beach Park)**

“You know,” Izuku grunted out as he did another push up, “this won’t be nearly as fun for you the day you’re ready for our roles to be switched.”

Kyouka scoffed from her position of lying on Izuku’s back as she looked up at the now purple sky and the first few stars of the night, “That’s not fair, you’re like ninety-percent muscle, and you’re taller than me. You’re at one-hundred, by the way.” Izuku flopped onto the mat they had laid out over the sand , groaning in relief. Kyouka rolled off of Izuku, kissing his head before he rolled onto his back, “Tomorrow is our rest day, so we’ll be back on schedule.” Laying her head on Izuku’s shoulder, Kyouka sighed as she took in his warmth, “A whole week without this…”

Izuku chuckled, “How are you somehow taking this worse than me? You were the one that was doing good before we met. I was, and still kind of am, a train wreck. It’s only one week.”

“Well, if you haven’t noticed, I like having you around and have had you around everyday for the last four months. And, in those few months, you somehow wooed me into entering a relationship with you. Forgive me if I’ve grown attached.” Kyouka didn’t want to think about the fact that it meant leaving her main source of comfort behind. She would just have to make sure to pack Izuku’s jacket for the trip.

“I understand. I feel the same,” Izuku nodded. “But, I’m sure it’ll be good to go off on our own, just for a little bit. The last thing I want is for you to get sick of me.”

“If I get sick of you, get me to a mental hospital as quickly as you can.” They both had a small laugh as they continued to relax in the rising sun, the early morning chill causing them to stay huddled together. “Are you still nervous about Gran Torino?”

“A-A little, but I can’t help but be excited, too. No matter how rough or mean he is, he was All Might’s teacher. He’s one of the people who helped in the creation of my hero. N-Not including you, of course. You’re obviously my true hero.”

“Nice save,” Kyouka laughed. “Not that I think I deserve that title, but...thanks. You’re my hero, too, even with all the cheesy lines you feed me.”

“At this point I’d say it’s a staple of our relationship. But, what about you? I can say from experience that training with All Might is rough, but I have no idea what he has in store for your internship.

“I’m still not convinced I was the one he should have picked, but it’s not like I can say no now. It’ll definitely be a new experience, that’s for sure. Maybe he’ll teach me something that will actually make me useful when All For One comes knocking on your door.”

Breathing deep, Izuku rested his cheek on top of Kyouka’s head, “Let’s hope All Might is wrong and it never comes to that. And, if it does, let's hope we’ll be older, more experienced, and the best Hero Duo in Japan. So much so that All For One just gives up.” 

“Hmhm, still sticking to that hero duo idea?”

“Y-Yeah, do...Did you change your mind?”

“No! No, no, not at all.” Kyouka smiled, her cheeks turning slightly red, “...I just like hearing you say it, that’s all. I can’t wait.”

“Me too. Actually, that reminds me, there’s something I wanted to ask you. I know we want to keep our relationship private for the time being, that’s not going to change. I was just wondering...W-Well, if we’re really serious about our futures of being heroes together, being a duo, sharing an agency, all of that...Should we at least tell Mr. Aizawa? Having him know could really help us down the line.”

Kyouka hummed to herself in thought, “I guess it would be important to know your two students are aiming for a specific path. He might even pair us up more for assignments and training. The only downside is…”

Izuku laughed, immediately knowing what Kyouka was going to say, “It means telling someone about us, and we already have four people who know, which is four more than we intended when we first started going out.”

“Exactly. I know it’s not actually that big of a deal, but...I dunno.”

“I know, I feel the same,” Izuku sighed. It wasn’t like Aizawa would or even could interfere with their relationship. It’s not like he cared anyway. But, when entering a life-threatening profession, or a profession where corruption is very possible, it’s usually important to disclose when a personal relationship was formed. And, Kyouka was right. There were likely a lot of situations where they would want to be paired together to learn how to operate as a unit. Especially since superpowered punches and soundwaves weren’t exactly the most seamless combination. “We can just sit on it for now. We’ll wait until after the internships to make a decision.”

“Sounds perfect to me. I’m already nervous about Aizawa constantly keeping an eye on you, and now on me, about this whole All Might thing. I’d like to spend this week together in peace.”

Izuku rubbed Kyouka’s shoulder, mustering up the confidence to say with a shaky voice, “Th-Then let’s make this week count.”

Kyouka propped herself up over him, a sly smirk growing on her lips, “Izuku Midoriya, are you implying what I think you’re implying? If you are, I’m surprised at how forward you’re becoming.”

“E-Ever since the festival, I’ve just been...really, *really* happy. And it’s because of you, so I guess I want to make it up to you.”

Kyouka blushed, leaning down to press her forehead against Izuku’s, “When’s the last train?

“Do we really care?”

“Not really.” Their lips met, their arms wrapping snugly around each other. After a few minutes of soft kisses, they gradually escalated, applying more pressure. Kyouka gave the slightest hint of tongue, asking permission for entrance. Izuku quickly obliged, their tongues swirling together in a dance. Kyouka slid her leg over Izuku’s stomach, straddling him as he sat up, impatient to meet her lips again. 

It was almost worrying how quickly their new intimacy became addicting. Of course, that was in part due to hormones, but they couldn’t deny the sensation and presence each felt from their partner was a big part of it. 

Kyouka bit Izuku’s lip, pulling Izuku with her as she leaned back. They both giggled, pressing their noses together. 

Ever since their first real advancement in their intimacy a few nights ago with french kissing, new boundaries had yet to be set. The gates of simple kisses had been opened, and now a new standard needed to be put in place so they knew how far they were willing to go for the time being.

Of course, they didn’t want to get carried away. Things still needed to remain simple, but it was important to know what level their intimacy was at now.

Kyouka tried to think of what the most appropriate limit to test would be, and she settled on one. 

“Can I try something?” she asked timidly.

Izuku’s eyebrows raised, but he nodded, “S-Sure.”

Kyouka smiled warmly, pecking his lips, and then she began trailing kisses from Izuku’s cheek and down to his jawline. “I want you to tell me how this feels.”

Kyouka moved down to Izuku’s neck, kissing just at his pulse point. She nipped his skin in a few places before continuing to different areas of Izuku’s neck and collar. Izuku sighed with pleasure, threading his fingers through Kyouka’s hair, “That feels amazing.”

Kyouka hummed happily in response, not letting up on her actions. Izuku felt Kyouka kissing her way down his neck, the sand underneath giving them a comfortable cushion. They were gentle, soft kisses, each one being planted in a different spot. Besides her natural hesitance of doing something completely new to them, Kyouka was afraid of making a hickey.

...Mostly due to the fact that she didn’t know *how* to give a hickey, and didn’t want to do it by accident. 

All Kyouka knew was that the cliché hickey was usually on or near the neck. But, she was happy to hear Izuku’s quiet growl in his throat and heavy breathing, indicating she was doing a good job.

Izuku stroked Kyouka’s hair as she continued to kiss his neck. He quickly accepted kissing the neck as a new and very welcome addition to their usual romantic escapades. Kyouka had made her contribution to the night. She had taken a risk, and it paid off. Now, it was Izuku’ turn.

It was time to try something he had been holding off on doing long enough. 

“Can I try something, too?” Izuku asked. Kyouka only replied with a curt nod before returning to his neck. *'Please, please work.'* Izuku quickly picked up one of Kyouka's jacks, putting the end in his mouth, sucking and circling his tongue around it.

Kyouka's eyes went wide as she quit peppering Izuku’s neck with kisses and sat up straight, "Woah, the heck are you doi-...Oh...Ooh... *Ooh~."* Her eyelids lowered halfway, her mouth slightly parted. "How uh...Wow, how'd you know you can do this? I didn't even know."

"Uh…" Izuku replied, muffled by the jack still in his mouth. "...Just a good guess."

It honestly was just a good guess. He figured they were sensitive in certain ways, so...why not this

He released the jack, kissing the length of it all the way up to Kyouka’s ear, and then returning her earlier favor by placing small kisses on her neck. The heat between them was continuing to rise higher and higher, the evidence being a small moan sounding out from the back of Kyouka’s throat, causing both teens to freeze up. 

They looked at one another timidly. Izuku cleared his throat and chuckled nervously, “I-I guess we can safely say we like this.”

“Yeah…” Kyouka whispered under her breath with a deep blush. The moan had been involuntary, and she was a little embarrassed. But, she couldn’t deny it was natural. She was just thankful Izuku took it in stride. Kyouka wrapped her arms around Izuku’s neck, resting her head against his. Izuku returned the hug, his arms snaking around her waist. They sat in silence with Kyouka in Izuku’s lap, both with wide smiles on their faces. 

The ears and neck seemed to be the new limit, and that was perfect for them. It was a long road, and they were affirmatively still far away from talking about the elephant in the room. The elephant being what Kyouka could feel from Izuku pressing against the underside of her leg. Another involuntary thing that both would simply let be for the time being.

They had a set pace, and it was working. There was no need to rush. They were just elated that even with all of the stress life continued to throw at them, what they had together remained untarnish. They had found a way before, and they knew they would continue to do so.

Everything was falling into place.

**(One Week Later: Musutafu Mand’alor Central Train Station)**

  
  

“Does everyone have their costumes?” Once he saw all of his students nod in confirmation, Aizawa nodded his head towards the trains. “Alright, I trust you all to find your proper train lines. Be on your best behavior. Now go.” Shouta turned around to leave, but then pivoted back to point at his students. “And none of you embarrass me!” With that, he took his leave.

As the class began to disperse, Kyouka smirked, looking at her friends, “I don’t know about you guys, but I get the feeling he’s a *little* embarrassed by us.”

Momo rolled her eyes, “I’ve come to accept that fact.”

Ochako pumped her fists in the air, “Then we just gotta prove him wrong! Next time you guys see me, I’ll be a martial arts master!” 

Kyouka chuckled, “Easy, tiger. It’s just a week. But, I guess we could say the same for Yaoyorozu here.”

“I have no idea why Edgeshot chose me, but I intend to make the most of it,” Momo replied. “What about you and Midoriya? Training under someone who taught All Might’s class has to be exciting.”

Kyouka nudged Izuku with her elbow, “I’ll manage, but I don’t know about this guy. I might have to keep him from fanboying out every five seconds.”

“I’m not that bad,” Izuku deadpanned.

“I’ve seen your room, dude.”

“Don’t mention that!” Kyouka laughed, looking down at her row of friends to see Iida had stopped. 

“Everyone, I’m afraid this is where I leave you. This is my train. I’ll see you all in a week.”

“Wait, Iida!” Everyone was surprised that it was Izuku who called out to him “If...I-If...We’re here for you, Iida. Whenever you need us.” 

Everyone else nodded, backing Izuku up. Iida’s expression barely changed, that is, until he gave a small smile. “Of course. Thank you.” He turned around and boarded his train, leaving his friends behind.

Kyouka sighed, turning to Izuku, “Fake?”

Izuku nodded, “Fake. And, notice his train line’s next stop.”

Kyouka looked up at the electronic sign above the platform, her stomach dropping when it read, “Next Destination: Hosu”.

“You don’t think he’s going to try something stupid, do you?” Kyouka asked.

“I have faith in Iida’s intelligence, so I doubt it. But…”

Momo spoke up, “He’ll be under watch by his Pro, too. His chances of doing something as rash as what we’re implying is low.”

Ochako shrugged, but her face was one of worry and uneasiness, “Maybe he wants to see where it happened.”

Kyouka sighed, tugging Izuku’s sleeve, “We’ve gotta go. Our train leaves soon.” After saying their goodbyes to the other two, the couple began walking towards another platform. They saw Aizawa still spectating from a distance, waiting for all of his students to leave. He nodded at the two, a signal that he knew what was going on. 

To keep their cover, Izuku and Kyouka would board the same train, but would separate at the next station. They found their train, entering and finding seats. As the train began leaving the station, Kyouka saw Momo talking to Itsuka Kendo from Class 1-B, and they boarded the same train. Kyouka chalked it up to coincidence.

  
  

…..

**(30 Minutes Later: Outskirts of Musutafu)**

Izuku and Kyouka both exited the train, turning to one another as they knew it was time to part ways.

Kyouka sighed, “...One week?”

Izuku nodded, rubbing the back of his neck with a somber smile, “One week.”

“...You’re going to call me as soon as you get there, right?”

Izuku nodded, “Of course.” After making sure no one was paying attention to them, their lips met for a deep kiss. After a few more pecks, they hesitantly separated. “I’ll miss you.”

“I’ll miss you, too.” 

With that, they both walked away towards their respective trains.

**(1 Hour Later: Musutafu Suburban Area)**

  
  

“Wait, you’ve never been to All Might’s place?”

*“No, he never took me there,”* Izuku responded over the phone. *“Never really needed to, I guess. We’ve always just met at Dagobah. What’s it like?”*

“It’s very…” Kyouka looked up and down at the two story modern house up and down. There was a minimal, but well kept garden, and gray walls. “...dull. Isn’t he supposed to be rich? I mean, I get money isn’t the main priority here. But, number one hero money is still, ya know, *number one hero money* .”

*“Well, his identity isn’t known to the public. People who do know could be dangerous, so he needs to be discreet. A house like that doesn’t draw attention. It’s gotta be better than Gran Torino’s house.”*

“Really?”

*“Y-Yeah, I’m outside right now. And uh...I’m concerned I’m at the wrong house. I might be at a drug lab.”*

Kyouka chuckled at the thought, “Well, if you are in fact at a drug lab, then you can show your stuff early by stopping a crime.”

*“Maybe, but it would be vigilantism."*

"Even in imminent danger?"

*"Pretty much."*

"That's a stupid law."

*"Yet we chose the career path that enforces it."*

"Don't you sass me with logic. That's my role in the relationship."

Izuku laughed from the other end, *"Well, I should get inside. Don't want to keep him waiting."*

"Alright, don't get killed if it actually is a drug lab. I like having you around. Call me tonight?"

*"Of course. Bye."*

"Later." Hanging up, Kyouka picked up her bag and walked to the front door. She rang the doorbell and waited. Soon footsteps could be heard, and the door swung open to reveal All Might…

...Wearing a large, fluffy, American flag themed robe.

*'Discreet...Yeah right, Izuku.'*

Toshinori's eyes widened as he saw who was at his door. "Oh, uh...The internship was today?"

Kyouka deadpanned, looking up and down at Toshinori's fluffy American flag robe. "...Yeah."

"...Riiight...Well, clearly I still need to freshen up, hehe. Please, come in. I’ll be down in a second so we can leave." 

Kyouka awkwardly stepped inside, Toshinori closing the door behind her. "You know, for trying to be discreet and blending with the gray house and all, the robe is pretty obvious."

Toshinori raised a brow, "What does my house have to do with blending in?"

"...Wow."

"I just like it here. I don't need some big penthouse or anything. I find being comfortable more important than being luxurious."

Kyouka turned to the right, her brows raising a bit. "...And the massive television?"

Toshinori pursed his lips as he turned towards his living room to look at his flatscreen television covering most of the far wall from top to bottom. "I'm an American movie buff. I can indulge in luxury *sometimes* ."

"...Does that robe have gold embroidery?"

"Moving on! I'll be right back, you make yourself at home. We'll leave for Tokyo in a bit. Help yourself to anything in the fridge." Toshinori walked up the steps, leaving Kyouka to view the rest of the house.

It was fairly standard. Dining room through an archway to the right, living room down one step to the left with some space and a kitchen through a door in the back. A few windows, souvenirs, and trinkets were scattered on the walls. Clearly American, but nothing to give away his identity. The rosewood floors and muted blue walls also added to the little theme Toshinori had going on. 

Kyouka took the step down into the living area, setting her bags behind the large couch. As plain as it all was, she couldn't help but imagine Izuku still nerding out over it simply because it was the home of All Might. 

She took notice of the lack of pictures on the walls. She had to assume because of how Toshinori looked in the past, contrasting with how he looked now. If someone had to be there, they would question what happened to him. There was one picture, however, on a dresser against the stairway. Kyouka walked up to it, picking it up to see a beautiful woman next to a young All Might in the photo. Long black hair let down, but with a bun at the back, storm gray eyes, and while it was a bit difficult to tell through the clothing she was wearing, a very athletically built yet curvy body.

She didn't look anything like Toshinori, but perhaps it was his mother? That seemed unlikely with Toshinori’s experience with his awful parents. Maybe it was the previous wielder that they had mentioned in the faculty office last week? He looked pretty young in the picture, but was All Might ever married? The woman definitely looked older, but she was fairly young looking, too. That kind of information was never released to the public, as All Might's personal life was a complete mystery. 

Besides the limited information Izuku shared with her at the beach. But, that was all Izuku knew. He was still in the dark about All Might’s past as well. 

Kyouka wouldn't pry, but it was interesting to learn new things about the number one hero nobody else knew. 

“Sorry about that,” Toshinori said as he made it to the ground floor, a duffel bag and suitcase in his hands. “Becoming a teacher has oddly made my ability to keep track of time worse. School days make everything blend together for me sometimes.”

“It’s cool.”

“Well, we should...Oh.” He noticed the picture Kyouka was looking at, putting his suitcase down and walking over to her. “That’s...That’s my master. You’ve heard Young Midoriya and I mention her before.”

“Ah, that was one of my first guesses. What was she like?”

Toshinori chuckled, picking his suitcase up again, “Another time, perhaps. C’mon, we don’t want to miss our train. We have a full week planned out, and the last thing we need is any unnecessary setbacks or surprises.”

“At this point we should just expect it. When does anything ever turn out as expected for us?”

“Well, we know one thing for sure,” Toshinori said, turning the doorknob, “...this is going to be interesting.”
