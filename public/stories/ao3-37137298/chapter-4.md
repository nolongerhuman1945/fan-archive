The first week after Izuku and Kyoka had moved into the farm was something of a learning experience for the two. While the book gifted by Demetrius was a great help, reading about crop rotation and how to till soil did little to prepare one for the actual experience that was running a farm. Neither one was about to let a little problem like “inexperience” stop them however, U.A. pushed the motto of “Plus Ultra” after all, and the two certainly had enough motivation to make up the difference.

After the land was cleared and all the crops planted, the Heroes found themselves with ample time on their hands. While Izuku searched for an area that would be better suited for training his Quirk, Kyoka decided to explore the town to familiarize herself. The excursion was short, Pelican Town was a far cry from a metropolis like Tokyo, but right before Kyoka made for the mountains to see how Izuku was fairing, she stumbled upon a dilapidated building next to a small park. Lewis stood out front, with a dejected look on his face.

Once filled with activity, the Community Center now sat abandoned and forgotten, an eyesore of an otherwise idyllic town. Lewis had received some offers to purchase the building from the local JojaMart representative Morris, but he had turned them all down. Out of curiosity, Kyoka asked the mayor for a look inside, and found the inside to be even worse off. A broken fish tank had leaked water everywhere, causing large areas of the wooden floor to have rotted away. Vegetation grew through the exposed dirt and cracks in the wall, and the supports seemed keen to give way at a moment’s notice.

Even stranger, an odd stone hut with a roof of leaves sat in the corner, which Lewis chalked up to the work of Vincent and Jas. Kyoka had her doubts, even though she met the two only in passing, she didn’t peg either of them to have the patience to build the small hut. As the mayor left, Kyoka decided to explore the rest of the building, hoping to find a better explanation for the mysterious hut. Most of the rooms had nothing new, but what was once a crafts room contained a golden tablet that seemed to be recently placed, and on it a language Kyoka had never seen before.

After looking over the strange tablet and finding nothing else noteworthy, Kyoka turned to leave. While she thought of the best person or place to find more on the oddity, out of the corner of her eye she saw something bright green and small move, but upon turning to get a better look it had vanished. She doubted it was a rat due to its coloration (although a voice that sounded *suspiciously* like Izuku said that rat’s might be green in this world), and despite her best efforts, Kyoka could not find another one of the little creatures in the old Community Center.

By the time she abandoned her search, the day had nearly come to an end, and after a simple dinner both farmers went to bed early to get a head start on their work tomorrow, while Kyoka decided to get more answers about the strange happenings in the Community Center.

* * *

“Hey Kyoka, do you know why a wizard is sending us mail about a ‘rat problem?’”

Or it seems answers will come to her. After a brief recounting of her time in the old building, Izuku was left just as confused as Kyoka was, and decided to accompany her to visit Rasmodius. The morning passed quickly, both farmers working to finish their daily chores as fast as possible. Soon the two were finished and passed the short walk through the forest in a comfortable silence. The residence of the Wizard was easy to spot, the large stone tower rising high above the tree line, and before long the farmers found themselves standing in front of the entrance.

After a knock on the door with no response, Kyoka tested the handle and found the door unlocked. Izuku voiced a concern to simply come back some other time, not wishing to be cursed for coming in uninvited.

“Well, he did invite us, and if he didn’t want people to come inside, he shouldn’t have left the door unlocked.” While Izuku couldn’t find a fault in her words, they did little to sooth the growing fear he would be spending the rest of his life as a frog, or other such creature.

“She is right about my invitation.” The words broke Izuku out of his thoughts before he cursed himself for muttering out loud. The man in front of them looked the part of a wizard, wearing long robes decorated with odd talismans. The only part that seemed off was an odd cowboy hat of black leather with a purple band. Izuku kept his thoughts on the Wizard’s choice in headgear to himself.

Rasmodius stirred a large cauldron with bubbling green liquid inside before he continued to speak, “Besides, I wouldn’t waste the resources necessary for transmutation on a simple home invader. Far too costly.”

Deciding to ignore his comment, Kyoka decided to jump right to the topic of his letter, the ‘rat problem’ in the community center. “Ah, yes. The creature you saw that day was actually a type of forest spirit called a ‘Junimo.’” Rasmodius continued his lesson on the small creatures without breaking focus on his brew. “They have inhabited the forest surrounding the town from the time before the town was built. With the abandonment of the Community Center allowing nature to reclaim the building, the Junimo’s have likely decided to ‘move in’. They find abandoned settlements fascinating.”

After whipping out a notebook (with such speed even Rasmodius was briefly shocked from his task) Izuku recorded all the Wizard told him, hoping to take back knowledge of the fascinating practices and creatures if *when* he and Kyoka returned to Japan. “Well, it’s a shame we can’t help rebuild the Center without displacing them. It’s not like they did anything wrong, the Junimo’s just found an interesting place to live…”

“Not so,” Rasmodius interrupted, while pouring his concoction into two cups. “Did you happen to find a form of golden scroll or tablet in the building?” Kyoka nodded in confirmation. “Those are the Junimo’s way of asking for assistance. If you decide to help them with their requests, the Junimo’s are likely to repay in kind. This is actually the reason why I have called you here. By helping the Junimo’s they will provide their assistance to the town in a form of symbiosis. The only problem being few alive can claim to understand their language.” Rasmodius handed both cups to the two farmers. “This potion will allow you to speak their language. I cannot force you to help them, I merely ask that you consider doing so.”

After some deliberation, Kyoka down her cup. The liquid was thick and viscous, the taste reminding her of a mix of pine tar and fresh grass. Soon her vision was filled with nothing but the color green and natural flora, and her skull felt like it was about to burst from the knowledge being forced inside.

While Kyoka was having a bad trip, Izuku had set his cup down to continue his writing. The idea of a potion that could be used to learn a language was fascinating, and his mind shot forth with a myriad of questions on the possibilities. Would it work with all languages or only those of ‘magical’ beings? Could any knowledge be passed down? Did the person making the potion have to know the information before hand? Was the information permanent or could it be forgotten? Did…

His writing was interrupted by Rasmodius grabbing his scarred, crooked right hand while looking it over. “To gain such injuries despite being so young… may I ask how you injured yourself to this degree?”

“O-oh… well it was sort of a couple incidents combined… I was competing in a festival tournament, and my opponent, Todoroki, well… I can’t really tell the specifics, It’s not my place too. He was trying to prove a point to someone, but he was only hurting himself. I managed to convince him during our fight, but in the end, I needed some intense surgery in my hand. The second time was when a serial killer tried to murder a boy. I managed to stop him, but my arm was broken so severely that I have permanent ligament damage. Any more breaks and I could lose function completely.” Rasmodius carefully inspected the boy’s face during his story but did not find the slightest bit of deceit. To sacrifice his own safety for not only the life but mental well-being of others was admirable. Rasmodius considered his next actions after seeing the state of his arm, but hearing his tale erased any doubt in his mind.

The Wizard picked up Izuku’s cup, causing some concern in the boy who thought he did something wrong. Instead of cursing him or loudly shouting to leave while blasting him with magic, as all angry wizards did, instead Rasmodius took a minute to find some more potion ingredients. After some time preparing and adding the strange collection of herbs and fungi he gathered, the potion in Izuku’s cup was now a faint pink compared to the forest green it was. “This should help with your arm as well as let you understand the Junimo’s. Drink it quickly however, the potion goes bad quickly.”

With a quick ‘itadakimasu’, Izuku downed the potion, only to find the Wizard quickly forcing a strip of leather into his mouth. Before he could begin to question the reason for this, an effect similar to the one Kyoka experienced started to take hold, only for the dancing visions and pounding skull to be instantly replaced with the sheer agony that consumed his arm. Clutching the limb to his chest, Izuku could feel the bones in his hand forcefully rearrange themselves and felt the combined pain of all the previous breaks in his arm hit at once. Finally, the universe decided to give a faint mercy to the boy, and Izuku’s consciousness faded.

He awoke sometime later to find himself on his back and kneeling beside him a concerned Kyoka, who immediately wrapped him into a hug. “I didn’t expect you to awake for a few hours more.” Izuku turned his head to see the Wizard, standing from what looked like a spot for meditation. “My apologies for not telling you the pain the potion would cause, but I have found even with warning no one truly grasps the repercussions. The more damage one receives, the more pain one must endure. Your injuries were right on the threshold where the potion would do more harm than good.”

Izuku was left with mixed feelings about the experience. Pain was too weak a word for the suffering he had felt, but now that he had recovered, he felt... fine. No, even better than fine, the phantom aches in his arm he had long grown accustomed too had completely vanished, the scaring in his arm was completely gone. Even the smaller aches from past injuries on other parts of his body had simply disappeared without a trace.

“W-well, thanks… I guess. For fixing my arm,” Izuku said while shifting his body to sit up, oblivious to the now blushing girl by his side. “But why did you help in the first place…” The Wizard gave a small smile, “Consider it an incentive to carry out my request in aiding the Junimo’s.”

The two thanked Rasmodius for his assistance, even if Kyoka did say she would ‘vibrate him so hard he would liquify’ if he ever did such a stunt again, to which the Wizard only gave a small chuckle.

The farmers walked back to their property, while Izuku flexed and felt his arm in amazement. In truth Izuku was already on board to help the forest spirits, he wouldn’t be a good Hero otherwise, but he wouldn’t turn down having his body restored to peak condition. Even with the ‘repercussions’.

Kyoka was busy piecing together the little information she heard while the effects of the potion wore off her. All of her class could tell Izuku and Todoroki were having much more than a simple tournament fight during the Sports Festival. Knowing that the heterochromatic boy didn’t use his fire out of desperation, but because Izuku managed to save him from whatever bitterness was consuming him… well knowing Izuku, it wasn’t really a surprise.

After a day filled with lectures on magical creatures and potion induced blackouts, the farmer duo retired for the night, deciding to check the abandoned Community Center tomorrow.

* * *

“Come on Kyoka, I finally found the perfect place to train our Quirks!”

Izuku’s excitement was always a welcome sight for Kyoka, but she would rather such excitement come sometime in the PM. Or at least after 8AM.

Outside the sky was covered in clouds with rain pouring down. With the weather taking care of irrigation for the day, and no plants needing to be harvested, Izuku elected to explore the surrounding area while Kyoka got some much welcome sleep, before the green haired farmer ran in to the house shortly after he left, almost earning him a jack in the neck for his trouble.

Izuku wouldn’t listen to such responses as ‘Please let me sleep’ and ‘I’m sure the spot will still be there tomorrow’, and so Kyoka found herself headed to the mountains in the morning while being drenched from the rain.

“I still don’t know why we can’t just practice in the mines. That place has actual *things* to fight.” Plus, the ores and gem stones they found were rather profitable, as despite going onto their third week of farming, they had made quite a profit from their finds.

“I mean I did consider it, but well…”

* * *

*Izuku slammed a fist into a cave bat that attempted to swoop down on him from above, sending it careening into the cavern as it’s death cries echoed off the walls. Quickly sidestepping a mole like creature that attempted to burrow up from under him, Izuku grabbed and yanked it from the ground before throwing it at a giant flying insect, both dying upon impact. Behind him, Kyoka had two slimes in front of her and jabbed a jack into each, before pumping enough of her heartbeat that the gelatinous monsters were reduced to stains on the walls.*

* * *

“The monsters there aren’t really that difficult. Plus, if I use to much of my Quirk or you’re too intense with your vibrations, we might risk a cave in.” Kyoka had to concede both points, as their training to become Heroes was much more intense than anything they had faced in the mines so far, and dying from being crushed alive sounded like a poor way to go.

The two walked further into the mountains, passing the large mountaintop lake and the entrance to the mines. Soon Izuku had led Kyoka to a broken bridge past the east side of the lake, beyond which resided an old stone quarry. “This is the spot!” Izuku exclaimed with a wide smile on his face.

“So, you got me up and dragged me through the rain because you just *had* to show me an old quarry?”

“Yep!” The boy responded oblivious to the sarcasm in her voice. “It’s perfect, I can practice using more of my Quirk to carry and break stone, and you can practice breaking denser materials with your vibrations! Plus, I’m pretty sure I saw some ore deposits and gemstones too, so we’re still making a profit while training.”

Kyoka had to admit the location was a good one, well suited to training both their skill sets. But there was one small problem that Izuku seemed to miss. “The bridge is out.”

In lieu of a response, Izuku simply charged up One for All, picked up Kyoka bridal style, and leaped across the broken bridge in a single bound. At first shaken from the sudden action, Kyoka jabbed a jack into his neck while hoping that Izuku didn’t notice the blush that had spread across her face.

“Alright smartass, next time at least warn me before you do that.” Despite her tone, Kyoka didn’t mind his actions. And it seemed from the small laugh he gave while rubbing his neck, neither did Izuku.

* * *

“Ugh, remind me why I let you drag me to this.” Sebastian was far from his element. He preferred the confines of his room where he worked as a freelance programmer, or spending time with Sam and Abigail, the two people he felt closest with in town. He absolutely did not enjoy the uncomfortable suit and forced social interaction that came with the Flower Dance, the absolute worst town festival (in Sebastian’s humble opinion.)

“Because you wanted to see if Sam asked Penny to dance ‘as a friend’ yet again?” Abigail stood next to him, clearly as uncomfortable with the traditional white dress as Sebastian was with his attire. “Seriously literally everyone can tell he likes her except for themselves. It’s infuriating sometimes.” A notion Sebastian readily agreed with. There couldn’t be a pair more oblivious to how they really felt then those two. Only for his inner dialog to be corrected as the two new farmers arrived at the event grounds.

Kyoka and Izuku were cool to hang out with, separately at least. Kyoka was impressive when it came to musical talent and a good instructor. After less than a month of practicing, the three-man band had improved so much the difference was night and day. Izuku was a bundle of nerves on a good day, but somehow this worked in his favor to make him endearing in a way. It didn’t hurt he was surprisingly good at *Solarion Chronicles: The Game* either*.* But together…

The constant poorly hidden blushes and not-so-sneaky glances whenever they had to occupy space within five feet of each other left Sebastian honestly amazed at how long the two could go without one realizing their feelings were reciprocated. It felt a little hypocritical, as it took Sebastian and Abigail a week of constant dancing around the other to finally do something about their own feelings, but this trainwreck between the farmers had been going on for nearly a month.

It had seemed as though Abigail had similar thoughts, and decided it was time to take matters into her own hands, “Hey Seb. I think I have a plan to help those two out.” Sebastian groaned both at the uncreative pet name and the prospect of more social interaction, but still agreed to her plan. If it got those two to stop with the ‘shy, blushing schoolgirl’ acts, then it was worth it.

* * *

“Hey guys!” Izuku and Kyoka looked over to see Abigail and Sebastian, wearing a dress and blue suit that clearly neither were comfortable with. “Did you come to join the dance today or just come to watch?” Truth be told neither had an idea of what the festival entailed. The Egg Festival was similar quite similar to Easter with decorated eggs and egg scavenger hunts, but neither wanted to make assumptions, as beyond something to do with flowers and dancing, there was a lot of room for interpretation.

“No, we just decided to hang back and see what it’s like. Neither of us really knew what to expect today.” Said Kyoka. “Plus, I doubt you would be able to get me in one of those dresses.” The two purple haired girls shared a laugh, before Abigail gave a look to Sebastian and started to work her plan.

“Well even if you aren’t part of the main dance, are you still going to dance together? I know a lot of the couples in town use today as an excuse to be all romantic together.” Her words had their intended effect as both Izuku and Kyoka felt a blush creep over their faces and made to deny their involvement.

“I-I’m not… I mean… what gave… w-we’re not together!”/“I d-don’t know what… he’s… I’m not dating him!”

Sebastian took this as his que to speak up, “Oh? I could have sworn you two were dating.” Izuku started to frantically wave his hands while denying such claims, while Kyoka had completely frozen up with the exception of her earjacks, which were currently spazzing out in random directions. It took nearly 15 seconds for Izuku to manage to form a coherent sentence, “W-w-well we’re n-not!” before trying desperately to find anything to do that wasn’t continuing this conversation.

“So if one of you wanted to go out you wouldn’t say yes?” The sadistic grin on her face went unnoticed by the oblivious pair, but Sebastian felt a shiver go down his spine. His girlfriend could be scary sometimes.

“W-well I-I mean I would be honored, but you can’t s-seriously think someone as g-great as Kyoka w-would…”/“L-look… Izuku is great and all, b-but he’d n-never feel that way about s-someone like…”

Silence overtook the two as they both struggled to comprehend what they had both heard. Izuku’s mouth stilled while his mind raced a mile a minute. *‘She… thinks I’m great? But why wouldn’t I want to d-date someone like her, she’s amazing and talented and… and I’m just… me.’* Kyoka did not fair much better. *‘He would be honored? But all the girls in the class would go out with him if he asked. Hell, half the girls in school look at him like he’s the next coming of All Might… and he likes… me?’*

While Izuku and Kyoka simply gawked at each other in a mixture of confusion, amazement and elation, Abigail felt it was time to leave to two alone. “Well now we won’t have to deal with those two shying around each other all the time. Good thing they weren’t as dense as Sam.” Sebastian agreed that it would be a welcome change, before a terrible thought occurred. “I don’t think we thought this through all the way.”

Abigail stopped to look at him in confusion, “What do you mean, clearly my plan worked.”

Sebastian shook his head, “It’s not the plan that’s concerning me.” The dark-haired boy looked to Abigail with a grave, almost fearful expression. “What if they’re one of those super mushy couples that do *everything* together.”

“Oh. Oh no.”

* * *

Izuku and Kyoka had decided to leave the festival early, deciding a public venue would not be the right place for the conversation they needed to have. As the two walked back to the farm, they decided the pier extending into the forest lake was private enough.

As they sat down, neither one still dared to look at the other directly or speak up, insecurities flaring up to make both think the whole situation was some elaborate prank. Eventually after what felt like hours of sitting in silence, Izuku spoke up. “Did… you really mean what you said back there?”

“Yeah. Did… did you?”

“Yes.” A new wave of silence overtook the two, only for Kyoka to speak up first. “Why me?” Out of all the questions that could have been asked, this was one he didn’t expect. “What do you mean?”

“I mean out of all the girls in the class, hell all the girls in school, any one of them would jump at the chance to go out with you. Ochako isn’t even subtle about how much she likes you, so why do you think I’m so great? I’m just the flat chested, tomboy who likes music. Even Toru get’s more attention from the guys and she’s invisible! I just can’t understand why…”

Kyoka’s self-loathing filled rant was interrupted by Izuku grabbing her hand. “Kyoka, please look at me.” After wiping tears she didn’t realize were forming, she lifted her gaze up at the verdanette. “First of all, you’re one of the most attractive girls I’ve ever met. I don’t care if every single guy in the world or even you disagree with me, I think you’re beautiful.” The earnestness in Izuku’s voice made Kyoka’s heart nearly burst from her chest and her stomach twist into knots, but he kept going. “You’re not just ‘the music girl’, you’re an amazing Hero, and the coolest person I’ve met. Anyone would be lucky to be with you. I just don’t know what I did to make you feel that way about me…”

It baffled Kyoka how a guy as great as Izuku could say in one breath how much he was amazed by her only to put himself down in the next, and she didn’t like that attitude coming from his mouth. So, she decided to do something about it. “Izuku, you are the most heroic guy at U.A. You’re not only one of the best in class, but you’re constantly helping everyone with their work. You risked your life to save that kid from Muscular at the summer camp, and you saved Todoroki from whatever was eating at him. Hell, you even managed to make Bakugou respect you. Even if only barely.” A small laugh left Izuku’s lips. Kyoka could listen to it forever, but she had to finish her point. “Even before we got to know each other better, I don’t think there is any other guy in class I would rather have been sent here with. And…and if getting hit with some weird Quirk is what it took to finally realize how much I love you, then I don’t mind.”

Kyoka was just as surprised at the word ‘love’ coming from her mouth as the man in front of her, but she didn’t feel any other word would do what she felt for Izuku justice. “I… I’m glad you fell the same way Kyoka. I love you too.” Neither of the two would remember who it was that moved in first, but both remember what happened after. As Kyoka and Izuku’s lips met, the faint sound of the forest faded away and for a few brief, wonderful seconds, the only thing that existed to the couple was each other. It wasn’t a deep kiss, or a particularly long one, but it was enough for them. The two separated, before spending the rest of the day holding each other on the small pier, lost to their own little world.

They didn’t know how long their time in Pelican Town would be, but they would forever be grateful for what it brought.

“Attention, classmates! Midnight-sensei has just informed me that she has identified the Quirk Midoriya and Jiro were affected by.” Iida’s words grabbed the attention of the rest of class 1-A. While everyone kept their nerves during the incident, the class couldn’t help but worry now that there was no active threat. After arriving back at the dorms, Iida was pulled aside by Midnight to inform him about the details of the situation and tasking the class representative with keeping the class calm. “The Quirk has a duration of 5 hours, after which the two will be returned to the spot they had vanished from.”

The news was a great relief for the class, with Izuku’s closely knit friend group in particular breathing a heavy sigh of relief. “I have also been informed that Midoriya and Jiro’s family will be brought to the dorms to await their return with us. As such, we must show them the high standard to which we at U.A. hold ourselves. I have organized a cleaning list to be…”

As Iida attempted to coral the class into cleaning the dorms top to bottom, class 1-A’s resident acid girl, Ashido Mina couldn’t help but feel… off. Normally, she had a sixth sense for romance that she used to attempt to get her classmates together, but ever sense the incident at the mall she’s had this growing feeling. Almost like a relationship had formed between two close friends, and she didn’t even get to help the two get together.

*‘Eh, it’s probably nothing.'*
