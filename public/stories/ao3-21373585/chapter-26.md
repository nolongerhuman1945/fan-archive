“Your fate will match theirs…”

Izuku and Kyouka were rooted to the spot, Stain’s eyes burning with an inner flame unlike any other they had ever seen. The look of murder, and unwavering will to do so. The low-level thugs at the USJ were nothing compared to this. They knew then and there, this was truly their first test as heroes. 

“Oh this is all kinds of bad,” Kyouka got down, grabbing Iida by his uninjured arm and trying to lift, but she struggled, his heavy armor and deadweight not helping in the slightest, “Hey, Iida, a little effort, please?”

Tenya grunted as he struggled to move even a single muscle, but nothing happened. “I’m sorry, but I can’t move. I’m paralyzed. Once he cut me, I was completely immobilized. I think it’s his quirk.”

Izuku moved over to Native, doing his best to keep his eyes trained on Stain for any sign of movement. “Sir, can you move?” When they received no response, Kyouka raised her jacks towards the downed hero. 

“He’s breathing, but it’s slow. He’s out cold.” 

Stain pulled out his serrated blade, walking towards the heroes-in-training, “Showing concern for an injured man? Take notes, Ingenium,” Stain mocked. 

“Shut up!” Iida growled at the vigilante. “You two need to get out of here! This is my fight! I don’t want your help!” 

Kyouka pulled her weapon from her back, “All the more reason to be here.”

Izuku raised his fists, preparing to strike. “Because giving help, even when it’s not asked for, is what makes a true hero,” Izuku finished for her, quoting what All Might had said. 

The trio of teens were shocked, and a little creeped out, as Stain suddenly stopped in tracks, gasped and smiled widely. Kyouka shivered, “Okay, I’m gonna have to ask you to not do that.” 

*“Kyouka,”* Izuku whispered, attracting his girlfriend’s attention. She looked down to see Izuku holding his phone behind his back. *“Take my phone, call for help. I’ll keep him distracted.”*

Kyouka aggressively whispered, *“Oh no, you’re not doing the whole ‘I’ll hold him off while you get help’. I’m not leaving you alone with a psycho-killer.”*

Izuku shook his head, holding his phone behind his back, *"More like I'll hold him off for ten seconds. Send Todoroki our location."*

*"Todoroki? What about All Might or Torino?"*

*"They're busy with the Nomus, they won't notice the texts until it's too late. Endeavor can’t be too far away from the action, which means Todoroki should be close by. The pros are needed there, anyway."*

*"There?! What about here?! With the murderer!"*

*"Kyouka, we're well past the point of no return."*

Kyouka grumbled, grabbing the phone from Izuku's hand, *"Just let me find Todoroki’s number."*

Izuku began his part of the plan as his body sparked to life, and he rushed towards the enemy. Izuku slid under Stain, right between his legs. The killer swung around to slash at the teen, but Izuku redirected power to his back, firing a scattershot of energy behind him. The blast hit Stain directly, and the kickback from the pulse sent Izuku the opposite direction. Shooting another shot of energy from his back, Izuku used his supercharged leap forward to go over Stain’s head, but Stain was ready this time. 

His serrated machete was already jabbing right in Izuku’s direction. Izuku panicked, blasting his excess power towards the sky, sending him back to the Earth and allowing him to uppercut the killer and gain more distance. But, not without feeling the blade drag across his arm. 

Izuku had expected at least a few seconds to recover, but quickly had to side-step as a throwing knife flew just past his cheek. Stain lowered his throwing arm, mumbling to himself as he waited for Izuku to attack again. 

*‘Is he…waiting for me?’* Izuku then thought about the knife that was thrown at him. Stain was clearly a trained killer who had taken down multiple heroes much more experienced than a fifteen-year-old. That knife thrown went to the left of his head, clearly aimed for the cheek. Izuku then looked down at where the machete had cut him on his right arm, finding that it had fortunately only sliced through the outer fabric and just about halfway through the armored weave underneath. He would have to thank Kyouka for insisting he asked for armor. And, by insisting, he meant she said he had no choice in the matter because she refused to have him dying on her. 

He suddenly felt a hand on his shoulder, and he looked to his left to find Kyouka with her weapon out and ready to fight. “Alright, what did I miss?”

“I don’t think he’s trying to kill us.”

“Because most signs point to the fact that we should probably both be dead by now?”

“Pretty much.”

"Because you two are worth keeping alive." Izuku and Kyouka faltered at Stain's confessions, neither sure how to take that. "Your intentions are good and true, to save those in need. You carry philosophies like All Might’s, your hearts are in the right place. You two shall become good, true heroes. Neither of you shall die today."

Izuku and Kyouka looked at one another, then back towards Stain. Kyouka nodded nervously, "Um…Thank you, uh…if that's the case, then we'll just take these two and get outta your hai-"

"No," Stain growled, "these two fakes stay. They need to die."

Kyouka rolled her eyes, getting back into a fighting position, "Then we still have a problem."

"We're not going anywhere until they're safe, and you've been stopped," Izuku agreed.

Stain chuckled, “Oh, I really like you two.” Stain charged this time, his curved blade brandished.

“Give him no ground to stand on!” Izuku shouted. 

  
“On it!” Kyouka slammed her Equalizer on the ground, cracking and shaking the pavement below them. Stain’s pursuit didn’t stop, as he opted to jump up and run the short distance on the wall before vaulting towards his opponents. 

Izuku bounced off the opposite wall, meeting Stain halfway in a clash. Stain swung an axe kick, and Izuku had no time to dodge. He did the best he could by allowing the blow from the spiked boots to hit his shoulder pauldron. But, Stain’s reach with his long blade swiped just at Izuku’s jawline and drew blood. 

*‘No!’* Izuku thought. He hit the ground, turning to see Stain raise his blade up to his lips.

*\*THWACK\** 

The side of Stain’s head was bashed by Kyouka’s Equalizer just before he could take in the blood. He grunted in pain, slashing down at Kyouka. 

The musician gasped, dodging to the right, and bringing up her weapon as Stain slashed again. She caught his blade in between the prongs of her sword. She twisted her weapon in her hand and brought both blades towards the ground. Stain brought his other hand up, knife at the ready, but Izuku latched onto the criminal's back and grabbed his wrist.  

Using the opportunity, Kyouka sent strong vibrations through The Equalizer, violently shaking both Stain’s arm and his blade. The weapon shattered, the blade, along with Izuku’s blood, lost in the process. Stain threw Izuku over his shoulder and into Kyouka, both teens tumbling to the ground. Looking up, Izuku saw a dagger coming right for his leg. He got ready to evade, when suddenly…

*\*SHNNK\**

Stain was pushed back as large shards of ice enveloped the alley. Shoto stood at the entrance of the alley, frost and flame billowing around his body. “You two should really be more specific with your messages. You’re lucky I could interpret your sudden location as a call for help.”

Kyouka groaned, but was relieved to see more help, “As you can see, I was in a bit of a hurry. Next time I’ll be sure to send a nice, long text to you when we’re being attacked.” 

Izuku helped Kyouka up, training his eyes back on Stain as the killer examined his new combatant with irritation. "You saw what he was about to do after he cut me, right?"

"The part where he tried to eat your blood? Either it's a part of his quirk, or he's even more insane than we expected…or both."

"It explains the knife collection," Shoto added as he walked up and stood next to his classmates. "I can give you guys support from here, keep him off balance, and be able to keep him away from Iid-"

"No!" Tenya shouted from the ground, still struggling to move. "All of you, stop! None of you should be here!"

Kyouka turned around to her friend with an aggravated growl, "Iida! We're well past that!"

"Even now…" Stain started from the other end of the alley, "after your friends show up to save your pathetic life, you still are hellbent on nothing, but revenge. You make me sick."

Kyouka shook her head in disbelief, " *He* makes you sick? You're a psychotic murderer."

Stain scoffed, pointing his sword towards the still paralyzed Native, “You’re friend here didn’t even give this other faker a glance, more than happy to let him die if it meant getting his revenge. He’s no hero.”

Izuku clenched his fists, “Iida is a hero, I know it. He’s just hurt. He’s going through so much pain that *you* put on him.”

“True heroes must endure pain!” Stain snapped back. “Heroes are meant to endure! To take that pain and use it to fuel their heroism! Not to use it for their own selfish gain! If his brother was even half the hero and inspiration that fake claims him to be, then he would know that already! His brother was weak!” He jabbed his sword towards Iida, “He is weak! A fake! And now he must die like one! Open your eyes. You’re smart kids, I can tell. You have to be able to tell how different you are from the rest. How many of your fellow students, who aren’t even pros yet, have selfish and delusional goals? Money?” Their minds immediately flashed to Ochako, who they both knew needed money for selfless and admirable goals. But, it still couldn’t be ignored that if she achieved her goals, it would only benefit her and her family alone. “Foolish ego and pride.” Todoroki’s mind moved to his father, but Izuku instead thought of Katsuki, both hellbent on being the best with saving the lives of others merely being an afterthought. Hell, or simply even just a work requirement. Stain pointed at Tenya, "Idiotic wish-fulfillment, trying to live up to some pathetic legacy. You didn’t become a hero to help the world, to save lives. You became a hero so your sham of a brother would be proud of you, in turn just so you could be proud of yourself. It's all about *you* ." Stain pulled out three talon knives, slipping them between his fingers while his other hand grasped one of his short swords. " *Ingenium* fell to my blade once. And, now he shall do it again."

Stain advanced again, his blades at the ready.

“Remember, he paralyzes you by ingesting your blood!” Izuku reminded them. Shoto sent more ice, and while it didn’t harm Stain, he kept him at bay if only for a little longer. Izuku ran up the angled ice and bounced from wall to wall before throwing a punch at the criminal. Stain swiftly dodged to the side, leaving Izuku to punch the wall instead, leaving cracked bricks behind. 

“You’ve got some power in you, kid.” Stain slashed at Izuku, with the teen barely dodging, losing a few hairs in the process. The two began trying to trade blows, but neither were managing to hit the other. Izuku jumped back, his hands firing out energy as he pushed off the wall to drop kick the criminal, but Stain slipped under him. Just as he rolled away from the attack, Stain heard a yell from up above. 

Kyouka had run up Shoto’s ice and leaped with her sword above her head, “Bass Drop!” 

…Her leg was grabbed mid-fall and she was thrown into Izuku for the second time that evening, causing the teens to fumble to the concrete. “Ugh, that went so much better in my head.” 

“Rah!” Stain launched at the teens, preparing to strike. Izuku quickly tried to fire out more power, but in true One For All fashion his quirk backfired. Izuku had used his new ability too much. His arm locked up, his muscles contracting when he needed them most. His forearm was cut, and his blood consumed before they could do anything about it. Izuku froze, his body unmoving. 

"No! Izuku!”  Kyouka tried to run to him, but unfortunately Stain decided she would be the next target. Kyouka jumped back, Stain’s blade hitting the ground where she was standing. Shoto sent ice their way, but Stain dodged and hopped over the ice spikes, throwing small daggers in Shoto’s direction. The blades embedded themselves in Todoroki’s right arm, causing the teenager to clutch his arm in pain. 

Using his small window of opportunity, Stain slashed at Kyouka’s cheek. She managed to dodge out of the way, her left jack quickly wrapping itself securely around Stain’s wrist and yanking him forward. Stain’s other hand shot out, a blade popping out from his wrist, and this time Kyouka wasn’t fast enough. The knife stabbed into her shoulder, but she kept Stain at bay by thrusting the Equalizer and trapping his arm in between the prongs of the weapon and vibrating it at dangerous speeds. 

“Grraah!” Stain cried out as his arm was shifted and shaken violently in between the metal prongs, causing him to drop the knife covered in Kyouka’s blood. Kyouka kicked him away and picked up the knife to put in her pocket. Stain grunted as his arm shook on its own, his control over the limb near impossible. 

Izuku panicked as his friends were assaulted by Stain, internally screaming at himself for slipping up. He had to do something, and fast. But, he couldn’t move a muscle. How was he supposed to…

*‘It’s almost as if I didn’t just spend the last two days figuring out the solution to this problem.’* Mustering up the last drops of overflow power he could, Izuku exploded One For All from the front of his body, sending his paralyzed form careening towards Stain.

Using his good arm, Stain raised his sword above his head, preparing to attack Kyouka again. 

*\*SLAM\**

Izuku rammed right into the criminal’s back, causing them both to fall to the ground. Kyouka ran over, picking Izuku up by the armpits. “Thanks for the save.”

Izuku, still paralyzed, looked up at a now even further pissed off Stain getting up, “Saved is sort of subjective, really.” Thankfully, a wall of fire suddenly ignited in between them and Stain, keeping them apart. Even more relieved that they had contacted Todoroki, Kyouka began dragging Izuku away from the fire. “W-Wait, hold on.” Izuku focused on his hand, realizing that he could move his fingers. “Help me stand up.” Pushing him to his feet, Izuku wobbled for a few seconds before feeling his entire body start to tingle. It was slow at first, but Izuku began to move around like normal. “It…I-It wore off?”

“Maybe the more people he uses it on at once, it becomes weaker,” Kyouka responded with a shrug. 

“It’s only Iida and I. He has no reason to keep using it on Native, he’s unconscious. Hm..What about blood type?”

“Uh, Izuku…” Kyouka pointed at the fire as Stain jumped through the blaze. “...I really don’t think it’s important anymore.” 

“Fair enough.” 

The teens got ready for more, the battle continuing on. Iida seethed in anger on the ground, desperation in his voice, “All of you, stop. Please…I can’t take it anymore. I inherited the Ingenium name. I have to be the one to do this.”

Todoroki blasted another inferno in Stain’s direction, doing his best to keep him at bay, “Last I checked, Ingenium didn’t act like this. Guess you’ve got your dark side, too, huh?” Iida looked up at Todoroki, confusion on his face. “Iida, I’m going to tell you the exact same thing that was told to me not so long ago! Never forget who you want to become!” Kyouka punched one of Shoto's ice stalagmites with her speaker, shattering the formation and pelting Stain with shards as Izuku attacked from behind. “You want to stop this? Then stand up! Fight for your brother as the hero he would have wanted you to be! Your own hero!”

Stain had quite enough of Todoroki’s incessant ice and fire annoyances. Ducking under a right hook from Izuku, he grabbed the teen and chucked him at Kyouka. 

“Umph!” Kyouka fell to the ground with Izuku on her stomach, “Stop throwing us into each other!” 

Stain leapt through the flames, his sword aiming for Shoto's left arm. “Let’s free you from your fraud of a father’s flame now, shall we?”

*\*ZWOOSH\**

In the blink of an eye, Stain’s blade was snapped in two by a speeding Iida. The Hero Killer was blown back by the force, now standing in the center of the alley. Izuku and Kyouka behind him, and Shoto and Iida in front. “Ugh, so many interruptions.” He pulled out another dagger, brandishing it towards Iida.

“Oh for fuck’s sake,” Kyouka groaned, “Where do you keep getting swords?!”

Iida stood tall, tears in his eyes. “I’m so sorry, to all of you. This had nothing to do with you, yet you were dragged into something that never should have even happened.”

Stain peered at Tenya, “Apologizing won’t get you anywhere. You’re just another flame of corrupted ambition in a broken hero society that needs to be snuffed out.”

Shoto held back from rolling his eyes, “Don’t listen to him, Iida.” 

“No…He’s right. Everything he’s said about me has been right. But, I won’t let anyone else die because of him. I refuse to let my friends shed their own blood due to my own foolish mistakes and pride. For tonight, I am Iida. Otherwise known as Ingenium. I will take him down as a hero. Not for revenge, but for the sake of others.”

Scoffing, Stain sneered at the teen, “You’re hopeless. You think that little speech will save you? Do you know how many people have tried to act their way out of their deserved deaths? You don’t change in one night.”

“Then shouldn’t you give them a chance to change?” Kyouka replied, still confused on the Hero Killer’s logic. 

“Heh, not my policy.” Stain rushed the two in front of him, but Shoto sent out another blazing inferno. Stain hopped up the walls, throwing more daggers at Todoroki, but Iida threw his own arm out in the way, the knives piercing right through his armor.

Kyouka and Izuku began running towards the fight, but Kyouka stopped in her tracks, an idea forming in her head. “Okay, it’s clear the Pros aren’t going to make it here in time. We’ve gotta end this now! You all might wanna cover your ears!” Kyouka cranked up her hand speakers, pumping as much sound as she could through her jacks. Punching her fists together, A piercing shriek pulsed through the alley and shook everyone to their core. 

The noise hit Stain like a truck, his head suddenly pounding with pain. That single falter turned out to be his downfall.

*\*CKAKLE\**

Stain's arm was suddenly caught in the Shoto’s ice, the new formation growing and dragging him up the back wall. Kyouka and Izuku dived out of the way as the spikes of ice formed past them, slamming Stain against the building. He growled, raising a knife to break the ice, but Kyouka was quick on her feet.

"Izuku! Catch!"

She sent vibrations through her sword and threw it to Izuku. Holding the weapon like a javelin, Izuku rocketed the sword at Stain.

Stain’s neck went right in between the prongs as the sword jammed into the wall,  effectively trapping him. Izuku landed, quickly breaking into a Full Cowl 10% sprint up the right wall. Tenya’s engines sparked to life, his movements synchronizing with Izuku’s up the left wall. 

The last thing Stain saw were two bright lights from either side of his vision.

"SMASH!!!"

“RECIPRO BURST!!!”

Izuku slammed his fist right into Stain’s cheek, and Iida kicked him in the side. Their combined force shattered the ice around them, and sent Stain tumbling through the air and to the ground below. Izuku and Iida both fell ungracefully to the ground as well, but Shoto made a slide of ice to ease their fall. 

The four students all walked over to the body of the Hero Killer, each one waiting cautiously for him to wake up. 

Izuku looked over at the criminal, trying to see any movement, "...I-Is it over?"

Stain's body twitched just slightly, "Ugh…"

Kyouka kicked him, making him go still once again, "More or less."

“Take his weapons, just in case,” Iida advised. “We should also find a way to restrain him. I doubt we’ll find any rope around here…” 

All eyes suddenly shifted to Kyouka, her own eyes hesitantly meeting theirs. “What…C’mon, I don’t want my jacks touching Teenage Mutant Ninja Voldemort!” The boys all continued to stare at Kyouka, knowing it was the only option. “...I hate you guys.” 

A few minutes later, an unreasonably large pile of swords, daggers, and throwing knives were all on the ground, Stain was wrapped in Kyouka’s jacks and being dragged by her and Izuku, and Shoto and Iida were carrying a now waking up Native out of the alley.

“Urgh…Ah…What happened?” Native asked woozily. 

Kyouka responded, “You were saved from the Hero Killer by four fifteen-year-olds.”

“...No, really, what happened?”

Shoto pointed over his shoulder, “Ask him.” 

Native looked behind him to see Stain being dragged across the ground, “...I wanna go home.” 

Kyouka sighed, “Don’t we all.”

“What the hell are you two doing here?!” Everyone looked over to see Gran Torino and a group of heroes and a few police standing in the street.

Kyouka glared at the heroes, officially done with the bullshit that was the last hour of her life. “Oh, NOW you show up!” 

One of the heroes shrugged their shoulders, “We were told by Endeavor that he believed his son was in trouble and needed back-up. Said he ran off this way, as we can now obviously see.”

Kyouka rolled her eyes, and picked up Stain with a grunt, throwing him at Gran Torino’s feet. “Take him!” 

Sorahiko looked down in confusion, but his eyes widened in realization, “Is…Is that th-”

“Look out!” Everyone looked up after the hero's cry to see the flying Nomu from earlier swooping down towards the group, blood dripping from its eye socket and landing on some of the heroes. Before anyone could properly react, it grabbed Izuku by the arm and dragged him into the air.

“Izuku!” Kyouka cried out. “Huh?!” Kyouka felt her jacks come undone, and Stain was now gone from her grasp. The Nomu suddenly froze in the air, paralysis taking over as the Hero Killer licked its blood off of a blonde hero’s cheek. He jumped up, grabbing Izuku from the Nomu's hold and stabbing the creature in the brain.

The Nomu fell to the ground, dead to the world. Izuku and Stain weren’t far behind, hitting the pavement on their feet. 

  
  

***...~AMP~...***  
  

**(Nearby Watertower)**

Shigaraki looked down at the flames and flashing police light, the wind blowing past him. “Ah, well him killing the Nomu probably fucks this idea up. It was a gamble anyway. We got lucky that he got caught up in the chaos at all."

Kurogiri opened a portal behind them, ushering him to follow, “Don't give up hope, Young Tomura. We simply won't know until the news tomorrow."

"Really? You think there's even a chance that the media will think he works with us after he killed a Nomu and saved Midoriya?"

"The media will create the story they find the most interesting. The Hero Killer attacking exactly during an attack orchestrated by us? Coincidence is possible, but coincidence doesn't make for a good story. The populace will see whatever they want to see."

"Hm...We'll see." Both of them turned around, and walked through the portal, leaving the dying chaos behind.

***...~AMP~...***

  
  
  

Back down on the ground, Izuku scrambled away from Stain, looking back to see the killer simply standing still and muttering to himself. 

“I said…you wouldn’t die tonight…my work is…my mission…” He peeled his mask from his face, and Izuku shuddered at the sight before him. 

“Hero Killer!” Everyone turned to see Endeavor emerge from a sidestreet, his eyes set on the criminal. “This is the chance I’ve been waiting for.”

Gran Torino jumped in the way of Endeavor, his arms out, “Wait! There’s a kid down there. You’ll hit him.”

“TRY IT!!!” Everyone’s attention went back to Stain, everyone freezing at the look in his eyes, his noseless face, and inhuman movement as he walked towards them. “YOU GOD-DAMN FAKE!!! ALL OF YOU SHAMS AND LIARS ARE A PART OF MY PURGE! ALL FOR THE SAKE OF A BETTER SOCIETY! THE ONLY ONE ALLOWED TO KILL ME IS…is…" Stain suddenly stopped, his eyes widening as he looked beyond the crowd or pros and police. Everyone turned at the sound of footsteps, their gazes shifting to All Might walking towards them from behind Endeavor. 

**“Sorry about that, everyone. I would have gotten that last Nomu, but** ***someone*** **got a little uppity about my presence here.”** Toshinori said, nudging Endeavor with his elbow. **“It’s okay though, I can tell he likes me. Anyway, who’s that over there who took it down.”** Making his way through the group, he stopped once he was in the front. Toshinori’s smile suddenly faded as he saw who he was facing, **"Hmm, The Hero Killer, I presume?"**

Stain dropped his blade, taking a few steps towards All Might. Every officer pulled out their weapons and set their sights on the vigilante, but were all shocked as the killer formally bowed in front of the number one hero. 

"It's a true honor to meet you. I hoped this day would come."

Toshinori looked around in confusion, not really sure what to do. **"Uh…Thank you?"**

"You are an inspiration, a pure, true hero. The reason I do what I do. Thank you, for everything you do, and are. If you are the one making the arrest, I will not resist and surrender quietly. I'll cooperate with whatever you need."

Toshinori’s confusion was shared with most of the onlookers, and no one attempted to make a move. All Might turned to the nearest officer, **"If you wouldn’t mind, I'd like to borrow your handcuffs."**

The young cop blinked a couple times before hastily handing them over, "Oh, uh…Yes, sir." 

As All Might took the cuffs and put them on Stain, Izuku made it back to his friends with Kyouka giving him a crushing hug. 

Stain looked over at the two, then back up to All MIght. "Please, allow me to say something to them. Just for a moment. That is all I ask."

**“Hm…I suppose.”**

He guided Stain towards the group of teens, but he only had his eyes set on Izuku and Kyouka. “The system is corrupt. Heroes like you truly are a rare breed. So many of them don’t even care about the lives they save. To them it’s all about money, fame, and power. You can’t even begin to fathom just how deep the dark roots of this system go. They made a promise to the world when they decided to become heroes, and day after day they spit in the face of that promise and the people who believed it. I wasn’t lying when I said you two were worth keeping alive. Fulfill that promise. Make a difference, or we’re all doomed.”

Police vans and ambulances approached the group, and Endeavor growled from the side, “That’s enough out of him. C’mon, get him out of here.”

Toshinori pulled him away from the couple, and Stain followed without any resistance, looking over his shoulder as he stepped into the nearest armored van, “Shigaraki has it out for you two. He knows your names and faces. Watch your backs.”

He was hauled away in the van with All Might going with them to keep watch on the criminal. 

“...Izuku?”

“Yeah, Kyouka?”

“This is just the beginning, isn’t it?”

Izuku took a deep breath, processing everything that had happened, “Pretty much.”

Kyouka nodded, “Just making sure.”

The teens were all guided to the nearest ambulance, with Iida being treated first by the paramedics since his injuries were the worst out of them. The van took off to the nearest hospital, their crazy night finally over. Iida’s armor was stripped off of his torso before his wounds were treated. Everyone was quiet, still processing the events of the evening. 

Izuku looked over at Iida, who was staring at the floor with shame all over his face. He barely even reacted to any of the treatment done to his wounds. Izuku knew he had to do something.

"Listen, Iida…" Tenya didn’t look up, continuing to stare at the ambulance floor. Izuku sighed, but continued anyway, “Iida, I know how hard the pressure of legacy is. I can’t really go into how I do, b-but…E-Everyday you’re constantly just trying t-to live up to that person’s expectations. Y-You feel like n-nothing you do is ever good enough, and how time keeps m-moving faster and faster a-and…” Izuku stopped himself, clearing his throat and pausing as he tried to contain his nervous stutter. Kyouka put her hand on his, but he nodded to her in reassurance that he was fine. “...You want nothing more than to be like them, to be just as great as them. To just be…something. Something you can finally be proud of. But, Iida, we have a long way to go from here. I mean, we’re fifteen. Right now, it doesn’t matter how far we are on our paths, because all that matters is that we have the strength to walk it. And, one way or another, we’ll reach our destination. Besides, I’ve also learned that the people we’re trying to prove ourselves to, tend to already think the world of us, even if we don’t understand how.” Izuku squeezed Kyouka’s hand before finishing with, “I know your brother is already proud of you, Iida. Not because he thinks you’ll be him, but because he sees *you,* and what *you’ll* become. Once you see him again, I-I hope you can see that.”  

Kyouka looked over at Iida from behind Izuku, and smiled softly, “And, hey, for what it’s worth, despite you acting pretty crazy today, we’re proud of you, too.” 

They all sat in silence for a bit after that, Izuku finished with his piece. It wasn’t until Izuku felt a hand on his shoulder that the silence was broken. Tenya was still looking at the floor, but a few stray tears fell from his eyes. “Thank you.” 

Izuku nodded, giving Iida’s hand a couple pats before he removed his hand, and continued to sit in silence. Shoto nodded to Izuku across from him, signaling a job well done, and words spoken wisely. Kyouka, as discreetly as possible, kissed Izuku’s shoulder before laying her head down on it, her fatigue catching up to her. Izuku followed shortly after as a heavy weight took over his eyelids, and his world faded to black. 

  
  
  
  

***…~AIV~...***

  
  
  

**(Hosu City General Hospital: Kyouka’s Room)**

  
  

*\*Knock\* \*Knock\**

The door slid open, revealing All Might in his full form. **"Ah, there you are, my young ward!"** Closing the door behind him, Toshinori popped into his normal look with a cough of blood, “God-damn it I’m so tired.” He sat down in the chair next to Kyouka’s bed with a loud groan. 

Kyouka chuckled, “You act like you're a one-hundred-year-old man.”

“I’ve been a professional hero for thirty years. If you’re not careful the same will happen to you. Speaking of which, how are you? Not too hurt? How’s your shoulder?”

Kyouka rubbed her stab wound, nodding her head, “Thank goodness I wear a padded leather jacket. It hurt like hell, but they said the knife didn’t go too deep. I’ll be fine tomorrow with another treatment of healing quirks. I did get a pretty sweet souvenir out of it, though.” Kyouka reached over to her jacket, which was laying on the bedside table. She pulled a blood covered talon knife from the pocket. “...I should probably wash it. Did Stain keep his word?”

“Yeah. He took the transport to Tartarus without resisting. He should be there soon.”

Kyouka sighed in relief, thankful that Stain’s strange obsessions played in their favor again, “Have you been to see Izuku?”

“I have, but unlike you, he didn’t get his own room. I went as All Might checking on his students, nothing more. I need to be sure to talk to him when I get the chance.”

Kyouka smiled, “I’m happy you took our conversation yesterday to heart.”

Toshinori sighed, nodding his head. “I know I've made mistakes, and will continue to do so. I'm not a particularly good teacher, not to my students, much less to Young Midoriya. He's learned more on his own and with Torino in the last few months than the entire year and a half I've known him. And if All For One really is back, and with what the Hero Killer told you two about Shigaraki...Well, then to be perfectly honest with you, I don't know how much time I have left. I'm not exactly the hero I used to be when I fought him the first time, and even back then I barely escaped with my life." Toshinori raised a hand to his face, feeling the gaunt features, "My appearance now is proof of that. I keep telling myself that he'll never have to fight All For One, because I'll do it for him. And that'll happen. But, there won't be a chance for us both to hide and lick our wounds this time...this time, there will be a victor. And my chances are...Let's just say I realize now just how attentive I should've been towards Young Midoriya. I need to prepare him, I need t-"

"I'm gonna stop you right there," Kyouka interrupted, sitting up in her hospital bed. "Do you wanna know what I've learned from Izuku? Well, a lot of things actually. But one of the main things is how accepting fate is a bunch of bullshit. His entire life, Izuku was told he had no hope. Whether or not he could've been a hero doesn't matter here. Call it unrealistic, as you once did, but he still stood his ground. What if he accepted that a long time ago? Studied other subjects, went a different direction? But he didn't. And here he stands, with you and I. If you accept you're going to die, then you will. No matter how I acted yesterday, I definitely don't want that. Izuku obviously doesn't either. Japan, and the rest of the world don't. So do us all a favor, and don't just fight for the world. Fight for yourself, too."

"It's my job to put others before myself."

"I never said put yourself first, just...on equal ground. Do you think Izuku would want you to just accept death? Or Torino? Shimura?"

"...Now that's a cheap shot."

"A cheap shot for a good reason."

Toshinori took in every word, letting it all sink in before nodding. "I'll make no promises, but...I will try. For Young Midoriya...and you."

"Good. Besides, who else is going to have a bias towards me in class. Aizawa? Like hell."

Toshinori chuckled, "If I'm going to learn how to be a better teacher, then favoritism is going to diminish from this point forward."

Kyouka smirked, squinting her eyes. "Completely?"

"...Okay, not *entirely.* "

"There we go."

"But, when it comes to teaching Young Midoriya alone, I'll need some help from you. Keep his spirit alive  Just continue to be by his side."

"Always." Kyouka sighed, idly playing with her fingers as she stared at her lap, “Besides, I’m not the only one who took our talk yesterday seriously. I need to have a long-overdue conversation with him.”

“Now? Young Jirou, you’ve just gone through a great ordeal.”

“And, he and I are parting ways again tomorrow. I already stepped onto this rollercoaster of a day, I’m going to see it through to the end. Tonight was just another reminder that he and I are in this, whatever it is, together until the end. No matter what that end is. He’s laid his cards out on the table, I’ll do the same. Honestly, after last night I can’t stop thinking about it. I need to just steel myself and say. No hesitation. I’ve hesitated enough.” 

All Might nodded, understanding the seriousness of the situation. He put a comforting hand on her arm, “I’m proud of you. Very proud. But, are you sure you’ve got this? There’s absolutely no shame in waiting.”

Kyouka still felt queasy at the prospect of finally unleashing everything she had been feeling for so long, but she nodded to her mentor. “I’ve got this.”

**(A Few Hours Later)**

  
  

Kyouka looked out her window and at the full moon high in the sky, her text to Izuku was sent only a few minutes ago. Her lights were already out, the doctor recommending she go to sleep quite some time ago. But, despite the clear fatigue she felt, she couldn’t sleep. Not yet.

*\*Knock Knock\**

Kyouka looked over at the door as it opened, thankful that it was Izuku and not a doctor or nurse. Izuku smiled, closing the door behind him, "Hey. You wanted to see me?"

Kyouka chuckled, propping herself up on the pillows, "I always want to see you."

"You get what I mean," Izuku laughed in return, moving his way towards Kyouka in the darkness. "You wanted to see me enough to ask me here this late."

"And you wanted to see me so much you did it without question."

"Fair enough." Kyouka patted the spot next to her, prompting Izuku to slide under the blankets and get close. He lifted his arm up, allowing Kyouka to slip under and rest her head on his chest. "After today, I needed this badly. I've missed you these last couple days."

"I've missed you, too."

"Is that why you asked me he-"

"I hate my body."

Izuku froze, his words dying on his lips. "...What?" Izuku looked down at Kyouka, but she wasn't looking back. She was still resting her head on his chest. All he could see was the top of her head.

She knew she just threw her confession out there and expected him to catch it. But, she wasn’t exaggerating when she told All Might she was done hesitating. She was living with this corrosion in her soul for over a decade, and she was sick and tired of it. But, now that she pulled the cork off of her bottle, everything came spilling out uncontrollably.

"...I hate it. So. Much. Everything I wear feels and looks wrong. I pull, tug, and shift all my clothes, but it never works. I'm too pale, I'm not curvy, I'm...I-I'm...flat. Even when I look at just my face I don't think I'm pretty." Izuku felt her start to shake as she tried to hold back sobs. "You're the only person that's ever made me feel beautiful. Just being here with you makes me feel like so much more, but...When you're gone? The foundation you build up in me just collapses. Even when I don't think about it, it's in the back of my mind, waiting to come back at any moment." Kyouka tried to wipe away her tears, but they kept coming in full force. "It's even why I wear your clothes. It makes me feel better. I'm sorry for bringing this up so randomly. I know you have a lot of things on your mind already. Much more important things."

Izuku suddenly pushed her off of him, laying her down on the bed as he hovered over her. He saw her tears stream down her face as she tried to hide herself, covering as much of her face and body with her arms as she could. "H-...How long have you hated your body?"

 Kyouka brought Izuku down to her so she could hide in his shoulder, "A really long time."

"I-...I should have…" Izuku closed his eyes, furrowing his brow in anger. Not towards Kyouka, but towards himself. "After the beach, Shinsou, that call, I...I-I suspected something, but...I-I'm such an idiot."

"No, no you're not. It's my fault for not saying anything. The only reason I'm saying anything now is because All Might saw right through me. He convinced me to tell you, and I just couldn't hold it in any longer."

"Even he could tell?" Izuku groaned, internally kicking himself over and over again. "You've been suffering, and I couldn't see it. After everything you've done for me, and I was so caught up in my own stupid problems-"

Kyouka cupped Izuku's cheeks, cutting him off, "What did I say about your problems? Everyone's issues are their own, and are significant to them in their own ways. This is just mine. And it's like I just said, even though you didn't know, you've been the only thing helping me."

She wiped Izuku's eyes as tears started to form. Kyouka almost laughed, because that's just who Izuku was. He was crying *for* her. "But...B-But, you said when I'm gone…"

"Then never leave me. Got it?"

After a quick, dry laugh, Izuku nodded. "Yes, ma'am." Izuku leaned down, pressing his forehead to her's. "But that's not good enough for me. Everyday. Everyday I'll try to show you how beautiful you are, until you finally see it. I want you to see what I see. What everyone sees, but you. Okay?"

Kyouka nodded, pressing her forehead to Izuku's. "Okay…I care about you."

Izuku hugged Kyouka close, "I care about you...more than anything. And...thank you, for telling me. I know I can be kind of dense, but I have you to get through to me. Y-You and I...We kinda both have problems with bottling up, huh?"

"Hehe, yeah." 

"You've made my burdens your burdens, and I never had to ask. I'm going to do the same for you."

Kyouka chuckled, deepening her voice to imitate All Might, "Butting into others' problems and helping them, even when it's not asked for, shows the true makings of a hero." Izuku returned her laugh, lying back down and pressing a kiss to Kyouka's lips. Kyouka wiped her eyes again, taking a deep breath as she finally calmed down. "You should go. We don't want a doctor catching us."

"I'm not going anywhere. I want to stay with you. If I can make you feel better, I'm going to do it as much as I can."

"You're willing to face the eventual embarrassment?"

"Are you?" Kyouka hummed in response, but her further burrowing under the blankets and nuzzling into Izuku's chest showed she wasn't objecting. Izuku chuckled, following her example,"I'll take that as a yes."

"Hey," Kyouka's voice came out muffled from Izuku's chest, "we've been in bed together before, but this is the first time sleeping together in one."

"Mhm?"

Kyouka hugged Izuku tighter, basking in the warmth and tangle of their limbs, "And it's somehow even better than I expected it to be." As her eyelids grew heavier by the second, Kyouka's heart and body felt lighter. 

After so many years, someone else finally knew. Someone she trusted, someone who wanted to share the burden and help her through it, someone who wanted to shower her in affection and show his belief in her.

It was more than she could have ever asked for. It was more than she thought she deserved, but Izuku probably was...No, Kyouka knew Izuku felt the same. 

And, she couldn't deny after trying her best to be someone's pillar for so long, it was nice to remember she could lean on him, too. She still had a long way to go, but Izuku was here for her.

What more could she need?

*\*Knock Knock\**

Iida opened the door with Shoto behind him. "I'm so sorry to disturb you so late, Jirou. But, Midoriya left a while ago and I was wondering if you'd seen hi-..." Both teens froze at the sight of Izuku in bed with Kyouka. 

Izuku and Kyouka both tried to come up with any sort of excuse for their position, but nothing believable came to mind. Izuku tried to stammer out some answers out of pure panic. "U-Um...W-Well, I was just trying t-to-."

Todoroki looked around the room, "Hm, sorry, Jirou. I guess he's not here. Right, Iida?"

Tenya nodded, a smile gracing his features. "Yes, I don't believe I see him either. I'm sure he'll turn up sooner or later. I apologize for the intrusion, Jirou. We'll come by tomorrow morning to see how you're doing. Good night."

Izuku and Kyouka looked at each other with wide eyes, both stunned at what was happening. Kyouka looked back at them, nodding her head, "Uh...Yeah. Good night, guys. And, uh...Thanks." Iida nodded, closing the door as they left. “...Izuku?”

“Yeah, Kyouka?”

“...We have awesome friends.”

“We sure do.”
