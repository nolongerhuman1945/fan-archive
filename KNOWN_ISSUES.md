# Known Issues

This document lists known issues that are not bugs in the application code, but rather environmental or browser extension-related issues.

## Browser Extension Console Errors

### jQuery CSP Violation

**Error Message:**
```
Executing inline script violates the following Content Security Policy directive 'script-src 'self' 'wasm-unsafe-eval' 'inline-speculation-rules' chrome-extension://...'
```

**Description:**
This error is caused by browser extensions (specifically Brave browser's built-in jQuery extension) trying to execute inline scripts. This is not an issue with the archive site code.

**Status:** ✅ Not a bug - Browser extension issue
**Impact:** None - Does not affect site functionality
**Resolution:** No action needed. This can be safely ignored or filtered in browser console.

### Message Channel Error

**Error Message:**
```
Uncaught (in promise) Error: A listener indicated an asynchronous response by returning true, but the message channel closed before a response was received
```

**Description:**
This error is caused by browser extensions communicating with web pages. Similar to the jQuery error, this is not generated by the site code.

**Status:** ✅ Not a bug - Browser extension issue
**Impact:** None - Does not affect site functionality
**Resolution:** No action needed. This can be safely ignored.

### vite.svg 404 Error

**Error Message:**
```
vite.svg:1 Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 404
```

**Description:**
This error occurs if the default Vite favicon is referenced but not present. The site uses its own favicon (`site-icon.png`).

**Status:** ✅ Resolved - Removed vite.svg reference from index.html (if present)
**Impact:** None - Only affects missing favicon, site functionality is unaffected
**Resolution:** Verify that `index.html` does not reference `vite.svg`. Use `site-icon.png` instead.

## Notes

- All console errors listed here are from external sources (browser extensions, default Vite configs) and do not indicate problems with the archive site code.
- Site functionality is fully operational despite these console messages.
- These errors can be safely ignored or filtered in browser developer tools.
