**(A Few Days Later: Jirou Household** **)**

Izuku raised his hand to knock on the door of the Jirou Residence, only for it to swing open and to be dragged in by Kyouka. "C'mon! C'mon! My letter just got here!"

Izuku laughed, waving at the elder Jirous as he was dragged up the stairs, "I'm coming!"

The teens made it to Kyouka's room and closed the door behind them. The teenage girl walked over to her desk and lifted up a letter. "You bring yours?"

Izuku pulled out his letter from the back pocket of his jeans. "Right here." U.A had finally sent out the packages of proper documentation for parents and students to sign, along with uniforms and class information. "I don't really understand why they didn't just send this stuff with the hologram disk."

Kyouka smirked, "If the entrance exam is anything to go by, then this will probably be the least confusing and over-complicated decision that U.A makes."

Izuku thought back to everything that had happened that day, and added the fact that All Might was going to be a teacher. He sighed, nodding his head. "You're probably right."

"Nevermind that now. What class are you in? Wait, together on three?"

Izuku nodded, "One."

"Two."

"Three."

"Class 1-A!/Class 1-A!"

Both began beaming, and Kyouka put her hands on her knees in relief, "Oh thank goodness. Now I don't have to put in effort on meeting new people. The only way this would be better is if Blondie McAnger-Management isn't in our class."

"One can only hope. I don't hate him as much as he hates me, but...okay, I *do* hate him and he's a jerk, but I-... It's complicated."

Kyouka leaned back against her desk with a raised brow. "It's strange to hear you say you hate something. Especially another person."

Izuku sighed and shrugged his shoulders as he sat down on Kyouka’s bed. "Hate is a strong word, but I don't really know how else to say it. I admire his strength, abilities, and confidence…"

"But?"

"...But, he's the biggest dick in the world."

"Pfft! Hahahaha!" Kyouka bursted out laughing at Izuku's uncharacteristic choice of words. "I'm such a good influence on you."

"I find that questionable," Izuku joked, chuckling in return.

Kyouka walked over to Izuku and ruffled his hair. "Don't worry about him. All that matters right now is that we're going to be together. If he's in our class, he's gonna have to get through me first."

Izuku pressed his lips together, "Not that I don't have confidence in your abilities, Kyouka. But, Kacchan can go through a lot."

"He hasn't met me. I'll make fun of him so bad that he'll be crying in the corner."

Izuku chuckled, "I can't even fatho-"

"And if he keeps pushing, he'll be crying because my boot will be so far up his ass that he'll be tasting rubber."

"...Thanks for that image."

"No problem, Asparagus. Now, next on the agenda."

"We have an agenda?"

Kyouka hummed and grabbed a pen from her desk, "Did you bring your notebook?"

"Oh, yeah." Izuku nodded as he  pulled out his notebook from his jacket pocket. "Why?"

"Because…" Kyouka grabbed it and began to flip through the pages until stopping on the page she was looking for. "...we're working on this." In front of Izuku was the old sketch he had done for his future hero costume. "You helped me with mine, so I'll help you with yours."

"I really don't think we're gonna figure out how to help my quirk with support gear."

His friend shook her head, "Yeah, I know. I'm talking about helping you design-wise."

"What's wrong with the design?"

"Nothing, it's just that…" Kyouka looked back down at the sketch, trying to find the proper words, but came up with nothing. "No. No, like so much. There's so much wrong with this."

"Wh-? L-Like what?"

"First off, why are you a rabbit?"

Izuku tilted his head in confusion, "What are you talking about?"

Kyouka flipped the paper around to face him. "The bunny ears."

"Oh! No, those aren't bunny ears. Those are supposed to be like All Might's two front bangs. I don't know where you got bunny ears fr-..." Izuku continued to look at the design, his face slowly turning into one of realization, and then exasperation. He sighed, "...Damn it."

"We have a lot of work to do."

***...~AIV~...***

**(2 Weeks Later: Jirou Household Basement)**

"I think this is counterproductive." Izuku nodded at Kyouka's words as they stared at sand pouring out of the recently purchased punching bag and on to Kyouka's basement floor. The two had gone out and bought a punching bag for Kyouka to practice her new fighting style on.

For some reason, neither of the fairly intelligent teens thought about the fact that Kyouka would have to jab her jacks into the workout equipment.

Izuku turned to his best friend, "Plan C?"

"We don't have a Plan C."

"Plan A hurts me though."

"It only hurts you individually because you won't hit back. It's the most efficient, and it helps both of us at the same time."

Izuku sighed, knowing there was no way out of it. "Can we at least get me some form of protection this time?"

***...~AIV~...***

**(Some Time Later: Dagobah Municipal Beach Park)**

The two were now at Dagobah again with a brand new punching bag.

...A green-haired, freckled punching bag.

The teens had moved their training to Dagobah because Kyoutoku and Mika didn't want any sparring in the house. There was a decent outside space for them to train back at the house, but the beach had quickly become special to them. Well, it was already special to Izuku, but Kyouka had also grown attached.

Of course, their time together the previous week and the trip home afterwards were major factors. But, they had gone back to the beach a few times already, making it their personal training area. Kyouka was still shocked that nobody but them ever showed up there, but she couldn't deny she enjoyed the privacy. Kyouka tore off the last piece of duct tape from the roll as the setting sun bathed the beach in a warm orange glow.

"You comfortable?" Kyouka asked.

"I have pillows duct taped around my body. I'm comfortable, so the real question is: Can I breathe?"

"...Can you?"

"U-Uh...I'll warn you when everything starts to look fuzzy. Why aren't you wearing pillows again?"

"You refuse to hit me, remember?"

"I hit back!"

Kyouka scoffed amusedly, "Sure. If you can call punching so light that it wouldn't even hurt a butterfly 'hitting back'."

Izukur rubbed the back of his head and replied, "I don't actually want to hurt you, and it's more to teach you how to dodge."

"Some women would take offense to that, but my sparring partner is a guy that has a power that he can barely control and might turn me into nothing but a red splatter mark in the sand. Even without your quirk you're strong enough to probably break something, so…"

Izuku already had some combat training under his belt, so Kyouka learning at least the basics was his true priority. He would feel a lot more comfortable with truly sparring with her once she was at a high enough skill-level. Although sparring with Kyouka was helping him with spatial awareness in a fight...and it was helping him learn to not get distracted when he found his opponent very attractive.

Kyouka let her jacket fall off of her shoulders as she got into a fighting stance. Her fists up, her right hand closer to her shoulder and her left slightly extended out. "Ready?"

Under the pillows, Izuku began to glow as he mirrored Kyouka. After revealing his discovery about his power to All Might, his mentor warned him to keep his power low. Percentages and such were still pretty vague, especially since Izuku had no true gauge of what his full power truly was. So, he kept his power to just the smallest little portion he could muster without his body stinging.

"Ready."

Immediately, Kyouka sent quick jabs towards Izuku's chest and was blocked by the boy's arm. While distracting Izuku with her punches, her right jack shot out and jabbed into his side. He slightly jerked away from the vibrations, giving Kyouka an opening to throw a right hook into her sparring partner's body. The pillows, Full Cowl, and Izuku's sturdy body absorbed most of the impact, so it didn't slow him down. He batted away one of Kyouka's jacks coming directly for his shoulder and threw his own punch at Kyouka. But, it seemed that it was what Kyouka was counting on. As his hand came into contact with the jack, it wrapped tightly around his wrist and yanked it away from his body.

She fired her other jack into Izuku's knee and vibrated it, his leg involuntarily failing him for a moment. Kyouka quickly shoved Izuku on to his back, and she pinned him down with her foot on his forearm, her other jack holding down his other hand, and his arm on his chest.

Izuku blushed at the closeness, but chuckled. "Y-You're already getting good at this. It's been less than a week since we started sparring."

Kyouka released her hold on Izuku and sat back on his pillow-covered chest. "I have a good teacher. Plus, it helps that my opponent doesn't hit back."

"S-Sorry."

"Hey, I get it. But, promise me that whenever you feel comfortable with my progress that we fight for real. Okay?"

"Promise." Kyouka hopped off of her friend, and the two continued their training.

***...~AIV~...***

**(Some Time Later: JR Musutafu Train Line)**

"Ugh." Izuku chuckled at Kyouka's groaning in the seat next to him. By the time they had entered the train, the sun had fully gone down and the moon was high. As they waited for the train to depart, the girl Izuku was pining for slumped down into the train seat and blew a raspberry. "You were the one getting beat up and somehow I'm the tired one."

"I had armor," Izuku lifted up the duffel bag filled with their pillows, Kyouka threw her arm over her eyes and slid down even further in her chair as Izuku laughed. "You're really getting good at this. I think what you should work on is the speed of your jacks. Although, how exactly does one make their earlobes go faster? Do yours have muscles or other additional body parts? How do you even move them anyway? Some people can wiggle their ears, so is it like-mmph."

One of said jacks pressed against his lips, halting his speech. "Thought I'd stop you before you did that for the whole train ride."

"Right, s-sorry."

Kyouka sat up in her chair relaxed into it, "Nothing to apologize for. I need that big brain of yours."

Izuku pressed his lips together and slightly shook his head, "You don't really need me."

"What? Of course I do."

"I help, sure. But, a lot of this stuff you're just figuring out on your own. A lot of the moves you use on me you made yourself. You're really smart."

Kyouka scoffed, but didn't say anything in response to his complement. It wasn't that she didn't think she was smart...Oh wait, yeah she did. Instead, Kyouka changed the subject. "So, are you excited?"

"For what?"

"UA! School starts next week. You know, the school we've worked so hard for. The school you literally broke your arm for. The school you took the entrance exam without any powers for. Our dreams officially start next week, and you've barely even mentioned it."

"Of course I'm excited. I've wanted to go to UA since I was little. I guess I've just been distracted." Izuku put his head against the headrest and looked up towards the ceiling. "My life's been changing fast. I mean really fast. In the span of just over of month, I suddenly get a quirk, I talk to a girl for the first time, I-"

"Wait, what?"

"U-Uh, moving on. I get a best friend, I sang at a karaoke club, I get accepted into my dream school, *everything* with your parents, I'm learning instruments, I learned how to somewhat control my quirk, one thing after another, and now I'm getting hit by a girl and her earlobes while having pillows duct taped to my body. It's a lot to take in. In a good way though."

Kyouka nudged him with her elbow and joked, "I'm noticing a lot of that has to do with me."

"Yeah, actually. So much of it has to do with you," Izuku smiled warmly at her. Kyouka blushed, shaking her head. Just before she could deflect the compliment again, Izuku cut her off. "After meeting you I can't imagine my dream without you in it."

A small smile graced Kyouka's lips as she looked up at Izuku. "You've gotta stop flooding me with compliments. I'm not used to it."

"Sorry, but it's true. I really don't want to think about what school-life would have been like if I didn't meet you in Recovery Girl's office. I mean, I already made a bad impression on a tall boy with glasses during my exam. Obviously Kacchan already hates me. What if they were both in my class? I think I might be cursed. But, I'm just really happy that I'm going to have you with me."

Kyouka smiled, "Same here."

"...*Woooow*."

"What?!"

"I say all of that, and all I get is a 'same here'?"

Kyouka's eyes widened in panic. "Wh-? Well, I-" Kyouka stopped talking when Izuku's mouth ever so slightly twitched upward. Her smile came back and her eyes squinted at her friend. "...You little jackass."

Izuku looked at her sheepishly, "You're a bad influence on me."

"I'm pretty sure you mean good influence."

He sighed, but chuckled. "You're right. I do."

"Ugh, you're so sappy," Kyouka groaned as she leaned back into the chair. Knowing she was only joking, Izuku simply smiled and looked out of the train window and into the night. "I hope your mom isn't worried."

Izuku turned back to Kyouka, "Hm?"

"Your mom. It's pretty late, so I hope she's not too worried right now. Especially since our stop is closer to my home than yours."

Izuku shrugged, "It's fine. We've been out this late before. She knows that I'm with you, and as long as I send her a text every so often confirming that I'm alive she doesn't worry."

Kyouka laughed, "Confirming that you're alive?"

"Okay, she actually might be worried," Izuku said, laughing as well. His face suddenly looked a little somber, but quickly switched back to normal. "But, she worries about me every time I breathe. It'll be okay."

Kyouka wanted to comment on his sudden mood switch, but it was so quick that it could've been nothing. She let it slide,for now. The subject at hand, however…

"When am I going to meet her anyway?"

Izuku suddenly went a little stiff, "Oh, u-uh, I don't know. Why?"

"Come on, you've met my parents, much to my dismay. It's your turn to be embarrassed. Besides, she raised you, so she's gotta be at least somewhat as pure as you are."

Izuku fiddled with his fingers as he looked down at his feet. "I-I really don't know. It's just not something I've really thought about. Going to your house just makes more sense to me. More space, the instruments are there, your room isn't embarrassing like mine is either."

"...You do realize that by saying that I want to go to your house even more right."

"I do and now I regret everything." Kyouka laughed once more as the train finally left the station. The compartment was barren for the most part, only a few other people were sparsely spread out in other seats. Most of them on their phone or with headphones in.

"I know you said it's tough to share personal things with her. So, I can wait. However, I am going to meet her at some point. It's gonna happen," Kyouka said, pulling out her phone and plugging one of her jacks in.

Kyouka put her other jack near his temple like how she did at Recovery Girl's office when they first met. "Ready to Die" by Andrew W.K began to play. As the intense music kicked in and Izuku sat in a slight shock at the lyrics. "Hm...Well, I didn't expect that. It's not exa-"

\**Zzzzz\**

Izuku froze as he suddenly felt a weight on his shoulder and the jack on his temple fell down. He looked down to see Kyouka asleep on his shoulder. It was late, and training must've taken a lot of her. The real question was: "How the heck did you fall asleep to this music?" 

Obviously, he received no response from the resting girl. Izuku blushed, but he didn't freeze up as most would expect of him. Kyouka had slept on his back, so this was nothing compared to that.

It also helped that the beach wasn't the only time.

Not sleeping and Kyouka didn't exactly go well together. If she was really tired, her body simply clocked out until you woke her up or she woke up herself. They had a lot of training nights or simply hanging out until the stars were out. With the two usually being in close proximity to each other at all times, apparently her body had subconsciously decided that Izuku was its new favorite pillow.

***...~AIV~...***

**(15 Minutes Later)**

*'Okay, Izuku. Be...very...careful.'*

*\*Jab\**

"Ow!" Izuku rubbed his side where Kyouka had once again stuck her jack into. "I didn't even wake you up yet!"

Kyouka rubbed her eyes as she lifted her head off of Izuku's shoulder. "I could sense it. We're here?"

Izuku stood from his train seat and stretched his arms out. "Yeah. C'mon, I'll walk you home."

He helped Kyouka from her train seat, sleep clearly still in her system. Izuku gathered their bag and threw the strap over his shoulder. He led an exhausted and fumbling punk-rocker out of the train station and on to the sidewalk for a short walk to her home.

"You really don't need to walk me home."

"Maybe not, but I want to. Besides, you're exhausted and it's late. Who knows what could happen?"

Kyouka chuckled, "It's literally a five minute walk."

"I know. But, I've learned that a lot can happen in five minutes."

Kyouka yawned and wrapped her jacket tighter around herself, "I can handle myself."

"I just spent the last three hours getting beat up by you. Trust me, I know you can handle yourself. But, like I said, you're tired. Quirks and criminals make a scary combo."

"I guess I should've figured you were the protective-type. I guess it's just another testament as to why you want to be a hero." Kyouka's eyes suddenly widened at her own words. "Huh. I just realized something."

"What?"

"We've never asked each other why the other wants to be a hero."

Izuku's eyebrows rose in realization, "Wow, you're right. I guess it never crossed my mind, which is odd for me."

"I'll go first," Kyouka said as she put her hands in her pocket and looked down at her feet while she walked. "I want to make others smile, even when things are at their worst. I'm not like you. I don't think I could be classified as an optimistic. All I want is to make others feel the way you do, make them happy and smiling...like right now."

She chuckled seeing Izuku smiling at her from the corner of her eye. Every time Izuku thinks Kyouka just can't get any better, she threw something like that his way. "That's amazing."

"It was actually pretty tough when I first told my parents about it. I thought they would be disappointed in me for not wanting to become a musician like them, but they were very supportive," Kyouka responded and turned back to Izuku expectantly. "So…?"

"Oh! My reasoning is actually a little similar to yours. At least one aspect of it. Well, obviously you know about my admiration of All Might. When I was a kid he was just the coolest thing in the world to me. Of course his powers are awesome, but that wasn't what drew me to him and heroism in general. He would save people, risk his life, and still do it with a smile on his face. A smile that shows that everything will be alright, because he's there. A smile that no evil can bring down. Helping people, being kind to others...as soon as I saw it, it was everything I wanted to be."

"Even when no one has ever shown you kindness?"

Izuku shrugged, "I learned a long time ago that no man is born equal. And when you're born on a lower pedestal, the ones on higher up can spit on you much easier. It was...rough. Some days were really bad. I don't know. I guess I just didn't want to fit the cynical mold that most have. There were moments when I remembered that life wasn't completely terrible. Besides, now that I have you, life is actually great. The best it's ever been, honestly." Izuku turned to Kyouka to see her looking at him in shock. "...W-What?"

"You...You are a force of nature."

"Force of-? What do you mean?"

"I don't think there's anyone else on this planet that can still stay optimistic after everything you went through."

"Y-You just have to wake up everyday and hope things get better. Sure, sometimes it stays the same...sometimes it gets worse. But, it paid off. I woke up one day, got a quirk, passed the UA entrance exam, and I met you. It's a long road, but there's always something at the end of it."

"You really are a true optimist."

"Most people would call that an idiot."

Kyouka nudged his arm, "Well I'm not most people."

"That, you definitely are not."

Kyouka squinted her eyes and him with a smirk on her face, "Now what exactly is that supposed to mean?"

"Oh nothing." Sometimes Kyouka truly didn't believe that someone like Izuku could exist. She even doubted All Might was as optimistic as Izuku was whenever he wasn't being a hero.

The two finally approached the Jirou residence and made their way to the front steps. Kyouka climbed on to the first step and turned back to Izuku. "I've created a monster."

"What happened to being a good influence?"

"You're already the purest thing alive. Anything I do just corrupts you."

"That's not true. Not at all. I don't think you fully comprehend how amazing you are." Kyouka took in his words, and then looked down in thought. Maybe it was because she was so tired and her mind wasn't all there. Izuku didn't know. But, before he could turn around, Kyouka fell forward and landed against Izuku with her head on his shoulder and her arms around his neck. By fell, that meant she literally fell. Her toes were just barely on the front step of her porch, and Izuku was the only thing keeping her from falling face first on the concrete. "Why'd you do that?!"

Kyouka chuckled, "Because I knew you'd catch me. Just more proof that you're too pure. You're a really great guy. You know that, Deku?"

Izuku shakily put his arms around her, "I-I try to be."

"You're going to be the best hero. Screw what anyone else says." Tears began to flood into Izuku's eyes and a smile crept on to his face. "And, if anyone tries to tell you otherwise, give 'em this."

"...Wh-...Give them what?"

"Oh, right. You can't see it right now, but I'm pretending to flip them off."

Izuku laughed, "You really need to go to bed."

"Shut up, Pine Tree."

"And she's back." Izuku lifted her back on to the porch, but she kept him in place by putting her hands on his shoulders.

"I might be tired, but I meant it. All of it."

Izuku wiped his eyes and nodded. "I know. Thanks, Kyouka."

At that moment, Izuku found one more thing he liked so much about Kyouka. She might be tough, teasing, doesn't take other people's crap, etc. But, whenever she allowed it to show, or whenever she thought someone was in need, she was soft. Kyouka turned so warm and comforting. Of course, she was those things even when the situation didn't require it. From time-to-time she would slip-up and become affectionate. Or, perhaps "slip-up" was the wrong phrase. It was mostly because she truly was a naturally caring person. It just made Izuku feel special, because he knew it was probably a side of her that nobody else had seen yet, besides her parents.

"You're going to make an outstanding hero, too, Kyouka. We'll do it together."

Kyouka opened her front door and stepped inside before looking back to Izuku. "That's the idea."

With that, the door closed and Izuku was alone with his thoughts. The teen turned around and made his way back to the sidewalk to begin his journey home.

For the first time in his life, Izuku's couldn't wait for school to begin.

***...~AIV~...***

**(1 Week Later: First Day of School)**

"You have no idea how to tie that, do you?"

"..."

"Izuku?"

"Hm? What?" Izuku was shocked out of his stupor as he stood at the front door of Kyouka's house. His stupor definitely was not the result of seeing Kyouka in her school uniform and the fact that it looked great on her and showed off her slender porcelain legs.

NOT.

AT.

ALL.

Kyouka rolled her eyes and grabbed his tie, fixing it for him. "What am I going to do with you?"

"I know what you're going to do with him, and that's take a picture of your first day of school. Smile!" The teens looked to see Kyoutoku and Mika walk up to them with the latter pointing her phone at them. The camera clicked, and the mother looked down at the picture to see Kyouka simply looking at the camera with her signature bored glare, and Izuku with a nervous wobbly smile. "You know what? This is somehow the most fitting picture I could have gotten."

Their daughter groaned and turned Izuku around, pushing him out the door. "We're leaving."

"Have a good day!"

"Bye!" Izuku quickly yelled before Kyouka closed the door.

***...~AIV~...***

**(Some Time Later: UA Front Gate)**

The teens made their way to the train station, expressing their excitement for the start of school. Eventually, their destination was finally in sight as they walked through the front gates of UA High School. "We've been here before, but this time I actually feel excited and not terrified."

"Me too. C'mon, let's find our classroom." Exploring through the halls of the school, Izuku thought he was in a dream. Kids with all kinds of quirks were everywhere. Each one more fascinating than the last. Soon enough, the duo found the classroom they were looking for. Kyouka whistled at the sight before them.

"Damn. That's quite the door. But, the real spectacle is what's behind it. Let's hope it's not…" Kyouka slid open the door to see Bakugou being reprimanded by who she assumed was the boy Izuku mentioned. "...aaand it's the assholes."

"Maybe we can avo-...Oh no."

"What's wrong?" Kyouka looked back to see both boys were looking at Izuku. The tall one made his way over to the teens with very stiff movements, while Bakugou looked at Izuku with a mix of anger and confusion.

"Good morning! You and I have met before. I am Tenya Iida from Somei Private Academy."

"I-It's good to see you again. I'm Izuku Midoriya, and this is my friend, Kyouka Jirou."

Iida bowed to Kyouka, but turned back to Izuku. "Midoriya, during the entrance exam, you figured out the true nature of it while I did not. I apologize for my behavior towards you. You truly were the better candidate."

Kyouka leaned over to Izuku and whispered, *"What did you figure out?"*

*"I have no idea."*

"The plain-looking boy!" Izuku and Kyouka turned around with the former in surprise, and the latter with a quiet, low growl. "You got in! I should've known, since that punch was awesome. Thanks for saving me by way!"

"I-I should be the one thanking you for speaking on my behalf and all."

"Huh? How do you know about th-?"

"If you're here to socialize, get out now." All eyes suddenly shifted towards the door to see a haggardly-looking man on the floor, in a sleeping bag, and drinking a juice pouch. The class began to murmur about the man before quieting down as he stepped out of his sleeping bag. "It took you all 8 seconds to quiet down. To anyone else who's going to waste that kind of precious time, you can get out, too. I'm your homeroom teacher, Shouta Aizawa. Change into your gym uniforms and meet me outside. No dallying."

As the class began to move out of the room, Kyouka turned to Izuku. "You know this guy?"

"Hm...He looks kind of familiar, but I can't put my finger on it."

"You two." Both teens jumped in surprise as Aizawa spoke to them. "What did I just say? Move."

"Yes, Mr. Aizawa," they said, moving out the door.

***...~AIV~...***

*'Strange way to start the first day.'* Kyouka inwardly chuckled to herself as she undid the final button of her shirt. She grabbed the jacket of her gym uniform and was putting it over her tank top when she looked around the locker room.

She looked around at all of the other girls, who were also changing into their uniforms. She saw the girl with the black ponytail, and then the pink girl with their shirts off. Then, she looked down at herself. She sucked in her cheek and bit into it while scowling. She sighed under her breath, "God-damn it."

"What was that?"

Kyouka quickly turned to see Ochako looking at her at the nearby locker. "Oh, uh, nothing. Just thinking out loud."

"Ah, okay. You're Midoriya's friend, right? Uh, Kyouka Jirou, was it?"

Kyouka nodded, "Yeah. And, you're Ochako Uraraka, the girl he saved during the exam."

Ochako blushed and rubbed the back of her head, "Yeah, not my most shining moment. But, he was awesome! Took down that giant robot in one hit!"

"I've never actually seen him use his quirk like that. What was it like?"

"I was trapped under some rubble and the robot was gonna roll right over me. But, then Midoriya ran through the dust, and he jumped all the what up to the robot's head all the way above the buildings. He punched it so hard the head caved in, and the rest of it imploded in itself."

Kyouka smiled, "Deku's as heroic as they come. If only it didn't cause his arms to break."

Ochako looked at Kyouka confused. "Deku?"

"Oh! It's just my nickname for him...One of my nicknames. I actually have a ton of nicknames for him. I've lost count."

"B-...But, doesn't-"

"Deku mean useless? Sure does. Don't worry, to him it's not an insult. It actually means a lot to him."

Ochako nodded, "Hm, okay. I kinda like Deku, actually. Sounds cute."

"Don't call him that." Kyouka froze at her response. It came out quickly with no filter. "Uh…I-It's sort of our thing. Best friends and all that."

Ochako smiled, not catching the slight forcefulness Kyouka's initial response had. "No worries, I get it. I don't want to impede on your friendship or anything. I would like to be friends with you guys though."

After composing herself, Kyouka nodded. "Sure, that sounds great. We're not exactly the most social duo, so I'm glad making a new friend was easy. And, I should say thank you."

"For what?"

"For trying to give Izuku your points. He didn't need them in the end, but your gesture didn't slip his mind or mine. If he needed the points and you could give him yours, this is his dream school. He would've been thanking you for the rest of his life. I don't want to know what school would be like without him. So, thanks. Seriously."

Ochako blushed and shook her head. "It was nothing. It was the absolute least I could do after what he did for me."

Kyouka zipped up her jacket and began walking towards the door. "It was still cool of you. I'll see you outside."

"See yo-"

"And stop calling him plain." Before the brunette could respond, Kyouka slipped out of the door hitting herself on the head for letting another comment slip out.

***...~AIV~...***

The new class all formed a large group out at the field as Mr. Aizawa approached them. "Alright class, line up. It's time for public humiliation."

"...What?" The class asked simultaneously.

"Instead of wasting our time at the opening ceremony, we'll be taking a Quirk Apprehension Test. We'll be testing your skills through multiple exercises that you've done back during middle school. This time, however, you're allowed to use your quirks. Bakugou, since you had the high score during the entrance exam, you can be the first example." He tossed a softball towards the explosive blonde. "What was your softball pitch score in middle school?"

"Sixty-seven meters, or something like that."

"Stand on the platform and try it using your quirk this time."

"Using my quirk? Hmhm, don't gotta ask me twice! Katsuki did as he was told, smiling to himself as he got onto the dirt mound, chucking the ball as far as he could.

**\*** ***BOOM!!!\****

The softball was shot off like a cannonball into the sky, a smoke trail behind it. Mr. Aizawa's tracker beeped with a score of 705.2 meters. Shouta nodded, "Good. That's just an example of what you're all in for. Now, all of you head over to the running lanes. Fifty-meter dash is first."

Mina clapped her hands together, "This actually might be fun!"

Shouta lifted a brow towards the pink girl, "Fun? This isn't fun. Hero work isn't fun. It's dangerous, and the consequences of every action you take go into effect. So, how about this? Whoever scores the lowest is expelled." The class immediately erupted in defiance of the choice, but Aizawa quickly replied, "If you have no potential, then you should go home. No potential is a death sentence when becoming a hero. Now get to the running lanes."

As the class moved towards the track portion of the field, Izuku looked towards Kyouka. "Do you really think he'll expel someone on the first day?"

"Who knows? Don't worry though. We'll be fine."

"What makes you say that?"

With a smirk, Kyouka pointed towards the invisible girl, and a short grape-headed boy. "I don't mean to judge a book by its cover, but I think we'll be okay."

The students all took their turns as duos at the fifty-meter dash, with the most impressive being Iida at only 3.04 seconds. "Bakugou and Midoriya! You're up!"

Izuku grimaced, "Oh no."

Kyouka put her hand on his shoulder, "Hey, you've got this. Honestly, I can't wait to see the look on his face when he realizes you have a quirk."

"...He's gonna punch me."

She pushed him forward with a giggle, "Just go!"

Izuku shakily walked up to the starting line and got into a runner's position. Katsuki glared at him from the side. "H-Hi, Kacha-"

"Shut the fuck up," Katsuki responded nonchalantly, not even looking over to Izuku. 

"That's about what I was expecting."

Aizawa raised his timer, "On your marks!"

Izuku took a deep breath and looked back at Kyouka. She mouthed the words *'Kick his ass'* to him.

Well, Izuku found it as one of his sworn duties to never disappoint Kyouka. So…

Izuku breathed in as his skin began to glow, reddish-pink lightning sewing across his body until shifting into a bright green, bouncing and connecting back to his skin. Izuku rose his power until his body began to slightly sting. Even if it would slightly hurt, it would be worth it.

Katsuki whipped his head over to look at Izuku with wide eyes. "What the fu-?!"

"Get set!" Katsuki shook his head and readied himself, deciding on ignoring the anomaly to his left until he had won.

"Go!"

Izuku and Katsuki shot off from their spots. In only the first couple of seconds, it was clear that the Izuku was pushing ahead of Katsuki. Izuku crossed the finish line in only 3.76 seconds, and Katsuki at 4.13 seconds. Izuku stood tall and rubbed his arm, trying to ease the lingering sting in his body.

"DEKU!!!" Izuku swung around to see Katsuki rushing towards him, flashes and sparks emanating from his palms. "WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT?!?!?! WHEN'D YOU GET A QUIRK, YOU ASSHOLE!!!"

"I-I-!" Izuku couldn't think of a response, and he didn't need one. With glowing red eyes, Aizawa's scarf wrapped around the blonde, trapping Katsuki in his scarf and pulling him to the ground. The image caused something to finally click in Izuku's head, his eyes going wide as he gazed at his teacher, "Y-... You're Eraserhead!"

Ignoring him, Aizawa continued, "Enough! If I get another act like that out of you, then I don't give a damn about the scores. You'll be immediately expelled without question. Do you understand?"

Katsuki stopped struggling and grunted out through grit teeth, "Yes, sir."

Aizawa released Katsuki and motioned back towards the class, "Now get back in the group, both of you. Each of you on opposite ends. Jirou and Koda, you're up." Izuku walked back to the group with his heart rate up, and turned to see Kyouka trying to hold her laughter. Her amused expression made him feel calm, and Izuku couldn't help but smile a bit, too. "You enjoyed that, didn't you?"

"Just a little. Wish me luck." The events ran like normal for the rest of the time. With the training Kyouka had gone under in the past month, thanks to Izuku, she finished the dash in just under 7 seconds at 6.85 seconds. With his quirk, Izuku scored 89 kg on the grip test, and Kyouka actually managed 38 kg. They both passed the sandbox, and the other events went by without too much of a hitch. Izuku was scoring very well in every event. The only one that his quirk didn't really help with was the toe touch. He managed to speed through the side-steps and sit-ups.

Kyouka was extremely happy that her training was paying off. Her scores were far higher than they were at the beginning of her final year in middle school. Izuku's training regiment, as torturous as it was, really did work wonders in such a small amount of time. She had even managed one of the highest sit-up scores by jamming her jacks into the dirt ahead of her and using them to pull her up whenever she was beginning to tire. Soon, all that was left was the softball throw, excluding Katsuki. Kyouka had managed 82 meters by using her jacks like an old fashioned slingshot. Now it was Izuku's turn, and he looked nervous.

"What's wrong?" Kyouka asked.

"What should I do? If I use my full power, I'll get a great score. If I don't, it might not be enough."

Kyouka squinted at Izuku with confusion, "Dude, have you not been following any of your stats? You've gotten some of the best scores in the entire class on every single exercise. You'll be just fine taking the safe route on this one."

Izuku nodded and jogged his way up to the platform. It was simple. Just power up, wind back, have Mr. Aizawa grab your hand with his wrappings...wait. Izuku looked back at Mr. Aizawa in confusion. "Wh-?"

"What are you doing?"

"Um, th-throwing the ball, sir?"

"I've seen your test footage. You're not about to break your arm, are you?"

"No! No, I can hold back." Izuku tried to explain his situation. "You see, Mr. Aizawa, my quirk-"

"Breaks your bones, I know. I'm simply curious, is all. How much of your power can you actually use?"

"Not much...Um, do you *want* me to break my bones?"

"No, just trying to understand. I don't want a student who's either weak, or so strong he's completely useless. Dire situations could require you to use your maximum. And, then, even after that, you'll be useless. I hope during the school year to see you be able to control some semblance of your full power and not be a glass canon. Throw however you want, but consider that your first lesson."

Izuku looked back down at the ball and thought over what Mr. Aizawa said. *'He's right. Some situations will require my full power. And I'll have a max of two punches before I'm entirely useless. I need to know how to use my full power and still keep me in the fight. At least for a little bit longer...Or at least not break my arm entirely. Hm...entirely.'*

A lightbulb lit up in Izuku's mind, and he knew what to do. He pulled back his arm, his power flowing through his arm and up to his pointer finger. With all of the power his unpowered arm would allow, he threw the ball as hard as he could with his powered finger pushing off of the ball.

"SMAAAASH!" Dust and wind crashed into bystanders, causing most of the class to yelp in surprise as the ball was fired into the sky at blinding speeds. Whenever the shockwaves finally stopped, the class looked over to see Izuku standing with a broken pointer finger. The teen clenched his fist and looked over to Mr. Aizawa who raised his tracker to show off the number of 705.3 meters. "Mr. Aizawa, I'm not sure about you, but I think this counts as some semblance of my power."

For the first time that day, Mr. Aizawa smiled. "Pretty sure I just said *not* to break your bones. It was just supposed to be something to think about."

"...O-Oh."

"But, I suppose I can't be mad at the initiative. Head to the nurse's office. Get that fixed up."

"Can I see the scores first?"

"If you think you're up to it." Izuku nodded and walked back to the class. Many of them began to compliment him, much to his embarrassment. But, Izuku was really only focused on two reactions. Kyouka was looking at him completely dumbstruck, but was smiling. And Katsuki also looked dumbstruck, but looked like he might murder someone.

Yaoyorozu walked up to Izuku with freshly created medical tape. "Here, Midoriya. Just until you get to Recovery Girl."

"Oh! Th-Thank you!"

"I'll take that." Both turned to Kyouka, who took the tape and began wrapping it around Izuku's finger. She looked at him with a wide smile. "That. Was. *Awesome.* Stupid, but awesome."

Izuku smiled back, "Thanks. It was painful, but worth it."

"Really?"

Izuku seethed in pain as Kyouka secured the tape around his finger, "Nope. Not at all. Why did I do that?"

Kyouka laughed as Mr. Aizawa walked over to the scoreboard. "Here's the final scores. Remember, these are averaged out, not added-up. "

He clicked his remote to show off the names and numbers.

**Izuku Midoriya**

**Momo Yaoyorozu**

**Shoto Todoroki**

**Katsuki Bakugou**

**Tenya Iida**

**Fumikage Tokoyami**

**Mezo Shoji**

**Mashirao Ojiro**

**Ejirou Kirishima**

**Mina Ashido**

**Kyouka Jirou**

**Ochako Uraraka**

**Koji Koda**

**Rikido Sato**

**Tsuyu Asui**

**Yuga Aoyama**

**Hanta Sero**

**Denki Kaminari**

**Toru Hagakure**

**Mineta Minoru**

Izuku's jaw dropped when he saw his name at number one. Kyouka was surprised by her number, in a good way. Katsuki had a vein bulging on his forehead. And, Mineta dropped to his knees and screamed, "NOOOOOOOOOOOO-"

"By the way, no one's getting expelled."

"OOOOOOOooooo...What?"

Aizawa deviously smiled, "It was a logical deception to make you all do your best. Well, we're done here. You have some forms for you back in the classroom, and the teachers for your other classes will be in eventually. Midoriya, go fix that finger."

With that, Aizawa began to leave the grounds. For a second, Izuku thought he saw All Might at the gate, but when he looked back he was gone. Izuku's attention was grabbed by Kyouka when she put her hand on his arm. "C'mon, Cabbage Patch. Let's go get that finger fixed. I suggest we move before Baku-Bitch can't hold himself back any longer."

Izuku looked back at Katsuki, and the blonde looked like he was about to explode. Pun not intended. "We should run." 

***...~AIV~...***

With his finger fixed, Izuku was now at lunch. He had managed to avoid Bakugou since the tests, and he was likely not to act up in public after Aizawa's warnings. So, at least he was safe for now. He left the lunch line and searched the room for Kyouka. His eyes finally landed on her, and she saw him. The two began to walk towards one another, only for Izuku to be dragged by Kaminari towards a different table, and Kyouka to be dragged by Mina to a different table.

Izuku was dropped down at a large table where the 1A boys, minus Katsuki and Shoto, were sitting at. He looked back at Kyouka to see she was in a similar situation, being forced to sit with all of the 1A girls. "U-Uh, why did you drag me here?"

"Because…" All eyes shifted towards Mineta, who sat at the head of the table with Kaminari and Sero at his side . "...we have a very important matter to discuss. It involves the 1A girls."

The rest of the boys looked around in confusion. Sato raised his hand, "What about?"

"...We need to discuss just how hot they are."

"Ugh./No./I'm leaving." Those were the general words from most of the boys as they got up and proceeded to leave the table. Izuku, Sero, Kaminari, and Iida still sat at the table. Izuku stayed because he didn't know what to do. Iida stayed to reprimand the purple-haired boy.

"Mineta! That is vulgar and inappropriate conversation!"

Kaminari shrugged his shoulders, "C'mon Iida. Lighten up a little. We're complimenting them!"

"No, it's harassment!"

"So it's harassment for me to say that I think Uraraka is hot?"

"In this situation, yes!"

"Pfft...Wait, is it really?"

Mineta patted his friend's shoulder, "It's simply appreciating the females. So, who do you think is the hottest?"

Kaminari furrowed his brow in contemplation, "I dunno man. I wanna say Yaoyorozu, but Uraraka and Mina are really pretty, too."

Sero jumped in, "Asui and Hagakure are nice."

"You can't see her face."

"So? Still pretty."

"I...Fair point."

Iida shook his head, "This is despicable. C'mon, Midoriya. We shouldn't associate ourselves with such conversation." I

zuku agreed and stood up. But, as he was collecting his tray, Kaminari spoke up. "Who's the other girl? Purple hair? What's your opinion on her?"

Mineta shook his head, "Her? No, definitely not for me. A little flat-chested, too skinny. Not for me."

Izuku froze in his spot. His stomach began to bubble in a sudden wave of anger. He slowly turned his head to look at the three boys. 

"Midoriya?" Iida turned back around to look at his friend. This caught the attention of the three boys, who turned to see the most terrifying death glare they had ever seen in their lives. "Midoriya!"

Izuku suddenly jumped out of his stupor and switched his gaze to Iida. "What?"

"Y-...Your tray is broken."

Izuku looked down to see his tray broken completely in two, some of his food on the table. "U-Uh...I-I gotta go."

He quickly threw away the remains of his food, Iida's calls to him falling to the wayside as he made his way over to Kyouka's table.

***...~AIV~...***

**(A Few Minutes Earlier)**

"You wanna what?" Kyouka ask, in utter disbelief.

Toru bounced in her seat, "We wanna talk about the boys."

Kyouka, along with Momo, lifted their brows in almost agitated confusion. "Seriously?"

Mina waved them off, "Oh come on. It'll be fun. It's just light-hearted talk to break the ice. For instance, who here thinks Todoroki is the hottest out of the boys?"

"I'm not doing this," Kyouka said, standing from her seat.

Momo nodded and began gathering her items, "This seems inappropriate. I'll join you."

Mina grabbed on to their sleeves, keeping them from leaving. "No! Please stay! You don't have to participate, and I won't talk about Midoriya."

Kyouka stumbled for a second, but recovered. "Why would that matter?"

Mina and Toru looked at each other in confusion. "He's your boyfriend, right?"

"Wh-...I-...No!"

"Oh...You sure?"

"Wh-?! Yes!"

"Oh. Sorry, it just kinda seemed like it." Mina gasped, "Do you like him?"

"Of course I do. He's my best fri-"

"Don't you pull that. You know what I meant. It's not like I'd blame you. He's pretty *cuuute~.*"

Kyouka blushed, sputtering for a decent response, "We-"

*\*Snap\**

The girls all turned to figure out what the noise was, and they found Midoriya standing up at his table with his tray broken in half. They watched him look down in shock, awkwardly throw his food away, and start stiffly walking towards the door leading outside and motioning for Kyouka to follow him.

"I...I gotta go." Kyouka picked up her food and began following Izuku. Not without turning around and saying, "This isn't what it looks like."

***...~AIV~...***

Kyouka walked out the door to find Izuku sitting against the wall near the door. He raised his hand, "Hi."

"Hey." She slumped down next to him and leaned her head back. "First day not going as planned?"

"N-Not really. You?"

"Not in the slightest," she chuckled as she placed her food out in between them. "Alright, let's share."

"Oh, no. I shouldn't."

"I'm offering and you're hungry. I grabbed a second pair of chopsticks on the way out, anyway." Izuku smiled and reluctantly took them from her. "What happened over there?"

Izuku sighed, "They were being...boys. Hormonal teenage boys talking about girls. I guess I just really didn't like the conversation."

"Same here. But, I'm sure they're all nice enough people. It's the first day. Maybe someday we'll get better at this social stuff."

Izuku nervously laughed, "And if we don't?"

"I don't know about you, but I have a backup plan. He's this walking piece of broccoli that stutters, is super awkward, and yet can level a building in a single punch."

"And I have a punk rock friend who acts tough, yet can't stay up past 9 pm to save her life."

"Wooow!"

Izuku chuckled, "Was that good?"

"Not great, but you're getting there." The two then sat in comfortable silence eating their food. After awhile, Kyouka said, "We should walk to the train station with Iida and Uraraka. They're definitely the ones we're closest to at the moment."

Izuku nodded in agreement. "So, two new friends? That's two more than I thought I would make today." The two laughed and settled down once more. Soon, Izuku felt a weight on his shoulder. *'Did she seriously just fall asleep?'*

Izuku looked down, about to laugh, but paused when he saw Kyouka's eyes open. "Is this alright?"

"...Y-Yeah...definitely."

So, all in all, not a bad first day.

A pretty damn good one.
