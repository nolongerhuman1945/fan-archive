# The Discovery

It started, like most disasters, with something that seemed too good to be true.

Sam found it in the old antique shop downtown, hidden behind a stack of dusty books. A pocket watch, but like no pocket watch they'd ever seen. The casing was brass, intricately engraved with symbols that seemed to shift when you looked at them. And the hands... the hands didn't tell time. They spun in opposite directions, faster and faster, until they blurred.

"Hey, look at this," Sam called to their friends, who were browsing through old records.

Jake peered over their shoulder. "That's weird. How much is it?"

"Twenty bucks." Sam checked the tag. "Seems cheap for something this detailed."

Twenty minutes later, they were back at Sam's apartment, the watch sitting on the coffee table between them as the three friends—Sam, Jake, and Maya—stared at it.

"Okay, so it's broken," Maya said, reaching for it. "Big deal."

But the moment her fingers touched the metal, the room *shimmered*. For a split second, the furniture was different. The posters on the walls were different. Sam was wearing different clothes.

Then it was back to normal.

"What was that?" Jake whispered, his face pale.

Sam grabbed the watch, and it happened again. A flash of something else, something that wasn't quite *now*. They dropped it like it was burning, and it clattered to the table.

The three friends stared at each other, then at the watch.

"I think," Maya said slowly, "we just discovered something we shouldn't have."

But of course, that never stopped anyone. Especially not them.
