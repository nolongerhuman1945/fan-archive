# Chapter 7

Tokyo's Narita Airport at midnight felt like stepping into a neon fever dream. Aris followed Natasha through customs, both of them traveling under diplomatic covers that wouldn't survive serious scrutiny but got them past the bored immigration officers. Outside, humidity hit like a physical wall despite the October chill.

A car waited—black sedan, driver in a suit who didn't make eye contact. SHIELD local asset, probably. They climbed in without speaking.

"Briefing," Natasha said once they were moving.

The driver handed back a tablet without turning around. Professional. Aris liked him already.

The screen showed surveillance footage from the Tokyo facility—a converted office building in Shinjuku, surrounded by normal businesses, completely unremarkable except for the underground levels that housed dangerous artifacts. Security feeds displayed empty hallways, locked doors, everything normal.

"Last contact was six hours ago," Natasha explained, swiping through images. "Standard check-in, no problems reported. Then radio silence."

"Same pattern as the other facilities."

"Exactly." She pulled up a floor plan. "We're assuming the hunter's already inside. Question is whether they've reached the vault yet."

Aris studied the layout. Three underground levels, single access point through the building's basement. Easy to defend, easier to trap. "What about Kim? Any leads on his location?"

"SHIELD's had eyes on him for three months. He works at a gaming café in Akihabara, lives in a capsule hotel nearby. Keeps to himself, no friends, pays cash for everything." Natasha zoomed in on a photograph—Asian man, late twenties appearance, tired eyes behind cheap glasses. "He knows someone's watching but hasn't run. Either he's confident in his abilities or he's tired of hiding."

"Or both."

The drive took forty minutes, traffic thinning as they left the airport behind. Tokyo sprawled endlessly in all directions, a city that had learned to build upward when it ran out of sideways. Aris let his senses extend, mapping the electromagnetic topology. Millions of devices, billions of data points, the constant hum of a hyper-connected metropolis.

Finding one specific person in this chaos would be difficult.

Unless that person wanted to be found.

"There," Aris said suddenly. "Shinjuku district, moving east. Quantum signature matching Subject Zero parameters."

Natasha leaned forward. "You're sure?"

"As sure as I can be without direct contact. It's faint—he's suppressing like Torres did—but it's there." Aris closed his eyes, focusing. "He's moving deliberately. Not running, not hiding. Walking."

"Toward the facility?"

"Yeah."

They exchanged a look. This was either incredibly good luck or a trap so obvious it deserved appreciation for sheer audacity.

"Change of plans," Natasha told the driver. "Take us to these coordinates. Fast."

The sedan changed direction smoothly, merging into faster traffic. Aris kept his awareness locked on that distant quantum signature, tracking its movement through the city. Kim was definitely heading toward the SHIELD facility—no deviation, no hesitation.

Walking into the hunter's reach.

"He doesn't know," Aris said. "About the hunter, the other deaths. He thinks the facility's still secure."

"Or he's the hunter and we're about to walk into an ambush."

"Cheerful thought."

Natasha pulled her sidearm and checked the magazine with practiced efficiency. "I prefer prepared to cheerful."

They intercepted Kim three blocks from the facility. He stood at a crosswalk waiting for the light, hands in the pockets of a worn jacket, looking like any other salary man heading home late. But Aris felt the power radiating off him—suppressed, controlled, but unmistakably there.

The sedan pulled up to the curb. Natasha rolled down her window.

"David Kim?" she called in English.

He turned slowly, no surprise in his expression. Like he'd been expecting this.

"Took you long enough," he said. Also English, California accent. "SHIELD, right?"

"Get in the car. We need to talk."

"About the hunter? Already figured that out." But he opened the door and slid into the back seat next to Aris. Up close, his exhaustion was more apparent—dark circles, slight tremor in his hands. "You're Subject Zero. I can feel you."

"Aris. And you're walking into a trap."

"I know. That's the point." Kim pulled out a smartphone, showed them a message: *Come to the facility alone or Subject Six dies. You have one hour.*

Subject Six. James Park. If Webb's information was right, Kim's twin brother.

"When did you get this?" Natasha asked.

"Twenty minutes ago. I was already heading there to steal some equipment, figured I might as well spring whatever ambush they'd set." Kim's smile was bitter. "Didn't expect SHIELD to show up first."

"The hunter has your brother," Aris said.

"Had. James died three years ago. Cancer." Kim's voice stayed flat, emotionless. "Whoever sent this message doesn't know that. Which means they're working from old intelligence, probably Webb's files."

That was both good and bad news. Good because it meant the hunter wasn't omniscient. Bad because it meant they were desperate enough to use outdated leverage.

"We need to evacuate the facility," Natasha said. "Get the artifacts somewhere secure before—"

An explosion lit up the night six blocks away. Not massive—shaped charge, probably. The kind designed to breach reinforced doors.

"Too late," Kim said calmly. "They're already inside."

The facility's upper floors showed no damage. Whatever the explosion had been, it had happened underground. Aris and Natasha approached from the north while Kim circled to a service entrance on the east side. Splitting up violated about seventeen tactical principles but they were outnumbered and outmaneuvered already. Might as well embrace the chaos.

"Radio check," Natasha said into their encrypted channel.

"Clear," Kim responded.

"Clear," Aris confirmed.

They entered simultaneously. Aris took the main stairs down, weapon drawn, every sense extended. The building's electromagnetic signature showed disruption on Level Three—security systems offline, emergency power failing, and that distinctive quantum frequency he'd learned to associate with other Subjects.

Not Kim. Someone else.

The stairwell opened into a corridor that looked like a warzone. Walls cracked, ceiling tiles fallen, emergency lights flickering. And at the far end, the vault door stood open, torn from its hinges through application of massive force.

Aris moved carefully toward it, scanning for threats. Nothing. Just destruction and the fading heat signatures of energy weapons discharged minutes ago.

Inside the vault, chaos. Display cases shattered, artifacts scattered, and in the center—

A body. SHIELD agent, judging by the tactical gear. Desiccated, mummified, drained of all moisture and bioelectric energy.

The hunter's signature kill.

"Natasha," Aris said into the comm. "We have a casualty. Hunter's been here but they're gone now."

"Checking security feeds. Stand by."

Aris knelt beside the body, touching the agent's vest with careful fingers. The death had been recent—maybe ten minutes. And the energy drain had been thorough, professional. Not the desperate feeding Sarah Chen had done, but controlled extraction. Someone who knew exactly what they were doing.

A sound behind him. Aris spun, power gathering in his hands—

Kim stood in the doorway, holding a small device that glowed with faint blue light. One of the artifacts.

"Easy," Kim said. "I'm not the hunter."

"Then why do you look guilty?"

"Because I'm stealing from SHIELD and you caught me." He pocketed the device. "Resonance dampener. Only one ever made. I've been trying to get my hands on it for twenty years."

"Why?"

"Because I'm dying." Kim said it matter-of-factly, like discussing the weather. "Same way James died. The quantum restructuring makes our cells unstable—fine when we're young, fatal when we age. Cancer, cellular degradation, pick your poison. This dampener might buy me another decade."

Aris stood slowly. "You knew the hunter would hit this facility."

"Suspected. SHIELD's been losing assets all year. When I got that message about James, I figured this was my best shot at acquiring what I needed without fighting through all your security."

"Using yourself as bait."

"Using their trap against them, yeah." Kim met his gaze without flinching. "You'd have done the same."

Probably true. Didn't make it less reckless.

"The hunter's still here," Aris said. "They killed this agent, which means they're between us and the exit."

"Then we go through them."

Natasha's voice crackled over the comm. "Kaine, I've got movement on Level Two. Multiple energy signatures, heading your way fast. Whatever's down there, it knows you found the body."

"Copy that. Extracting now." Aris grabbed Kim's shoulder. "Can you fight?"

"Can you?"

They moved together, climbing stairs two at a time. Level Two was a maze of server rooms and storage—not designed for combat, which meant any engagement would be close-quarters and ugly.

Halfway down the corridor, Kim stopped abruptly. "Wait."

"What?"

"That's not one signature. That's three." He closed his eyes, concentrating. "Two are artificial. Drones or constructs, something powered by stolen Subject energy. But the third..."

"Is the hunter," Aris finished. He felt it too now that Kim pointed it out. A quantum signature similar to theirs but different. Hungry. Wrong.

The corridor ahead exploded into light.

Not fire—pure energy projection, the kind that turned matter into plasma. Aris threw up a barrier instinctively, catching the worst of it, but the heat still seared his exposed skin. Kim rolled left, returning fire with a pulse of electromagnetic force that shattered overhead lights.

Through the chaos, something moved. Two somethings—humanoid shapes made of crackling energy, no faces, no features, just walking constructs animated by stolen bioelectric force.

The drones Sarah Chen's files had mentioned. Created by draining victims and using their life energy as fuel.

One lunged at Aris. He caught it with his bare hands, felt the stolen energy trying to invade his nervous system, and pulled. The construct's power flowed into him like water finding a crack—souls screaming, dozens of victims compressed into fuel, and Aris had to consciously stop himself from vomiting.

The drone collapsed, inert.

Kim was fighting the second one, trading energy blasts in a lightshow that would've been beautiful if it wasn't actively trying to kill them. Aris moved to help but—

Pain exploded in his back.

Not physical. Quantum. Someone had latched onto his energy signature and was draining him, pulling power directly out of his cells.

Aris spun. Standing ten meters away, partially phased into the wall like a ghost, was a figure he recognized from Webb's photographs.

Rachel Goldman. Subject Zero-Eleven.

"Sorry," she said. Her voice resonated at multiple frequencies, human and not. "But I need your stability. Need to understand what makes you different."

She solidified fully and lunged.

Aris barely blocked the first strike. Rachel fought like someone who'd learned combat through survival rather than training—savage, efficient, no wasted movement. Each hit carried stolen energy, and Aris felt his power draining with every contact.

"Rachel, stop!" He caught her wrist, disrupted her nervous system just enough to slow her. "Webb sent me to help!"

"Webb lied!" She broke free, eyes wild. Glowing the same way Sarah's had, but brighter. Hungrier. "He told me stability was impossible. That I'd die if I didn't keep feeding. So I fed. I survived. And now I'm strong enough to take what I need from the rest of you."

She'd been the hunter all along.

Behind him, Kim shouted a warning. The second drone was down but Rachel had more—six of them phasing through the walls, constructs made from her victims, each one carrying a fragment of the people they'd been.

Aris made a choice.

He stopped suppressing his power and let it out.

Energy exploded from him in a controlled wave, not attacking but revealing. His quantum signature blazed like a beacon, showing Rachel exactly what he was—the stability she craved, the control she'd never achieved, all of it on display.

"This is what you want," he said. "Take it. See for yourself."

Rachel hesitated. Then she reached out, connecting their quantum signatures.

Information flowed both ways. Aris felt her hunger, her desperation, sixty years of barely controlled power. Felt the way her cells vibrated at incompatible frequencies, tearing her apart slowly. Felt the thirty-seven people she'd drained to stay alive, each death weighing on her consciousness.

And she felt him. Felt the discipline, the boundaries he'd established, the way he'd learned to negotiate with the power instead of fighting it. Felt the cost—the constant vigilance, the isolation, the knowledge that one moment of lost control could kill everyone around him.

It wasn't a gift. It was a prison he'd built from responsibility and fear.

Rachel pulled back, eyes wide. "You're not stable. You're just... caged."

"Yeah. But I'm alive. And nobody else has to die to keep me that way."

"I can't—" Her voice broke. "I can't go back to that. Feeling the hunger every second, knowing one day I'll lose control and kill someone I care about. It's too much."

"Then let us help you. SHIELD has resources, researchers working on stabilization. Sarah Chen's learning control. You don't have to do this alone."

"Sarah's in a cage. They'll put me in one too."

"Maybe," Aris admitted. "But it's better than becoming a monster."

Rachel looked at her hands, at the energy crackling between her fingers. At the drones surrounding them, each one a person she'd murdered for survival.

"I'm already a monster," she whispered.

Then she detonated.

Not an explosion. A release—every bit of stolen energy she'd accumulated, discharged all at once in an uncontrolled pulse that would level the building and everyone in it.

Aris had maybe half a second to respond.

He grabbed Kim with one hand, wrapped the other around Rachel, and pulled. Pulled everything—the detonating energy, the quantum signatures, the very fabric of space around them. Compressed it all into a point, into himself, absorbing a discharge that should have been impossible.

The world went white.

Then black.

Then nothing.

---

Consciousness returned slowly, bringing pain with it.

Aris lay on something soft. Hospital bed, based on the smell. Voices nearby—Natasha and someone else. Dr. Cross, maybe.

"—fourth time in two weeks," Natasha was saying. "He can't keep doing this."

"The alternative was letting Rachel Goldman destroy an entire city block." Dr. Cross's voice, definitely. "Mr. Kaine made the only choice available."

"He made the stupid choice. Again."

Aris opened his eyes. White ceiling, fluorescent lights. Medical bay, Triskelion most likely. His body felt like one massive bruise.

"You're awake," Natasha said. She appeared in his peripheral vision, arms crossed, expression caught between relief and anger. "Want to explain what the hell you were thinking?"

"Rachel was detonating. Someone had to contain it."

"And it had to be you?"

"I was closest."

"Bullshit. Kim was right there. You chose to absorb a quantum discharge that should've killed you."

"But it didn't."

"This time." She leaned closer, and he saw genuine fear beneath the anger. "You're not immortal, Kaine. Keep throwing yourself at explosions and eventually one will stick."

Dr. Cross cleared her throat. "I'll give you two some privacy. Mr. Kaine, you're on bed rest for forty-eight hours minimum. Try to follow doctor's orders this time."

She left. Natasha sat in the chair beside his bed, some of the anger draining away.

"How long was I out?" Aris asked.

"Thirty-six hours. Longest yet." She rubbed her face tiredly. "Rachel Goldman's dead. The discharge was too much—she couldn't survive releasing that much power all at once. Kim's fine, already checked himself out and disappeared. And you nearly died saving someone who'd killed thirty-seven people."

"She was one of us. Deserved a chance."

"She was a serial killer using her abilities to murder innocents."

"She was desperate and scared and failed by everyone who was supposed to help her." Aris shifted, wincing as movement pulled at sore muscles. "Webb created her, abandoned her, left her to figure out survival alone. We can judge her choices or we can learn from them."

Natasha was quiet for a long moment. "You care too much."

"Probably."

"It's going to get you killed."

"Also probably." He managed a weak smile. "But at least I'll die having tried."

She shook her head but couldn't quite hide her own smile. "Idiot."

"Yeah."

They sat in comfortable silence. Outside the medical bay, the Triskelion hummed with activity—agents moving through corridors, operations running around the clock. The world kept turning, indifferent to individual struggles.

"Four more Subjects," Natasha said eventually. "Four more people we need to find before someone else does."

"Five," Aris corrected. "I didn't tell Fury yet, but Webb's information included himself. Subject Zero-Twelve. He was the final test—adult volunteer instead of a child. The treatments worked but he developed cancer later. Thinks it's related to the quantum restructuring."

"You're saying Webb's dying because of the experiments he ran on children?"

"Poetic justice, some might call it."

"I call it not enough." Her jaw tightened. "Where are the other four?"

"Volkov—Elena—is probably dead or in Russian custody. Been missing since 1956. Maria Santos was last seen in Brazil in '79, completely off-grid. Torres is stable and willing to help. And—" He paused. "And I need to tell you something about Subject Seven."

"Kozlov. What about him?"

"He's not Subject Seven. That was a cover identity Webb used for the files." Aris met her eyes. "Subject Seven's real name is classified above Webb's clearance. But he knows they're in SHIELD. Working for you. Have been for years."

Natasha went very still. "That's not possible. I'd know if someone with those abilities was—"

"Would you? If they were suppressing their signature the way Torres and Kim did? If they've been hiding in plain sight their whole career?"

"Jesus." She stood abruptly, started pacing. "I need to tell Fury."

"After I'm cleared from medical. Forty-eight hours, remember?" Aris caught her hand as she passed. "Natasha. Whoever Subject Seven is, they've been working for SHIELD without incident. They're not a threat."

"They're a person with quantum manipulation abilities who's been operating undercover inside our organization. That's the definition of a threat."

"Or the definition of someone who just wants to do good work without being seen as a weapon."

She looked at their joined hands, expression complicated. "When did you become an optimist?"

"About five minutes ago. Trying it on, seeing how it fits."

"It doesn't suit you."

"Probably right."

But she didn't pull her hand away. Aris held on, drawing comfort from the simple human contact. He'd absorbed so much energy in Tokyo—stolen life force from Rachel's drones, her discharge, the quantum signatures of everyone in range. It would take days to bleed it all off safely.

Days of feeling those thirty-seven victims' last moments echoing in his consciousness.

"Tell me something," he said quietly. "Something good. Something that makes this job worth the cost."

Natasha settled back into her chair, still holding his hand. "Last month, SHIELD intercepted a human trafficking ring. Forty-three kids saved, all under twelve. We got them home to their families." She paused. "One of them wrote me a letter. Said she wanted to be a spy when she grew up so she could save other people."

"That's a good reason."

"Yeah." Her thumb traced absent patterns on his palm. "That's what I tell myself when the other parts get too heavy."

They stayed like that for a while, just existing in shared space. Eventually Natasha had to leave—briefings, reports, the endless machinery of SHIELD demanding her attention. But she squeezed his hand before going.

"Forty-eight hours rest," she said firmly. "Then we find the others."

"Deal."

After she left, Aris closed his eyes and tried to rest. But every time he drifted toward sleep, he felt Rachel's desperation. Her fear. The moment she'd chosen destruction over captivity.

He understood that choice. Understood it too well.

And somewhere out there, four more people faced the same impossible decision—control or chaos, prison or death, stability or hunger.

He had to find them before someone forced their hand the way Rachel's had been forced.

His phone buzzed. Webb's number.

*Rachel's dead. Your fault for offering false hope. The others need a different solution.*

*What solution?* Aris typed back.

*Find Subject Seven. They have the key to permanent stability. But you'll have to make them remember who they are first.*

*Who is Seven?*

No response. Webb had gone dark again.

Aris stared at the phone, puzzle pieces refusing to align. Subject Seven working inside SHIELD. Someone who'd suppressed their abilities so thoroughly even Fury didn't know. Someone who held the key to stabilizing the other Subjects.

Someone who'd forgotten they were ever part of Project Genesis.

This was going to get complicated.

Forty-eight hours passed in a blur of medical tests, Dr. Cross's therapy sessions about "savior complexes and appropriate boundaries," and Fury's debriefings about Tokyo. By the time Aris was cleared for duty, he'd memorized every ceiling tile in the medical bay and was ready to climb walls from boredom.

Natasha met him outside, coffee in hand. "For you. Figured you'd need it."

"You're a saint."

"I'm really not." But she smiled. "Come on. Fury wants us in his office. We might have a lead on Subject Seven."

They took the elevator up, neither speaking. The coffee was perfect—strong, bitter, exactly what Aris needed. Small mercies in a complicated world.

Fury stood at his window, looking out over the Potomac. Maria Hill sat at his desk, tablet in hand, expression professionally neutral.

"Agent Romanoff. Mr. Kaine." Fury turned, single eye sharp. "We've been analyzing personnel files against the timeline Webb provided. Looking for anyone who joined SHIELD between 1953 and 1960, displays unusual capabilities they shouldn't have, and has been covering their tracks."

"And?" Aris asked.

"We found someone." Hill pulled up a file on the holographic display. "But there's a problem."

The photograph showed a man in his late sixties, gray hair, kind eyes. Someone's grandfather, by appearances.

Someone Aris recognized.

"No," he said. "That's not possible."

"Agent Phil Coulson," Fury said. "Joined SHIELD in 1989. Exemplary record, trusted by everyone, currently assigned to our Enhanced Individuals task force." He paused. "And according to genetic analysis we ran against Genesis subject markers, he's Subject Zero-Seven."

The room tilted slightly. Aris grabbed the desk for support.

"Coulson can't be a Subject," Natasha said. "He ages normally. No enhanced abilities. He's the most regular agent in SHIELD."

"Which would be the perfect cover," Hill countered. "If you wanted to hide in plain sight, you'd suppress everything that made you different."

"Or," Aris said slowly, "someone went into his mind and made him forget he was ever enhanced. Made him believe he was completely human."

The implications of that hung heavy.

Fury crossed his arms. "You're saying Subject Seven had their memories altered?"

"I'm saying someone with the right abilities could rewrite neural pathways. Make a Subject Zero forget they were ever part of Genesis." Aris thought about Rachel's desperate eyes. "Might've seemed like mercy at the time. Give a child a normal life instead of making them a weapon."

"Or it was containment," Hill said. "Lock away the most dangerous Subject by making them forget their power exists."

"Either way," Fury said, "we need to know which. And we need to know now, before whoever's hunting Subjects figures out that Coulson's one of them."

"You want me to break the mental blocks," Aris said.

"Can you?"

"Maybe. If I connect our quantum signatures, I might be able to trigger memories. But—" He hesitated. "If someone deliberately buried his enhancement, forcibly accessing it could break his mind. Turn him into another Rachel Goldman."

"Or," Natasha said quietly, "it could give us the key to stabilizing the others. Webb said Seven had the answer."

The trolley problem, updated for the quantum age. Risk one person's sanity to potentially save three others. Or leave them all to suffer and die.

"Where is Coulson now?" Aris asked.

"On assignment in New Mexico. Following up on unusual energy signatures in the desert." Fury pulled up a map. "We can have him back here in four hours."

"Don't." Aris straightened, decision made. "Don't tip him off that we know. I'll approach him in New Mexico, make it look accidental. If he realizes we're investigating him, he might run."

"Or attack," Hill added.

"He won't." Natasha's voice carried certainty. "I've worked with Coulson for years. He's not violent unless absolutely necessary."

"Let's hope his enhancement doesn't change that." Fury dismissed the holographic display. "You leave in two hours. Romanoff coordinates, Kaine does the actual contact. Get me answers."

They left the office. Aris's hands were shaking slightly. The coffee helped, but not enough.

"You okay?" Natasha asked.

"No. But I will be." He finished the coffee, tossed the cup in recycling. "I'm about to dig through a colleague's brain looking for buried memories. That's not something you prepare for."

"Need backup?"

"Always. But not in New Mexico." He met her eyes. "If this goes wrong, if Coulson destabilizes, I need you coordinating evacuation. Get everyone away from ground zero before I have to do something drastic."

"Like absorbing another quantum discharge?"

"Like that, yeah."

She grabbed his arm, grip tight. "Listen to me. You don't get to be the hero every time. Sometimes you let other people take the risk."

"When those other people can absorb city-destroying explosions, I'll let them." He covered her hand with his. "But until then, it's me. That's the deal we signed up for."

"Didn't sign up for anything. You got voluntold."

"Details."

Natasha pulled him into a hug. Brief, fierce, over before he could properly respond. Then she was moving down the corridor, all business again.

"Two hours, Kaine," she called back. "Don't be late."

"Wouldn't dream of it."

He watched her go, then headed for the armory. New Mexico in October would be cold at night. And if Phil Coulson really was Subject Zero-Seven, there was no telling what memories might surface when Aris opened that door.

Or what might come through with them.
