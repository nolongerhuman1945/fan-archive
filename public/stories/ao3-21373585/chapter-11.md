***...~AMP~...***

Izuku sighed as he closed the door to his apartment, quickly shedding his backpack and blazer to set them on the row of hooks near the door. He didn’t bother taking off his shoes, knowing he would be leaving again for Kyouka’s house in only a few minutes. Although, that would likely be delayed if his mom was ho-

“IZUKU!!!” The teen was quickly dragged into a crushing hug by his mother, his breath almost leaving his lungs. “The school called, I was so scared! Are you hurt!? Did they-”

“M-Mom! Air!” Inko’s eyes widened in realization, quickly releasing her son as Izuku coughed and sputtered. “I-I’m fine. I wasn’t hurt, everyone made it out just fine.” He figured that it was probably better not to mention that he was almost killed by Nomu. Izuku knew that if he told her that, there was no way he would be leaving his apartment that night. “It was just a scare. Most of the villains were just thugs, we fought them off pretty easily.”

“You fought them!?”

*‘Uh-oh...’* Izuku needed to make his escape as casually as possible. If he didn’t start now, his mom would keep him there all night coddling him. Izuku began to calmly undo his tie, moving through the living room and towards his bedroom door. “I-I mean, what was I supposed to do?”

“Run away!”

Izuku frowned as he opened his door, throwing his tie on his bed and beginning to unbutton his white shirt.  “There were dozens of them, and there were only two Pros on site. I had to fight. Everyone was in danger.” 

“But, what if you were hurt? Or worse!”

Izuku shook his head, throwing on a black shirt. He decided on keeping his black slacks, saving more time. “I-It’s not like I want to get hurt, but I’m training to be a hero. It’s basically in the job description. And, like I said, we fought them off just fine.”

“You shouldn’t play around with your life so loosely!”

“I’m not. I’m jus-”

“Honey, I know it must be so exciting to have powers after all this time and you’re finally achieving your dream. But, while you may have a quirk now, you only just got it. You just started school. How do you even know how to fight? A quirk doesn't suddenly mean you're invincible."

Izuku wasn’t particularly sure why he said what he did next. At least, he didn’t know why he chose then of all times. Maybe it was the stress of learning he had an all-powerful enemy out to destroy him. Perhaps it was the pressure of telling Kyouka that he was serious about her and wanted to make them official as a couple. Or, maybe his feelings had finally just bubbled over for a second after all the years. It really didn’t matter, because he still said it.  
  

“Well, despite what you’ve thought for the past eleven years, I’m not made of glass.”

Both Midoriyas froze, their eyes both wide at Izuku’s sudden outburst. He didn’t yell, but his voice raised with a sharp tone. What was he supposed to say? He had never gotten angry with his mother, at least he never let it show. It was a completely new experience for both of them.

“...Kyouka is expecting me. I-I gotta go.” Izuku quickly grabbed a green hoodie, speed-walking past his mother and exiting the apartment. Inko never even had time to respond before the door was closed behind her son.

Izuku ran down the stairs, his heart pumping loudly in his ears. That had escalated far too quickly for his taste. Once Izuku reached the sidewalk he stopped with his hands on his knees, taking deep breaths to calm himself down. It wasn’t often that Izuku slipped. His emotions were the one thing he always kept in check, or at least that’s how it had used to be. Now that he had Kyouka, someone who he could talk to about personal things, his floodgates were open. He had held so many things back over an eleven year time period that everything was pouring out at an alarming rate. 

Izuku’s original plan was he would keep all his emotions bottled up in one place, and then one day he’d die.

Simple, effective, painful, but necessary during his time alone.

But, he couldn’t just revert back to his old plan. The feelings of dread and loneliness still plagued his mind constantly, but Kyouka kept them at bay. Just one of the many wondrous effects she had on him. And, Izuku had a feeling that she wouldn’t let him close up again. Especially when she could read him like a book. Even if he tried to keep to himself like he normally did, it would take Kyouka 0.5 seconds to figure out something was wrong.

***...~AMP~...***

**(Kyouka’s Room: Exactly 0.5 Seconds After Izuku Walked Through the Door)**

“What’s wrong?”

Izuku raised his hands up in exasperation, “How?”

Kyouka almost laughed, it really wasn’t too hard for her. It didn’t take long into their relationship to realize just how strange Izuku was. After only a few months of knowing one another, she was already picking up on some of his habits. There were the obvious ones, like his muttering tangents, or his stuttering which increased the more nervous he was. He would click his teeth together or rub his chin when he was in deep thought, too. 

Or, at least most of the time.

There were these times when Izuku would just kind of...stare. Simply just gaze at nothing for small periods of time. It wasn’t during times when he was thinking about quirks, school, etc. He always had this look, too. Kyouka began to worry once she realized why the look was so familiar to her. It was the same look he got whenever his past was brought up. The bits and pieces he had given her, which was admittedly very little, already made it clear that it was a subject he would rather avoid all together and never speak of again.

He looked almost afraid whenever it was brought up. Then, when the topic was successfully avoided or passed, there was a split-second where his eyes just looked vacant. Luckily, she was usually there to bring Izuku back from where his mind wandered. But, it looked like something happened while she wasn’t around, causing him to walk through her door looking like someone had just taken his favorite All Might figure away.

Kyouka swiveled around in her desk chair to face Izuku fully. She wore black jeans with a long black cardigan over a red t-shirt. “You’re a book I read everyday, Deku. I’ve memorized a lot of parts.”

Izuku scoffed amusedly, closing the door behind him. “I-It’s nothing big, just...Okay, a little big.”

Kyouka deadpanned, “Coming from you, that means it is a big deal. What’s up?”

Izuku sighed as he sat on the edge of Kyouka’s bed, “I just got a little mad at my mom.”

Kyouka mentally grimaced, remembering the conversation they had on the train that morning. “Was it related to what you talked about this morning?”

“...A little.”

Confused, Kyouka stood up and made her way to Izuku, sitting down next to him. “A little?”

“I-It didn’t start that way. She was just really scared about what happened today. I mean, that’s fine. Obviously she’d be scared. But, then she was terrified when I told her that we fought the villains.”

“Well, that should be obvious.”

“Y-Yeah, that’s what I said. It’s what we’re learning to do. But, she kept saying how I could die and that I shouldn’t have fought. She thinks I’m not being cautious enough, that I believe I’m invincible now that I have a quirk. Like I’m getting too caught up in the moment.”

Kyouka chuckled, “Well, until recently you did just kinda break your bones willy-nilly without even thinking about it.”

“She doesn’t know that, so that couldn’t have been a part of her thought process. I jus-”

“Whoa, wait. Back up. She *doesn’t* know that your quirk breaks your bones.”

Izuku’s mouth opened and shut repeatedly as he tried to think of what to say. “I-...W-Well…”

“I thought you said you didn’t share personal things with your mom. Do you not tell her literally anything?”

“I tell her important things.”

“Breaking your bones on a daily basis seems pretty damn important, Izuku. Why would yo-?”

“Because she’d make me stop,” Izuku interrupted her. 

Kyouka's brow raised in confusion, "...Breaking your bones?"

"No, being a hero. If she knew, she’d pull me from UA in seconds. She may believe in my dream now, but that doesn’t mean she believes in *me*.” His gaze fell to his lap as he sighed. Kyouka remained silent, merely listening to Izuku as he vented. It was good, he was getting more frequent for him to really share things with her. Was it hypocritical for her to want him to let it all out when she kept so much in herself? A little. But, she wasn’t important right now. “When she said I thought I was invincible, I said...I-I said...I said despite how she thought of me, I’m not made of glass. And then I left.”

Kyouka took his hand, placing her other on his back. “...That 'small personal disconnect' with your mom that you mentioned isn’t that small, is it?”

His eyes saddened before he answered. “I’ve been a shut-in most of my life. On the outside...and in my own home.”

How much did Izuku have swirling up in his mind? Or in his heart? He was under a complete lockdown, and had been for years. Apparently, Kyouka was the only one with unlock code. She grabbed his cheek, turning his face towards her’s. “Is this because I brought it up this morning? I’m so sorry if I-”

“No! No, not at all. I think those are just words I’ve been thinking about for a while, and I made a slip. I guess after all these years my pressure popped for a moment. Unfortunately, this small misstep has likely caused the next few nights at home to be very awkward.” He gripped Kyouka’s hands back, “Please, don’t feel guilty for my mess. If anything, at least feel happy realizing that you’re the only person I’ve ever let get close to me. I doubted I would ever share this much to anybody, but then I met you.”

Kyouka shook her head, but a smirk was clear on her face. “You just always have to turn things into a way to woo me, don’t you?”

“Unintentionally, but I’ll take what I can get.” They laughed at the joke, the atmosphere lightening just a bit. Izuku leaned in, placing a light, hesitant kiss against Kyouka’s lips.

“Hey, no distractions.”

“Damn.”

“Is it really that hard to talk to your mom?”

Izuku shrugged, lying back on the bed. “Ever since that day eleven years ago, yeah. It’s not just with her either. With everything at home, and then school...school being a whole different level of awful, I sort of just closed up. Thoughts, feelings, wants, needs...I just kept it all to myself.”

Kyouka laid down next to him, placing her head on his shoulder. They were getting better at the moments of small physical affection like that. Just like the emotional moments, they were taking baby-steps with the physical things, too. “You said I was the only person you ever allowed to get close to you. Why? Besides the Power of Boners, I mean.”

Even though he blushed profusely at the joke, Izuku broke out into laughter. “W-Well, I guess I can’t deny that played a part. But...I don’t know. I think I saw an opportunity, one I just couldn’t pass up. I managed to keep an entire conversation with you in Recovery Girl’s office, something I’ve never been able to do with anyone. At least, not a casual conversation. Even conversations with my mentor just sort of turn into talking about big important things and my quirk. With you I just felt...happy. When you actually seemed interested in seeing me again, I realized just how sick and tired I was of being alone. After everything that happened with Kacchan, I can’t say I’ve ever had a legitimate friend until I found you. And, while I can’t say I would’ve shared so much about myself so soon if Kaachan and his friends hadn’t shown up at the mall, I’m glad he did. Having you know about it immediately lifted a weight off of my shoulders. I-I didn’t want my first real friendship to begin with lies and secrecy. One way or another, it also led to that evening at the beach a couple days ago. So, no regrets here.”

“...I’m going to hit you for being so damn charming.” Izuku chuckled, keeping his gaze up at the ceiling. “Has your mom ever tried to be close to you?”

“She tries everyday. But, as we’ve gone over, I’ve never opened up to her...Which just makes me feel so much worse. Why did I get so mad? She was only worried about me.”

“I mean, I understand where she’s coming from. And my parents would, too. They were all over me when I got home, but you said she was treating you like glass. Maybe it brought back some memories. Did she always treat you like you were fragile because of your quirklessness?”

Izuku sighed, “I don’t think she meant to, but yeah. She was always scared I was going to get hurt. Whether it was just being scared for her son, or being scared for her son because he was quirkless, the feeling remains the same.”

Kyouka rolled to her side, looking down at Izuku. “I get it. I hate feeling weak, too. It makes you feel useless, which is something you’ve heard your whole life. It definitely doesn’t make it easier coming from your own mom, even if she didn’t mean it that way. Is there anything I can do to help you? I know she doesn’t even know anything about me besides the fact that exist, but maybe I can be there when you talk to her again?”

“No. Not yet anyway. I just probably threw her the biggest curveball she’s had in a long time. Suddenly throwing you into the mix isn’t how I want to go about it. I want to introduce you on the right terms at the right time.”

“When are you going to talk to her then?”

“I...don’t know. I-I honestly just figured I’d sneak into my room through the window from the fire escape...which I am now realizing is locked.” Izuku groaned, covering his face with his hands. “Today has been too much. I don’t think I can handle trying to soothe things over with her tonight. I need to wait until she falls asleep or something, but I just...I-I can’t. Not now.”

Kyouka found it ironic that Izuku would jump into danger at a moment's notice, but can’t handle a single emotional talk with his mother. Although, she couldn’t exactly blame him. Being personally closed-off from your mom for eleven years and then suddenly having to have a deep, emotional conversation with her would be daunting, if not downright terrifying. Izuku likely had no idea how to go about it. She knew what it was like to just not be able to share your hidden feelings, especially about yourself. The feeling of choking up when trying to talk with people was all too familiar with her.

“I can at least help you in one way. If you’re seriously not comfortable going home tonight, you can crash here.” Izuku’s eyes widened, his blush coming back tenfold. 

*\*Jab\**

“Ow!” Izuku quickly rubbed the spot on his side where Kyouka had sent her jack. 

“Get your mind out of the gutter. I meant on the couch downstairs.”

“O-Of course! I wasn’t thinking I-”

“Yes, you were. Look, I’ll run it by my parents without sharing too much about the reasoning. We don’t have school for a few days because of the attack, so I doubt it’ll be a big deal. My parents, despite being extremely nosy, will respect your privacy about this. As long as I explain it’s a private matter, they won’t pry.”

"Are you sure? You already helped me so much just by letting me talk about it. I don't want to be a bu-"

Kyouka interrupted him with a quick peck on the lips. "Shut up. If you call yourself a burden I’ll punch you. I will say that while I promise I won’t give specifics, it’s gonna be hard to avoid the topic switching to your mom. I’ll keep it vague, I swear.”

“O-Okay. Thank you...for everything.”

“It’s no problem. Besides, think of it as a sleepover. Something that I can assume we both have zero experience in.”

“You would assume correctly.”

“Perfect.” Kyouka headed for the door, ruffling Izuku’s hair as she went. As soon as the door was closed, Izuku threw his arm over his eyes. That had definitely been...good. At the very least he felt better than before. Just a little bit less weight to carry on his heart. Kyouka didn’t push too hard, she understood how he felt, and then decided to help him further...

Kyouka was a godsend. 

After such an emotionally draining beginning to the night, it definitely wasn’t a good idea to try and throw asking her to be his girlfriend in the mix. Especially since he wanted that moment to be the best it could be. With both the USJ and his outburst with his mom, it just wasn’t his day. He couldn’t risk that bad luck merging with his first romance.

But, he still needed to be with Kyouka for the time being. While he still felt terrible about what had happened between him and his mom, Kyouka helped him feel better about it. And, now he just needed her to get his mind off of everything happening in his life. 

It just so happened that Kyouka was more than happy to help.

***...~AMP~...***

In the Jirou household personal recording studio, Kyoutoku scribbled down on a piece of paper while Mika sipped on her tea. It was fairly standard with the mixing table and recording booth, but it got the job done for any sudden bursts of inspiration they had while not at work. Black walls, red soundproof padding, it was cozy. Kyoutoku said, “Okay, we have all the standard questions down. Future, goals, et cetera. Now, what else can we ask him to prove his worth?”

“Favorite color.”

Her husband looked up at her with confusion, “Seriously? Why does that matter?”  
  

Mika smiled, “What if he says his favorite color is violet?”

“...Ooooooh.”

Mika patted his cheek as the door to the studio opened to reveal their daughter, her usual glare trying to mask nervousness. “Hey, guys? There’s something I gotta ask you, and you can’t say no.”

Both parents raised their brows, looking at one another and then back at Kyouka simultaneously saying, “We make no promises.”

“Izuku is having some personal problems and needs to stay here tonight.”

Mika immediately grew concerned, barreling questions at her daughter. “Is he having trouble at home? Did something happen to his mother? Is it about the attack today? Was he hurt?”

“Whoa, okay. No...well, yes...Look, it’s nothing really bad or anything. No one is dead, or going to die. It’s nothing that won’t be fixed. Izuku wasn’t kicked out, he left on his own with the intention of going back, and I was the one that made the offer. Call it an emotional dispute. There wasn’t even a screaming match or anything. It’s just that he wants some space right now.”

“Space from everyone, but you?” Kyoutoku asked.

“We all know why I’m the one he wants to be around.”

“Fair enough.”

“So…?”

Mika nodded, “Of course. You know we love Midoriya.” Kyoutoku lifted a finger to comment on that, but quickly received a glare from both women, silencing him immediately. “We know how much you care about him. He’s brought a light to you we’ve never seen before. If he really needs a place to stay, he’s welcome here.”

A small blush grew on Kyouka’s face, but she smiled. “Thank you.”

“Although, while your relationship and its speed is none of my business and I do trust both of you, he better not be in your bedroom after midnight.”

“Mom!”

Kyoutoku quickly raised his hand high, “I second this! In fact I’d like to push it to eleven! Or ten! How about now? We could all just go to sleep. Four o’clock is a decent bedtime, right?”

Mika took his hand in both of hers, “It was a nice attempt, honey.” 

“Do I have any control in this house?”

The mother and daughter both asked, “Have you ever tried to gain any?”

“I-...huh...That’s a good point.”

Mika smiled, rolling her eyes as she turned back to her daughter. “Just tell him the guest room is open.”

Kyouka chuckled, “I told him the couch.”

Her father winced, “Ouch. Putting him in the doghouse this early? He didn’t even do anything.”

“Might as well show him now where he’ll end up if he messes up in the future,” Kyouka shrugged and leaned against the doorframe. Her eyes widened, realizing she had just implied sharing a bed with Izuku directly to her parents' faces. “Ah, w-well thanks again, bye!”

Quickly making her escape, Kyouka closed the door and speed-walked back to her room. She stepped inside, throwing herself on the bed next to Izuku. He raised a brow, "Consensus?"

“You can stay, and you have the choice between the guest bedroom and the couch.”

Izuku squinted at Kyouka, “You had no intention of telling me there was a guest room, but your parents said otherwise. Is that accurate?”

“Perhaps.”

Izuku chuckled, pinching the bridge of his nose. “Anyway, you said you had some gear ideas earlier.”

Kyouka gasped, quickly getting up and running to her closet. From her closet, Izuku could hear her rustling around as he pulled out his phone to send a quick text telling his mother that he'd be staying at a friend's house. “So, you know how I was using that sword at the attack?”

“The one you learned how to use by watching anime? Yes, I do.” Izuku jumped in surprise as one of Kyouka’s earphone jacks shot out of the closet and jabbed Izuku on the bed. “Ow! I-I forgot how long you can extend those.”

Kyouka’s voice rang out from the closet, “Valuable information you need to memorize for your future. Not to avoid them, but to remember you can’t escape me. Ah, found it!” Kyouka walked out of the closet holding a small tuning fork. “I realize that a sword doesn’t particularly fit my theme. So, what about a tuning sword?”

“A tuning sword?”

“Yeah. A big version of this thing, supercharged by my jacks. I can use the vibrations to destroy stuff, too….That’s not dumb, right?”

“That...sounds...incredible.”

A smile began to break out on the punk's face, “Really?”

“Are you kidding me? Can you hand me that tuning fork?” Izuku jumped up from the bed, quickly heading for Kyouka’s desk. He grabbed a piece of paper and pencil, beginning to draw bullet points on the side of the page.  Kyouka did as he asked, handing the item to him. Izuku drew a light outline of the instrument, turning back to Kyouka. “Any ideas?”

***...~AMP~...***

**(Twenty Minutes Later)**

Kyouka looked down at their combined sketch, satisfied with what they had done. She raised her hand for a fist bump, which Izuku returned with pride. "Nice. I'll send a request form to the Support Studio. Hopefully I'll get this in after the festival. Alright, your turn."

"My turn?"

"Yeah, we have to talk about that new power you used to save my life."

“O-Oh, that," Izuku shrugged, turning around in the chair. "I wouldn’t exactly call that a new power. I think it was just my normal power reacting differently or something.”

“...So, a new power.”

“I-...Yeah, I guess. But, I don’t even know how I did it. I just didn’t want you to d-...Get hurt.”

Kyouka leaned against the chair he was sitting in, slowly putting her arm around his shoulders. “I appreciate it. I’ll make it up to you.”

“No! You’re already doing more than enough by letting me stay here tonight.”

“That doesn’t make up for stopping that guy from doing the same thing he did to Mr. Aizawa to me.”

“It does to me, combined with agreeing to go out with me.”

Kyouka chuckled, moving to sit on the desk. “Well, we should think of something.”

“How are we going to make gear for an ability I can’t control?”

Kyouka nodded, leaning back on her hands, “Fine, but what about weapons?”

“I’m more of a brawler, but I'll think about it.”

Kyouka smirked, rolling her eyes. “You and that fanboy brain of yours.”

Izuku looked at Kyouka confused, “What do you mean by that?”

“I mean, first you make your costume an homage to him, and now you’re trying to fight like him.”

Izuku shrugged, “Well, my quirk is a body-enhancer. Fighting like that is what it’s meant for.”

Kyouka poked his forehead, “Ya know, for such a smart guy, you don’t use your brain that much. You can fight with more than just your hands and feet, as useful as they are. Especially since you can’t use your quirk at full power yet.”

“I-I...I guess so.”

“I get you’re a 'by the book' kind of guy when it comes to hero stuff. Not as much Iida, but still. How can you be so creative with everyone’s quirk except your own? I’m a musician, so I was raised to be creative. But, quirks are your specialty. I figured you’d be better at this than me.”

Izuku knew he couldn’t tell her why he was emulating All Might, besides being a fanboy. Being the successor to the greatest hero to ever live didn’t really make Izuku want to be that creative with his quirk. He was having enough trouble breaking his bones, he could focus on the details later. “I-I guess I’m not all that used to change yet. My quirk is already a big shift in my life as is, I didn’t think about it. Or, at least I was a bit too distracted trying to figure out how to not break my bones.”

“Alright, fair enough.”

“I'll consider the weapons. At least as a back-up plan. If we work together, maybe we can think of stuff we can both use.”

Kyouka stood up from the desk, patting Izuku's chest as she walked by. "You're getting better at listening to me."

"When do I *not* listen to you?"

"I'll tell you when I find out." Kyouka walked over to her bed to pick up her phone, looking back towards Izuku. "My parents aren't cooking tonight, so how about a repeat of last night? I'm paying for the food this time, and no this doesn't count as our second date."

"Are we going to watch 'Aliens' this time?"

"Not on your life, String Bean. You're behind on music lessons. Go ahead and get your fingers on those keys and show me what you remember from last time."

A warm smile spread on to Izuku's face as Kyouka began calling what he assumed was a pizza place. He knew some people would say too many distractions from your problems is a bad thing. But, Izuku had a counter to that.

How could any time spent with Kyouka be bad?

The answer: It can't.

***...~AMP~...***

**(Two Hours Later)**

With pizza boxes sticking out of the trashcan, the duo once again sat at the piano with Izuku trying his best. 

Kyouka nudged him, "You're getting better. You can almost play 'Heart and Soul' without mistakes. It's basic, but shows improvement. We'll get to guitar next time. I think you can handle two instruments at once."

"I hope so." 

"You'll do fine. You're you, remember?"

"Most people would say that's exactly why I won't be able to handle it."

"That just proves how little they know about you." Izuku took the complement, smiling at Kyouka. 

"They would still need to credit you as a teacher."

"The 'I had a great teacher' line? Do you just love spouting out cheesy rom-com dialogue?"

Izuku shrugged, "W-Well, it worked on you, didn't it?"

"Just because it did, doesn't make it your most admirable quality." 

"Well…" Izuku said, a blush blooming on his cheeks. "Is it working now?"

Kyouka knew what Izuku was really asking. Or, more appropriately, she knew what he was asking permission to do. Both of them were new at dating and socially awkward, so it went back and forth on who started the basic intimacy they were only just starting to figure out. Usually it was just who’s hormones got to them first. However, Izuku was getting bolder. Well, bolder was a strong word. Either way, she had to keep up as best she could. Besides, she could use a confidence booster from her favorite person.

"It never stopped." 

Izuku gently leaned down, brushing his nose against Kyouka’s. The musician closed the gap, taking Izuku’s lips with her own. She could feel Izuku sigh, relaxing instantly. Today had been stressful to say the least for both of them, but even more so for Izuku. Kyouka slid her arms up and around Izuku’s neck, while he did the same for her waist. His hands were shaking, but he kept them firmly on Kyouka. His nerves could go to Hell, he wasn’t going to ruin one of the only good parts about that day. They would break away for split-seconds, only to go right back to connecting their lips. It didn’t go beyond normal kissing, neither were ready for anything past that. 

That was fine with both of them. This would quench their thirst plenty.

Izuku softly pushed forward, leaning over Kyouka as she lowered closer to the bench they sat on. Which wasn’t a very big bench, so when Izuku tried to put his hand out to lean on he promptly fell off the seat, bringing Kyouka with him.

“...Ow.”

Izuku covered his face with his arms, failing to hide his embarrassment. “I-I’m so sorry.”

Kyouka chuckled, “It’s cool. Definitely not the worst or last embarrassing thing that’s going to happen to us during times like that.”

“You’re probably right," Izuku sighed as he stared at the ceiling. He suddenly felt something snake under his back, wrapping around his torso. He turned to Kyouka circling one of her jacks around him. “What ar-?”  
  

“We fell. Does that mean we’re done?”

“I-I…” A smile grew on Izuku’s face, happy that he hadn’t destroyed the mood. “...I guess not.”

He was dragged over by Kyouka’s jacks, allowing her to hover over him. They continued their business, both dreading the moment midnight struck when Izuku would have to leave the room.

It was an unspoken agreement between the two that they were going to spend that time wisely.

***...~AMP~...***

  
  

**(The Next Morning: Dagobah Municipal Beach Park)**

Izuku had woken up earlier than the rest of the Jirou household, opting to go for a morning run. He needed to clear his mind of his home problems, instead focusing on his (hopefully) girlfriend problem. He needed some assistance when it came to that.

However, the help he received was less than useful...

“Kyouka...I-I know we’ve only been on one date, but...I can’t wait anymore. I know I want this. More than anything, I want to be your boyfriend.”

“No.”

“Wha-? All Might, how is that supposed to boost my confidence?!”

Toshinori leaned back against his truck, the sea breeze wafting over them. “We need to prepare you for every scenario, including her saying no.”

“Okay, but...is the wig necessary?”

Toshinori gave him a mirthful look, tugging on a long purple strand of the wig. “You’re going to tell me this isn’t immersive?”

“Yes. Yes, I am. If we’re being perfectly honest, I’m more terrified than anything. I didn’t even ask for this, you showed up with the wig. Which means either you already had it, or you bought it before coming here.”

All Might chuckled, taking off the fake hair, “C’mon, it was just a joke. I thought you’d get a kick out of it, ease your nerves a bit.”

“I need to be nervous! The more nervous I am, the harder I think. I need every idea I can muster up for this.”

Toshinori furrowed his brow, smacking his lips together. “Have you, I don’t know, perhaps just considered asking her? Like a normal person?” Izuku merely looked at him with confusion. “Oh, right. I forgot who I was talking to for a second.” 

Izuku groaned, sitting down on the concrete with his legs dangling over the sand below. “I-I might just be jumping into this too quickly.”

“You’re really scared, aren’t you?”

Izuku shrugged, “I’m scared of a lot of things. But, right now I’m scared about how terribly I could ruin this relationship.” 

“What do you think you would do that would make Young Jirou not want to be with you?”

Izuku opened his mouth to respond, but stopped himself. He contemplated for a second before replying, “What if she learns too much about me, and then doesn’t like what she hears?”

It technically wasn’t a lie, but All Might would think he was talking about just One For All. He wasn’t ready to tell All Might that stuff. Or anybody for that matter. The fine details of his past were to remain under lock and key for the time being.

Toshinori sighed, his brow furrowing as he crossed his arms and looked out at the sunrise. “Don’t forget about what I said yesterday. Don’t let the burdens of this quirk control your life.When she finds out, I’m sure she’ll stay by your side.”

“When? Not if?”

“If you plan on seriously being with her, then it’s inevitable that she’s going to find out. It’s actually more likely that you’ll just tell her.”

“Wh-?! And you’re okay with that!?”

All Might gazed at Izuku with confusion, “Why wouldn’t I be?”

“You said not to tell anyone!”

“Young Midoriya, if Young Jirou is who you think will legitimately be your chosen partner and confidante, then you should definitely tell her. Now? No. Not to sound harsh, and I do believe you two will last, but during my time in high-school I watched dozens of relationships crash and burn in less than a month's time. It’s not my judgement call. It’s your life and your quirk now. You choose who to trust. If she’s the one, go for it. Speaking of *your* quirk, when you first arrived you mentioned a new ability? What’s that about?”

“I don’t even know myself. Shigaraki was about to touch Kyouka, and something just snapped in me. I exploded with power. Has that ever happened to you?”

“No, never. One For All has always come pretty easily to me, but never changing like that. By power, do you mean the electricity that you produce?"

"I think so. It felt like I had rubbed my socks on a carpet for ten years." 

Rubbing his chin, Toshinori contemplated what Izuku had said. "Welp, I'll be honest, I have absolutely no idea what this power is."

"Your help has been less than stellar today."

"Look, all I can give you are guesses I'm sure you've already thought of. So, what do you think?"

Izuku stood up, leaning against the railing overlooking the beach. "...I think maybe it's excess power. You don't have the lightning I do, and if you do it's nowhere near the same extent. Maybe it's because my body can't handle it like yours, or because I'm not as big and likely never will be. Either way, I think I can use it...once I learn how to control it, that is."

Toshinori’s phone vibrated, he checked the message and the time. “Ah, I have to go. You kids may be out of school, but us teachers are still stuck there. I’ll see you later, Young Midoriya. We'll continue this conversation later. Don't try to use your power alone. No need to cause any damages. Call if you need anything else.”

Izuku nodded, absorbing the advice he was given as All Might got in his truck and took off. Was it really that simple? Izuku thought he was supposed to take this secret to his grave, but now Toshinori was just telling him to blurt it out. Granted, he said to tell her when he was absolutely certain Kyouka was the one. But, she certainly felt like the one to him. It took him one date to figure out he wanted to make the relationship serious, and he was already taking the relationship seriously anyway. 

But surely All Might didn’t think Izuku was just going to do it that soon. 

*‘You can’t even figure out how to properly ask her to be your girlfriend, Izuku. One step at a time.’* And his first step would have to be figuring out how he was going to talk to his mother. He couldn’t avoid her forever, and he couldn’t keep leeching off of Kyouka’s parents. He was going to have to avoid all major details, keeping as much information withheld as he could. It would’ve been far simpler if he could just blame it on past frustrations about his quirklessness, but it was a direct accusation. 

He felt terrible for what he did, but he couldn’t take it back. And, even after Kyouka took so much weight off of his shoulders the night prior, he couldn’t just spill his guts to his mother. He just...couldn’t.

*\*Bzzt\**

*Kyouka: I woke up and you weren’t in the guest room. If you're working out at the beach tell me and I’ll join you. After that breakfast should be ready when we get back. My parents don’t work until later, so sadly they’ll be eating with us. We’ll just have to consider a practice run for tonight.*

Oh, right. Dinner with his hopefully future girlfriend’s parents. Just another thing to add to the list of “Things Izuku shouldn’t try to handle at the moment." He was going to break if things kept ramping up.

...Maybe he *was* made of glass.
