*20* *th* *November 1994*

The atmosphere in the Hogwarts' infirmary was tense.

Sirius glanced around the gathered group; Remus and Bill stood by one bed, guarding the unconscious elf laid out on the blankets; Dumbledore, Moody and Snape hovered at the end of the beds. He, Harry and Dobby had gathered next to Kreacher's bed where Helen Jordan was conducting a health assessment.

Jordan stepped back from the infirmary bed and sighed, lowering her wand. "I'm not an expert on elves but he's severely exhausted as far as I can tell. He used a lot of his energy to get back to Black Manor and transporting another elf alongside himself."

Dobby tentatively reached out and touched Kreacher. He snatched his hand back and pulled at his ear. "Moved through wards meant to keep all but blood out. Used Winky bound to the blood to fool them."

"Well, that would do it." Jordan said dryly. "I think he'll recover in time."

Dobby nodded enthusiastically.

Sirius guessed that he was confirming Jordan was right.

The doctor walked around the bed and they followed her over to the second elf, a female elf who looked rather too thin and abused.

"She is being Winky." Dobby confirmed. "The Crouch elf."

"I can't believe your elf actually found her, Black." Moody said, his magical eye whirling.

"Kreacher is very resourceful." Sirius admitted, glancing back with no small amount of guilt at the unconscious form of the Black family elf.

Jordan pursed her lips and her wand weaved in a familiar pattern as she conducted the diagnostic. "Hmmm. It's not good news." She said. "I can't say for certain because she's an elf and the assessment is meant for someone human, but it's telling me that she's taken something like a Draught of the Living Death."

"Ah," Dumbledore's expectant face fell, "how unfortunate. We had hoped to be able to question her on the whereabouts of her master."

"You have to admire his smarts." Moody said. "Knew she was a weak point so he took her out of the equation."

"But didn't kill her because the bond provides him with protection from being found by other elves." Remus sighed and whirled away to stare out of the large infirmary windows.

Sirius wondered if the callous treatment of the elf wasn't pressing some of Remus's werewolf buttons. It wasn't as though werewolves were treated any better.

"Poor Winky." Harry murmured. His wide green eyes were moving over the elf's battered body.

Sirius put a hand on Harry's shoulder to comfort him – or maybe himself. He cleared his throat. "Remind me; there's no antidote to the Living Death, is there?"

Snape sneered at him as expected. "If that is what this is. There are a few other draughts that it could cause the same long term catatonic effect. The Dark Lord knows all of them."

"Can you…" Sirius flapped his hand in a motion that he hoped said 'find out which potion it was.'

"Perhaps." Snape said sounding bored. "I would need some of the elf's blood to test and isolate the potion's properties." He met Sirius's gaze derisively. "However, there is no antidote for any of the potential potions."

Sirius raised his own eyebrow. "Then, you'll have to create one, won't you, Snape."

Snape was too much of a Slytherin to gape at him but Remus's muffled snort by the window and Bill's choked cough expressed their view of his outrageous suggestion. And he knew it was outrageous but it was necessary. They needed the antidote and to talk with the elf.

"Just like that?" derided Snape, his voice shifting up two octaves in incredulity.

"Oh for Merlin's sake," Sirius said, "you're a Potions Master, Snape, and as much as I think you're a crap teacher, I know just how skilled you are at creating potions. I know you're more than capable of creating an antidote."

"With what supplies?" demanded Snape. "Or are you expecting me to use the school's?"

Sirius rolled his eyes. "I'll supply you with whatever you need. Just make a list and give it to Remus."

Snape stared at him. "You're serious."

Sirius repressed the urge to be childish and make a name-related pun. "She could be the only way of finding out where Crouch Junior and the rest are hiding, so yes: I'm serious." He held Snape's gaze. "Deadly."

Snape gathered his robes around him. "Very well. I'll work on discovering what potion was used and creating an antidote."

Sirius nodded sharply in acknowledgement. He wasn't going to say thank you. He would rather walk over hot coals.

"Splendid!" Dumbledore clapped his hands and beamed at them both.

Merlin. Sirius repressed the urge to cover his face with his hands at Dumbledore's evident approval at him and Snape working together. He decided ignoring it was the better part of valour and headed back to the prone form of Kreacher.

For all of Kreacher's hard work since Sirius had become Lord Black, Sirius still harboured the memories of the cruelties Kreacher had perpetrated against Sirius as a child. Perhaps his mother had ordered it but Kreacher had been the one to execute the instructions whether denying him food or chaining him into the basement or…

Sirius shook the thought away. Sometimes he wondered if Lily and Hermione hadn't the right of it where elves were concerned. The bond between wizards and elves might keep the elves alive but it was too corruptible. His mother had used Kreacher as a weapon and so had Crouch with Winky – and on the other side of the coin, both Dobby and Winky had been abused by their so-called masters.

The bond.

He never wanted to acknowledge that there was a bond between him and his elves. He wanted to think of himself as an enlightened employer of them rather than the slave master that held their magical leash. But there was a bond and he was a slave master – a master with responsibilities to his slaves.

Kreacher had been magically exhausted following Sirius's order.

Sirius cleared his throat and placed his hand with the House of Black ring on Kreacher's chest. "Familius magicus donum."

Silver light erupted beneath his hand and Kreacher's body lifted from the bed a little as he absorbed the magic of the House of Black. Sirius held the position until Kreacher began to stir. He took his hand away and waited.

"A gift of magic?" Harry murmured beside him.

"Kreacher was injured in service to us." Sirius said quietly.

Kreacher's large eyes opened slowly and he breathed in deeply. His gaze flew to Sirius. "Lord Black." He attempted to sit up.

"Easy, Kreacher." Sirius motioned for him to remain lying down. "Rest. You depleted your magic quite badly retrieving Winky."

The elf shuddered. "She's being in the old London paupers' crypt, Lord Black, protected by old magic."

"How did you find her?" Moody asked bluntly.

Kreacher glared at him.

Sirius pinched the brow of his nose. "Answer Moody's question."

"I follows Winky's blood from Crouch house. Used it to enter bad wards." Kreacher waggled his ears. "Is hard sometimes to keep trail."

"Did the trail take you anywhere else?" Moody asked briskly.

Kreacher shook his head.

"I'll go tell the Rat Squad." Moody headed out of the infirmary.

It was probably too late to catch anyone there. No doubt the elf had been stowed there when the others had gone into hiding after the Crouch place had become untenable.

"You did good, Kreacher." Sirius said. "Go back to Black Manor and rest for the day. You can begin your usual duties again tomorrow."

Kreacher popped away.

"Thank you for releasing my patient." Jordan said dryly.

Sirius gave an embarrassed cough and shot Harry a betrayed look at his snort of laughter.

"What's going to happen to Winky?" Harry asked, gesturing back at the bed holding the battered elf.

"She will need to remain in close proximity to my work." Snape pointed out.

"I would suggest a small room for her here." Jordan sighed. "But neither Poppy nor I have the time to look after her and…"

"Dobby bes looking after Winky." Dobby offered immediately, daring a look at Harry, his ears drooping a little. "If Harry Potter is not minding Dobby looking after Winky."

"I think it's a great idea, Dobby." Harry said with a grin.

Dumbledore smiled benevolently. "Then it is agreed. Winky will stay in the infirmary and be looked after by Dobby while Severus attempts to heal her."

"It could take months." Snape warned.

"Then, we'd best let you get started." Sirius said, slinging an arm around Harry to direct him out of the infirmary. He jerked his head at the door, catching Remus's and Bill's eyes so they knew to follow them.

The walk to their rooms was quick but Sirius wasn't surprised to see Amelia and Rufus waiting for them by the portrait with Moody.

"You'd better come in." Sirius said giving into the inevitability.

He didn't object when Harry sat down with them to discuss the latest developments. He knew as much as he'd wanted to keep Harry away from everything, he had more right to be there than anyone.

"Moody's updated you?" Sirius checked.

Amelia nodded briskly from her place on one of the sofas; Rufus sat awkwardly beside her on one side, Moody on the other. Bill sat next to Harry on the other sofa, Remus perched on the arm. Sirius settled for standing in front of the fire.

"So we know Crouch went to London." Sirius summarised. "Is it possible that's where they're hiding out?"

"Anything is possible." Rufus shot back with an irritated scowl.

Amelia shot him a look that told him to behave. "London would be a good place for them to disappear into given it's one of the busiest wizarding places in Britain."

"And that's not counting muggle London which is a teeming metropolis." Remus added thoughtfully. "We could search London for years and not find them there."

"That's the truth of it." Moody agreed gruffly.

Rufus sighed heavily. "I'll have the Rat Squad check out the crypt tomorrow."

"I'll come along with them if it's OK." Sirius offered. "My animagus form is good at tracking."

"You were the best tracker the department had back in the war." Moody agreed.

"I'll come too? Sometimes the wolf picks up on scents." Remus offered with a mild mannered smile that said he was harmless really.

Rufus huffed out a breath but nodded. "Fine. You can come by the DMLE and meet up with Wood in the morning."

"You might need a curse-breaker." Bill piped up.

Rufus glowered at him.

"He's right." Amelia said, her tone rich with amusement. "Better Bill and Caro than someone who doesn't know the reason why we need to go poking in a crypt."

"I don't really have a choice, do I?" said Rufus with both busy eyebrows lowered.

"No." Amelia agreed cheerfully. "This is the best lead we have since the seaside cottage idea doesn't seem to be leading anywhere at all."

Rufus grimaced. "London isn't exactly much of a lead." He suddenly shifted to stare at Harry. "You're not coming, Potter."

Harry blinked at him in apparent confusion. "No, I kind of have school tomorrow. Although…" he looked at Sirius with a half-hopeful expression.

While Sirius might have let him sit in on the meeting, there was a line and Sirius was drawing it.

"You don't kind of have school tomorrow," Sirius replied firmly, "you *do* have school and you need to incorporate Remus's latest intelligence in your preparations for the first task on Wednesday."

Harry sighed dramatically and flopped back on the sofa.

"Besides," Sirius pointed out, "do you really want to go poking around a crypt? Dead bodies and bones and dirt and…"

"OK," Harry said hurriedly, raising his hands in surrender, "if you put it like that."

"That's the reason I like crypts." Bill declared with a grin.

"Good for you." Sirius said, amused as Harry's mock look of horror.

Rufus turned to Sirius. "Have to admit that it was a good idea sending your own elf after Crouch's. Shame she's out cold."

"Do you think Snape will be able to find an antidote for her?" Amelia asked.

Sirius shrugged. "I'm not his biggest fan but he is brilliant with potions."

"There was a reason why Voldemort held him in such high esteem despite his halfblood parentage." Remus said dryly. "If anyone can find an antidote, it's Severus."

"I don't disagree with either of you and you're both forgetting that the lad's got a point to prove," Moody said, "he'll create the antidote."

Amelia nodded slowly. "Good. If we can get to talk with the elf…"

"She won't tell us anything." Rufus said. "Her bond won't let her betray her master."

Sirius tapped the mantelpiece and said nothing. The spell his grandfather had taught him would work for a short time, he was certain of it.

Amelia got to her feet, prompting Rufus and Moody to do the same. "I'll see you at the Ministry tomorrow."

"I should get going too." Bill said once they'd left. "Oh hey." He nudged Harry's arm. "Thanks for talking with Ginny. I don't know what you said but apparently she's agreed to do the mind healing."

"You should thank Hermione." Harry replied. "She was the one who convinced me to talk to her." He pushed himself off the sofa. "She still hasn't convinced Ron."

The fallout of the attack on Hermione had been tremendous. All three had planned to prank Hermione because she was going out with Harry. Jessica had taken it a step further choosing a malicious spell rather than the paint that the girls had agreed upon. Both Ginny and Lydia, who had immediately ran to her brother to confess her part given the political implications, had been horrified by Jessica's spell but couldn't deny they'd planned the ambush together. They'd been lectured by the staff and their parents about their attitude regarding Harry and Hermione, and specifically about the stalking, which everyone admitted had they stepped in sooner might not have led to an attack. Since Jessica had been expelled, the other two girls had taken on board the seriousness of what had happened. However, Ron was giving his sister the cold-shoulder and silent treatment.

Bill winced visibly. "Don't remind me." He waved and departed.

"Moony," Harry asked, "which of the dragon types is the most dangerous?"

Remus startled as though he'd been thinking about something else entirely. "Hmmm? Oh, the Horntail is considered the most dangerous."

"Right," Harry said, "I'll look that one up first then, knowing my luck I'll be the one to get it." He wandered away to the stairs and left Remus staring bemusedly after him.

Remus turned to Sirius.

"He's not wrong." Sirius said, folding his arms across his chest.

But thankfully they knew what the dragon types were and that there were dragons. Hopefully it would be enough to keep Harry alive. That belief was with him the next morning when he met up with everyone else for the search of the pauper's crypt.

The Rat Squad was out in full and Shacklebolt and Tonks had been included since they were still leading the investigation into the missing pregnant Summers woman. With the inclusion of Remus, Bill and Caro, Sirius was reminded of the treasure hunt to find the ring. The conference room was packed. He felt a pang of loss that Harry was missing out but since he was also mostly relieved that Harry was missing out on digging through bones, he paid it no attention.

"Can we pretend for a moment that I'm in charge?" Rufus barked from the front.

Amelia raised an eyebrow from her place beside him but said nothing. It was very amusing how Rufus changed colours rapidly under her relentless stare though.

"Of this briefing." Rufus managed to get out after he'd turned purple.

Remus turned to Sirius with a look that Sirius hadn't seen since they'd both been at Hogwarts – mischievous and snickering; school boys making fun of a too fussy professor.

Sirius had to work hard to keep himself from giggling and he arranged his face into his best 'I'm listening' expression even though he wasn't because it wasn't like he didn't already know what was going to be said.

Tonks passed Sirius a note.

It was addressed to Remus. Sirius's eyebrows shot up. Really? He'd seen Tonks flirting with Remus at the family dinner after Sirius had pointed Andy at Remus's love life so she'd leave his alone but…really? There was a hell of an age difference and the whole awkwardness thing if romance didn't work out. Tonks wagged her eyebrows at Sirius meaningfully, turning them green then blue before they shifted back to her usual colour of pink. He guessed she was determined to follow through with her flirting and since Moony did need to get some fun in his life…

Sirius slid the folded piece of paper to his right and nudged Remus. Remus glanced at him and Sirius motioned with his eyes to the paper. Remus frowned. He shot a look at Tonks who was purposefully not looking at either of them. Remus glared at Sirius who raised both eyebrows because how was Tonks passing notes to Remus his fault? Well, beyond the whole throwing Remus at Andy and taking part in the passing of the notes thing.

Remus picked up the note, read it and turned an impressive shade of red.

Oh, Sirius was so going to tease him for that later.

"Does anyone have any questions?" asked Rufus loudly.

The room was silent.

"Director?" Rufus said politely.

Amelia shook her head. "I've nothing to add." Her gaze swept over the assembled team. "Except good luck."

Rufus banged his fist on the top of the desk and marched out of the room.

Wood, who had been placed nominally in charge of the search, got to his feet. "I'll organise our portkey. Everyone else get ready and meet back here in fifteen."

Sirius was ready and he knew Remus was too. They had both dressed for the occasion in black muggle jeans, black t-shirts and jackets that were warm but provided plenty of movement. Sirius didn't mind any of his outfit getting dirty or binned because he fully intended to bin every single piece of clothing after digging in bones. He put his feet on the table and leaned back in his chair to wait for the others to come back after changing out of their robes.

He hid his grin at Remus's embarrassment as Tonks swept past him with a bawdy wink.

"Don't laugh!" Remus remonstrated in a hiss. "You should see what she wrote." He pushed the piece of paper at Sirius.

"*Size doesn't matter to a metamorphagus."*

Sirius spluttered with laughter in the thankfully empty room.

"This is all your fault!" Remus said, hitting Sirius's arm.

"She's just having some fun with you, Moony." Sirius said soothingly. "Merlin knows you could use some fun."

Remus gave him a disappointed look. "Apart from how awkward it would be if things didn't work out, she's too young, Sirius!"

"Yeah, I kind of figured those would be your objections." Sirius preened a little at getting that right.

"You can't think this is a good idea." Remus waved the paper at him.

Sirius sobered up a touch and sighed, letting go of his want to tease Moony. "On the one hand, I think you and Tonks dating is hilarious and a bad idea, you're right. But Tonks is…she's brilliant and you'd have fun with her. And I think you'd force her to grow up a bit and that's not a bad thing." He held up a hand when Remus went to argue. "But it's not really any of my business."

Remus regarded him thoughtfully. "That's actually a very mature response, Padfoot."

"I've grown as a person." Sirius deadpanned.

"You have."

He said it with enough sincerity that Sirius knew he meant it which caused a warm achy feeling in his chest because Sirius might have always yearned for Remus's approval after the thing with Snape, and it always felt good to get it.

Remus sighed and shifted position in the uncomfortable conference room chair. "I think I might like someone else?"

Sirius raised an eyebrow. "Who?"

"Her name's Clara." Remus said. "She's one of the werewolves at the chateau. She's…we have a lot in common."

He schooled himself not to wince and swallowed the urge to press Remus for more details. "Well, if your interest is elsewhere, I'd tell Tonks before her pursuit gets…more direct and leaves her open to being embarrassed because she simply thinks you're playing hard to get."

"Right." Remus said. "You're right. I'll invite her out for coffee or lunch or something."

He looked terrified. Sirius patted him on the arm. "Good man."

There wasn't a chance to discuss it further as everyone piled back into the room and they took the portkey to the wizarding pauper's crypt.

They landed at the entranceway in a derelict cemetery on the East side of the River Thames. The white crumbling edifice that housed the steps down looked unsound. Two of the outside columns had crumbled, one was cracked. The stone door was wide open but cobwebs hung on the upper corners and over every surface of the bare inside. Whatever minimal decoration there had been, had long since eroded leaving an empty shell.

"Well, this isn't creepy." Tonks said brightly, breaking the silence.

"I've seen worse." Caro rejoined dryly.

Brooks cast a magical light ball into the air to illuminate the immediate area.

"Darren, Marina," Wood pointed at Cambridge and Ambrey, "you stay out here and keep watch. Keith, if you run some traces out here; see if we can pick anything up."

Brooks nodded.

"Bill, Caro," Wood motioned to them, "you follow after me," he turned to Remus and Sirius, "then you guys."

"Kingsley, Tim; you have the rear." Wood motioned at Shacklebolt and Chambers. "Tonks, you stay with the civilians."

"Fine with me." Tonks said as she manoeuvred in between Sirius and Remus.

Sirius gave Remus a sympathetic look but he focused his attention on falling into line behind Bill and not falling down the worn stone steps that led down into the bowels of the crypt. Wood sent up light balls as they went so the dark oppressive tunnel was well lit.

It still raised Sirius's discomfort level, bringing back the tickle of the memories he associated with Azkaban. The dank and decaying smell in his nostrils didn't help either. He shivered under his heavy canvas jacket and gripped his wand a little tighter. He initiated some breathing exercises that he'd learned during his time at The Valley clinic, because keeping himself calm was a good thing, and he resisted the pull to fall into Padfoot where the worst of his memories would be dulled and fuzzy.

It was a long trip downwards and when the steps finished, the tunnel opened out into the burial crypt. It ran for miles under London, backed onto the muggle sewers at some point, the river in other places. There was just enough room width wise for three men to stand shoulder to shoulder but the ground beneath their feet was grimy and the walls were filled with bodies and bones. Small creatures scurried in the shadows.

"OK, so is it just me," Tonks said as they walked further into the innards of the crypt, "or is it much creepier down here than upstairs?"

"It's always creepier when there are rats." Caro agreed with evident distaste.

Wood slowed as the crypt branched off. He raised his wand. "Which way?"

Remus weaved his wand in an archaic motion but Sirius could see him surreptitiously sniffing. "There's evidence of new blood that way." He pointed to the left.

"Kingsley, how about you, Tonks and Caro check that out?" Wood pointed to the right. "Just in case."

Kingsley, Tonks and Caro acknowledged the order and moved off.

The rest of them headed down the left branch of the crypt. It felt like they had walked for miles when Remus spoke again, almost shocking Sirius who had fallen into the lull of the quiet.

Remus sniffed again. "There's blood ahead."

Sirius shook himself, pulling his mind back to the present. "Fresh?"

"Yes." Remus said.

Bill cast ahead and grabbed Wood's arm as he went to move forward. "There are blood wards just around the next bend. Serious blood wards and a trip alarm."

Wood frowned in the dim light. "Let's keep our wits about us then."

They inched forward carefully around the corner and peered down the long tunnel until disappeared into darkness.

"Stop!" Bill ordered. He cast carefully. "It's a tricky trip alarm. It's been set-up to trigger some kind of signal to someone when something magical passes through it." He pointed with his wand. "It covers the entire tunnel like a force-shield." He frowned and reached into his ubiquitous back-pack, bringing out a wooden object.

It looked like a hollowed out square cube, Sirius mused.

Bill placed it on the ground and with his fingers gently nudged it into the ward. "It's non-magical so it shouldn't trigger the ward. I've left this far end outside of the ward so…" He aimed carefully with his wand and non-verbally cast at the cube.

The spell hit the cube outside of the ward. It grew rapidly until it almost filled the tunnel providing a safe way through for them. Sirius clapped Bill on the back.

"Clever." Remus remarked with relief.

"We should still proceed with caution," Bill said, although he flashed a smile at them both, "it's possible Kreacher already triggered the trip and we might have company."

Sirius considered the possibility and bared his teeth in a parody of a smile. "Let's hope so." He would love to get his hands on any of them – Peter, Crouch, Travers…

Wood shot him an exasperated look. "It'll be my arse on the line if you get injured."

"Don't worry," Remus said dryly, "Amelia knows what he's like."

Sirius harrumphed and froze at the sight of the wall coming up on his right. It was crumpled in the middle, debris falling into the tunnel along with a number of bones that were being chewed on by a couple of rats.

"Well, that's where all the blood is concentrated." Remus said, pointing towards it.

Bill took his time casting the diagnostics. "I have no idea how Kreacher survived busting through these blood wards except for the fact that he's an elf; they've been set-up to be deadly to wizards."

"Let's see if we can find a trail." Wood suggested.

Sirius nodded and raised his wand, beginning the tracking spells he had learned as a Hit Wizard.

Remus sniffed the air. "The scent of blood is overwhelming everything else but maybe I can track it if I get a good enough sniff." He wandered closer to the blood ward.

"Careful, Remus." Sirius cautioned him.

"It probably wouldn't kill me." Remus muttered, but he stayed back and Sirius counted it as a win.

He turned his attention back to the tracking spell and froze. There was a trace of recent magic; very recent magic; animagus magic.

Sirius cleared his throat carefully, his eyes seeking out the rats near the wall. One of them was almost right next to Bill; the other back with the bones close to Remus. He had a fifty-fifty chance of guessing correctly…

"Moony."

"Yes, Padfoot."

"Did you know that Ron discovered his animagus form?" Sirius asked casually, taking a step closer to Wood where he had an open shot of the rat by Bill's foot.

Remus froze, his eyes darting to Sirius's with the right question, and Sirius nodded almost imperceptibly.

Bill turned to look at them both quizzically.

"Nope, can't say I did." Remus stretched as though he was completely relaxed, his keen gaze taking in the position of the rats. He took a step back to give himself a clearer shot of the one close to him.

With practiced ease both of them spun in unison and yelled the spell to force an animagus back into human form.

The rat by Bill quickly formed into the visible shape of Peter Pettigrew.

But Peter was quick, already firing his wand at the ceiling and bringing a deluge of debris down that cut Remus and Bill off from Wood and Sirius who both had to take cover or get hit with the falling ceiling.

Sirius threw a cutting hex at him through the cloud of dirt and Peter squeaked as he threw himself sideways to avoid it but he couldn't quite escape it and it impacted his shoulder. He threw another expulso at them. Wood dived to one side, throwing up a shield in front of him, and Sirius dived to the other. The expulso ricocheted off the shield and into the wall behind Wood, causing it to fall and knock him on the head. He slumped to the ground.

Sirius coughed and cast another cutting hex.

Peter squeaked again, created a thick bank of fog even as he changed back into Wormtail, the hex flying over his head. He scuttled away into the dense grey mist.

Sirius cast a glance at Wood, and despite his want to chase after Peter, hurried over to check on him. "Wood?" He felt for a pulse and found one.

Wood coughed weakly and stirred at Sirius's touch, his eyes blinking open.

"Are you…?" Sirius asked quickly.

"Fine," Wood clutched at his bleeding head and motioned down the tunnel, "go!"

Sirius changed into Padfoot and scented the rat – there was a blood trail. Padfoot gave a howl of rage and Sirius fought hard to keep control of his form as he began the chase. Peter must have changed back, Sirius thought as he bounded down the tunnel. He would have caught up with a rat before now whereas Peter in human form could have gotten a good head start. He thanked Merlin that his animagus form had good night vision; the dark of the tunnel was oppressive.

He skidded to a halt at a junction; left or right…

He sniffed the ground anxiously and found a smear of blood to the left…but his nose pointed him right and he took off again.

The flash of a spell sailed through the air and Sirius leaped to avoid it, twisting to land on the wall with his back paws to rebound off it, adrenaline surging through him.

Peter was close!

Padfoot skidded around another corner and Sirius ducked hurriedly as another spell flew towards him. He snarled at the sight of Peter stood in front of a dead end; the lower two thirds a wall, the upper third iron bars covered with a metal mesh and the shimmer of the magical barrier that prevented magic from seeping through into the muggle world. The sound of rushing water beyond gave away that they'd reached the muggle sewer system; the glimmer of a shaft of sunlight flowed over the bars.

Sirius lowered his head and growled, preparing to pounce.

Peter changed rapidly…

Sirius jumped…

And Wormtail disappeared into a small hole at the foot of the wall.

Sirius just avoided crashing into it and he shifted back to human form, hitting the wall with his fist as he glared through the bars and mesh at the sight of Peter changing from his rat form to stare back at him safely on the other side, sunlight from a drain high above gilding his dirty form. Neither of them could cast anything because of the magical barrier.

For a long tense moment their gaze held.

Peter turned away…

"James loved you, Peter!" Sirius yelled. "How could you do that to him?!" He had loved Peter too. The betrayal cut deep and painful.

Peter's shoulders slumped as he stopped but he didn't look back over his shoulder at Sirius. "I told you the truth in the Shack, Sirius. I was scared."

The quiet rush of the sewer water almost made him inaudible but Sirius heard him.

Sirius placed a hand on one of the bars and levered himself up against the wall. "We were all scared, Peter. It's no excuse."

Peter laughed humourlessly. "You think I don't know that?" He shook his head. "It's too late now anyway. I made my choice."

"It's not too late." Sirius said immediately. "You don't have to do this, Peter! Do you…do you remember when Harry was born? Do you remember what we promised James, Peter? All of us standing around the crib the night they brought him home?"

They'd promised to protect Harry; all of them, every single one of the Marauders.

"The Dark Lord will kill him no matter what we do." Peter said eventually. He raised a hand to his hurt shoulder and winced as his hand came back bloody.

"No, he won't." Sirius argued fiercely. "Not if you do what you promised James in the first place and protect his son." He gave a harsh bark of laughter. "Harry saved your life in the Shack, Peter. You owe him."

"So that means I have to die for him?" Peter finally looked back over at Sirius. His round face was streaked with grime, his thinning hair askew. "I'm not you, Sirius! I'm not brave enough to put myself between the Dark Lord and a boy…a boy I don't even know."

Sirius banged his hand on the bar as Peter went to leave again. "That's a lie!" He shouted. "You know Harry, Peter! You know him because you watched him for almost three years as Ron Weasley's rat! You know he's good and kind and brilliant!" He searched desperately for an argument that would convince Peter to give himself up, hating that he couldn't just stun him. "He's defeated your Dark Lord three times in the time you've known him! He defeated him at eleven and he defeated a shade of him at twelve. Your Dark Lord fears him!"

"You might be right about that." He said tiredly.

"You know Harry can defeat him if you stop bloody helping him then!" Sirius said sharply. Come on, Wormy, Sirius thought; come on!

Peter faced him again and smiled sadly. "I've made my choice, Sirius." He straightened, catching and holding Sirius's furious glare. "I am the Dark Lord's willing servant, Sirius, just as Harry is his unwilling enemy." He touched his shoulder again, his voice dropping to a murmur that Sirius struggled to hear. "It will all be decided one way or another on the eve of the Summer solstice."

And Peter shifted into Wormtail before Sirius could do more than gape at him, scuttling away and out of sight.

Sirius slammed his hand against the bar once more and slumped against the wall. So close…he'd been so close…

"Padfoot!" Remus's worried yell shattered the silence.

Sirius gathered his composure. "Over here!"

Remus rounded the corner, wand out, covered in dust and the dark shadow of a graze on his cheek. Sirius straightened and pushed off the wall to go and check on him.

"Peter?"

"The rat went through a hole in the wall." Sirius grumbled as he grasped Remus's chin and tutted loudly at the injury. "You alright, Moony? And the others?"

"I took a bump to the head when the ceiling came down, but I'm fine. Bill's just a bit scratched up. We managed a bit of transfiguration work to get through the rubble. Wood's conscious but dizzy." Remus dismissed his concern. "You?"

His body ached; bruises and bumps and scratches making themselves known with the confrontation over and the absence of the adrenaline that had masked them during.

"I need a drink." Sirius said bluntly.

"Let's get back then. Caro, Tonks and Shacklebolt found the pregnant Summers woman in the other tunnel." Remus said. "It looks like they dosed her with whatever they dosed the elf with. Caro's trying to dismantle the blood ward to get her out."

Sirius brightened. That was good news. He cast a look back towards the muggle sewer.

"Merlin, Moony, I think I almost had him. He…" the words Peter had uttered before he'd ran off echoed in Sirius's head, "I think Peter's tried to help us."

Remus's mouth fell open. He shook himself. "What!?"

"I'll tell you all about it." Sirius promised, patting Remus's shoulder. "After I've had that drink."

o-O-o

*24* *th* *November 1994*

Harry was going to throw up.

He stared at his pale image in the bathroom mirror and swallowed hard.

He shouldn't have had lunch although he wasn't entirely certain that the two slices of bread and butter he'd managed to bolt down counted enough to warrant being called lunch.

"Harry?" Sirius knocked softly on the doorjamb and caught Harry's panicked eyes in the mirror. He immediately moved into the bathroom, resting his hands on Harry's shoulders and squeezing gently.

"I'm going to throw up and embarrass myself." Harry muttered. He tried another deep breath and let Sirius's warm hand on his back soothe him.

Sirius stayed silent as Harry got his nerves under control. He didn't try to give him meaningless reassurances or platitudes. They both knew Harry had to go and face a dragon; had to go and compete; had to make it look like he wasn't scared because to do less would be to give Voldemort the win.

Harry turned away from the mirror and leaned back against the sink as he lifted his glasses momentarily to rub his eyes. He dragged a hand through his already ruffled hair. "How long do we have before I have to go to the tent?"

"We need to leave in the next fifteen minutes." Sirius sat down on the edge of the bath. "Your friends are waiting for you downstairs. They want to walk out with you."

Harry nodded. They'd discussed it that morning during History of Magic. He was slightly wary of walking out holding Hermione's hand but the media storm about their relationship had died down with the escalation of excitement ahead of the first task. He worried someone would try something but Hermione was adamant that she wasn't letting Jessica's horrible attack on her interfere with them, and Harry knew Sirius intended escorting her to the stands.

He smoothed a hand over the thick robe he wore over thick canvas trousers and a black top. The robe was made of muggle fire-resistant material – even the crests on the front – and would hopefully keep him safe. He knew Sirius had commissioned it as soon as they'd become aware that he'd face a dragon. His boots were combat boots that Sirius had bought specially for him.

"You look good." Sirius said.

"I wish I could wear my invisibility cloak." Harry confessed with chagrin. The rules were clear that the Champions could only begin the task with one magical item; their wand.

Sirius hummed. "You have your plans sorted?"

They'd sketched out ways to deal with each dragon and Harry had to admit that it was good to have the knowledge in his mind before racing off to do battle. It felt unusual but good. Still, a part of him was waiting for the other shoe to drop because they really had no idea what the task entailed beyond facing a dragon.

"I'm set." Harry took a deep breath and pushed off the sink. He held a hand out for Sirius who raised an eyebrow at him.

"I'm not that decrepit." Sirius declared but he took the hand.

Harry gave an indistinct murmur. It hadn't quite escaped his notice that Sirius had come back bruised after his escapade into the crypt in London. It also hadn't escaped his notice that the physical wounds weren't as bad as the emotional. Sirius had told him about the conversation with Peter and it would take a long time before Harry would be able to shake the memory of how much pain had shimmered in Sirius's eyes. He was also shocked that Peter might have been trying to help them with the whole hinting about the ritual.

Peter aside, the trip to the crypt had led to the team saving Cindy Summers. She was still pregnant if in the same drugged coma as Winky. The theory was that Voldemort had her stashed away as a spare for the amniotic fluid. Snape had started working on identifying what potion had been used but the general consensus from everyone was that it was going to take time.

The other general consensus was that Voldemort and company were likely in London somewhere. That sent a shiver down Harry's spine. The thought that they were that close to so many people…Voldemort could do a lot of damage.

Still, Moody had been absolutely terrifying about security for the first task which Harry appreciated. The grounds were being patrolled by Aurors; the public was allowed nowhere near to the school, only to the stands and a large refreshment tent set up by the Lake, and then only if they had a named ticket. The school itself was on lockdown with all access restricted through the main doors. The likelihood of Voldemort gaining entry was miniscule.

Harry took another deep breath as he reached the bottom of the stairs and opened his arms for Hermione to hug him. He spent a good minute just appreciating the feel of her holding him just as tightly as he was holding her before they both inched away, hands sliding into a familiar hold.

They'd agreed to wait for their first date for their kiss.

It was something that Harry swung from thinking was a good idea (he did want it to be special and memorable for the right reasons) to thinking it was a bad idea (mostly because he was worried he was going to screw up and he just wanted to get it over and done with, and partly because he wanted to kiss Hermione).

"You look good." Neville offered by way of greeting.

"Very scary." Ron said.

"I don't think the dragon is going to be scared." Harry replied.

Sirius adjusted his own smart black robes and gestured for them to start moving. "We're going to be late if we don't get going."

They trooped out of the quarters and down the stairs, through the corridors and through the main entrance out into the cold wintery day.

It was sunny; a blue almost cloudless sky stretched overhead with the thin November sunshine lighting everything up brightly but doing nothing to counter the chill.

Harry ignored the flash of a camera and focused on striding purposefully towards the contestants' tent. He glanced over at the stands filled with the rest of the school and the public; at the arena that had been created in front of the Lake, the dragon pens backing onto the Forbidden Forest where they had been hidden for days. He caught sight of the judge's platform set to the side with the best view.

"Harry!" Bagman grinned at him with evident relief. "Good! We have all of our contestants."

Harry waved at Viktor, Fleur and Cedric gathered in a small semi-circle in front of Bagman.

Bagman registered that Harry wasn't alone and gave a false wince. "Lord Black, I'm afraid you and the students will have to go to the stands now."

Sirius gave a nod of acknowledgement. Regardless of Harry's minor status he wasn't allowed to be in a position to give Harry advice on the task once it was revealed. Harry didn't protest the brief hug Sirius pulled him into, and a hundred things crowded at the back of his throat.

"Good luck." Sirius said softly. "Do your best but I want you back alive, so unnecessary risks, OK?"

Harry couldn't speak for the lump in his throat and settled for nodding.

Hermione sprang forward when Sirius released him. She gave him another lightening hug. "Don't forget; you're a great wizard." She whispered in his ear.

Ron and Neville settled for manly handshakes and pats on the back along with their expressed wishes of good luck, and within moments Harry found himself standing alone. He shifted around Bagman to stand beside Viktor.

"Right!" Bagman clapped his hands and grinned at them. "The first task is difficult but I'm sure you'll all do well." He reached into a pocket and pulled out a cloth bag. "In here I have four small figurines of the creatures you'll be facing. You'll each go in turn and draw a figurine out of the bag and then I'll fill you in on the rest."

He shoved the bag towards Viktor.

"Harry should go first." Viktor said firmly. "He is youngest."

"I agree." Fleur said in heavily accented French.

"Me too." Cedric hurriedly said.

Bagman's face fell. "Unfortunately, that's not possible. We have to go in the order the Goblet drew your names."

"It's fine." Harry said quickly. "I don't mind."

Viktor gave a harrumph of disapproval at the decision, but reached into the bag. He pulled out the small figurine of the Welsh Green. Harry fought to keep the disappointment off his face because he'd wanted the Welsh Green. It was by far the most placid of the dragons.

Fleur was next and her hand opened to reveal the Hungarian Horntail. A small frown marred her face and Harry couldn't blame her for her consternation. The Horntail was considered to be the most dangerous.

Cedric's face showed his relief at not getting the Horntail as he reached into the bag and drew out a tiny Swedish Short-Snout.

Harry took the last figurine of the Chinese Fireball. It was the second most dangerous of the dragon types but the one best suited to his strengths. Red-scaled, lean and with a ferocious flame, it was deadly on the ground but had problems flying with its wings mainly for show. It was the one most closely related to a serpent compared to the other dragons who fell more into the lizard family as distant cousins.

Bagman ignored the lack of shock and horror, or maybe he put their lack of reaction down to deep shock. Harry shook himself as Bagman cleared his throat.

"So, the first task will be to get past the dragon and steal as many of the eggs in the nests they are protecting, moving them to another location within the arena. Contestants will be scored on ingenuity, spell-work and the number of eggs successfully collected. The more eggs you get the more clues you will receive for the next task."

Harry stared at Bagman, unsure that he had heard correctly.

"You vant us to steal the eggs of a movver dragon?" Viktor asked incredulous.

"Eet is barbaric!" Fleur tossed her blonde hair back as she glowered at Bagman.

"Want is not the right word." Bagman said, losing some of his false bonhomie. "This is the task that we've been given to do."

Right, thought Harry sourly; this was the task Voldemort had set so of course it was barbaric and cruel.

"You'll each receive one hour to complete the task. Viktor will go first, and then Fleur, Cedric, and of course, Harry, last but by no means least." Bagman recovered enough to smile at them all. "You cannot watch the others before you, you cannot confer on the task, and you will need to remain in the tent until I come for you. There is a magical barrier above the arena which will prevent anyone in the stands from helping you. Any questions?"

They all shook their heads. Harry's heart was sinking; he had to wait three hours?!

"Well," Bagman pointed towards the tent flap, "Viktor, shall we?"

Viktor straightened his shoulders, a grim expression on his face as he strode out. Bagman sauntered out in his wake.

Fleur made for the wooden chairs that had been set out at the back of the tent. "Mon Dieu!"

"You can say that again." Cedric said, wandering over to sit beside her.

Harry followed him for want of a better plan and sat on the other side of Fleur. "What are we supposed to do while we wait?"

"That's a good question." Cedric said. "They could have provided a deck of cards or something."

"Perhaps we are meant to spend the time devising our strategy?" Fleur mused, flipping her hair back.

"It doesn't seem fair to you and Viktor if that's the case," Cedric said, "you'd get a lot less time to plan than Harry or me."

Fleur gave a Gallic shrug. "I do not want to talk about eet. Let us talk of somezing else." She rapped her fingers on her thigh and shifted her gaze to Harry. "You know Beel?"

"Beel?" Harry repeated before sorting out the accent in his head. "Oh, you mean Bill." He got a sinking sensation. "Uh, yes? He's Ron's brother and he's in service to the House of Potter."

"He is…" Fleur sighed in a dramatic heartfelt way that had Harry seeking Cedric's gaze frantically only to get a 'I know it's horrifying' look back, "wonderful. Non?"

"Non, I mean, yes." Harry stumbled over his reply and nudged his glasses back up his nose. "Uh, he has a girlfriend?"

Fleur frowned heavily, her eyes giving away her evident disappointment at the news. "The woman who works with him 'ere?"

"No, that's Caro; she's just his work partner." Harry explained. "His girlfriend is Alicia Doge. They've been going out a while."

"Eet is a shame." Fleur sighed again. "I was so sure. He 'ardly felt the effect of my allure."

"Is that important to a Veela?" Cedric asked, curiosity getting the best of him.

"Oui," Fleur said dramatically, "eet is important to know if your lover loves you and is not enthralled, non? That eet is real."

Harry understood her point. He had rigidly stuck to his belief that it was important for his girlfriend to like him as Harry rather than as the Boy Who Lived or Lord Potter or whatever title they were sticking him with that week. He was so glad he had Hermione.

"Yeah," Cedric sighed, "sometimes I wonder if Cho only likes me as a boyfriend since I became a Champion. Our practice date was a bit awkward."

Harry cast about desperately for another subject. "Why don't we play I Spy?"

"I Spy?" Fleur perked up with interest. "I have never played eet it before."

Teaching wizards how to play the muggle game of I Spy kept them busy until Bagman returned to collect Fleur for her turn. Cedric and Harry wished her luck before retreating back to their chairs awkwardly.

Cedric cleared his throat. "What do you think about the news that Richard Gosforth is retiring from international Quidditch?"

Harry sent him a grateful look and they discussed Quidditch until Cedric begged off to think about his strategy until Bagman turned up for him.

It wasn't long before Harry was alone. He wondered how the others had fared. He felt cut off from the real world in the bubble of the contestants' tent. He didn't know if the others had managed to get any eggs, if they'd gotten hurt, or how well they'd scored.

Maybe that was a good thing, Harry considered thoughtfully. He should concentrate on his own performance and not worry about theirs. He turned over the strategy he'd worked out for the Chinese Fireball in his head.

Flying had been a central component. He'd figured he could summon his Firebolt and take to the air to get past the dragon. It was still a possibility but grabbing an egg from a nest would be tricky, then there was manoeuvring on the broom carrying a dragon's egg with an angry dragon trying to get to him. He knew his flying skills were good but Chinese Fireballs had a hell of a flame and they were smart and clever.

His back-up plan was weather related. The Chinese Fireball liked the heat and hated the cold. It was a good day for his back-up plan. There was already a chill in the air; he could work on that. If he made the Fireball cold and lethargic, he could disable it.

He bit his lip. What if he injured her giving her hypothermia? What if she died?

No…he wouldn't let that happen, but a dragon was too dangerous to leave capable of thinking and moving for his task.

There had to be a better way.

Bagman entered the tent and Harry's heart seized for a moment in his chest. Had it already been an hour?

"Your turn now, Harry?" Bagman said. "You, uh, you do have a plan?"

Harry looked at him guardedly. "Of course, Mister Bagman."

"Splendid!" Bagman beamed, his toothpaste smile even whiter up close. "Just through here…" They went through a long canvas tunnel and out onto a platform overlooking the arena.

And suddenly, the noise was deafening.

The arena was a square shape, not unlike a Quidditch pitch, but there was a pit below in the middle which had been transformed with grey rock and boulders to create a forbidding environment, like the sharp jagged landscape that Harry had once seen in a photo of a volcano. A large gate on the opposite side gave away the method of how they got the dragon into the pit. The Chinese Fireball was already present on the right of the arena under the Hogwarts' stand, chained but sinuously curled around its rocky nest filled with four crimson gold-speckled eggs. It was snarling at the noise, protective of its young.

Harry gulped down air and looked up instead into the stands.

He caught sight of the Gryffindors, ranged together with banners of support for him – but there were other signs in the other Houses; one prominent in Slytherin that Harry knew belonged to Theo and the Slytherins allied to the House of Black, another in Hufflepuff where Susan and Hannah stood, and one that glittered in Ravenclaw that belonged to Luna. The banners were duplicated in the public stands that curved behind him. There was a VIP box and he identified Cornelius and Arthur before he tore his gaze away.

He took a calming breath as he realised Bagman was doing a formal announcement, explaining he had to get the eggs over to an area marked by a small flag on the left under the Champions' stand which included the remaining visiting students from Durmstrang and Beauxbatons.

He searched out the faces he wanted to see: Sirius, gazing at him fiercely from the Champions box in the public stands, Remus beside him looking worried, Hermione between them with Ron and Neville close to the railing by Remus. His friends spotted him looking and waved to him, clapping and cheering. Sirius placed both hands on the railing, leaning forward, and across the distance of the arena their eyes met.

Something inside Harry eased and he gave a slow nod to Sirius.

He was ready.

"Enter the arena, Harry Potter! Your time starts now!" Bagman announced.

Harry walked slowly to the small gate that stood between him and the pit. He opened it and followed the rocky path down until he was stood in a crevice that looked out at the arena.

The issue of the eggs complicated things, Harry mused. He considered simply making his way out to the flag and summoning the eggs – the advanced charm Flitwick had taught him would work but…he would have to catch the eggs without breaking them and he didn't trust that the dragon wouldn't charge him down if he tried such an approach. No, he was better sticking with his original idea; disable the dragon and then he would worry about the eggs.

He changed position, easing out from behind the wall and the dragon immediately swivelled to stare in Harry's direction; the ruff of golden spikes erect as she sensed danger.

Harry pointed his wand skyward and opened up his full power. "Frigus Ventus!"

For a second, nothing happened but then…

A freezing wind erupted from his wand in a gust that pushed him backwards into the hard rock. He put his free hand out to steady himself and forced his hand to direct his wand where he wanted it; in the direction of the dragon.

The Fireball gave a tremendous roar as the cold hit her. She shook herself as she uncurled, lowered her head and shot out an enormous stream of fire that dispersed the wind.

Harry dodged back.

His heart was pounding.

It wasn't working. He had to be closer. Harry's eyes searched out the rock around him. He tucked his wand into its holster and grabbed hold of a protruding edge, levering himself upwards. He focused on climbing, hand hold followed by foothold, followed by hand hold. Below the dragon paced, occasionally trying to get to him with her flame but Harry was climbing out of reach.

He got to the top of the rock formation and ran lightly along the surface until he was almost near to the edge nearest the dragon. He flattened himself as a blast of fire shot over his head. He peered over into the pit.

The dragon was on her feet in front of him.

All he had to do was jump down and he would be right in front of her. The only problem was that it was quite a jump, the rock was just as hard below him, and it wasn't like the dragon wasn't going to notice him jumping. He'd be toast before he hit the ground.

He needed a distraction.

Harry chewed on his lip as he considered his options. He aimed his wand towards the other side of the pit. "Animatus!" The boulders there rolled together and formed a creature that looked a little like a giant dog. It crept near to the other side of the eggs. Harry immediately pointed his wand back at his throat. "Sonorus!" He cleared his throat. "*Keep the dragon occupied!*" He commanded.

The rock-dog immediately lumbered to do Harry's bidding and the dragon turned around to meet the new threat.

Harry cancelled the sonorus with an absent-minded thought and directed his wand at the ground below, casting a cushioning spell non-verbally. He didn't want to alert the Fireball to what he was doing. He checked on the dragon and the rock-dog. They were dancing around each other but the dragon remained with its back to Harry. Harry quickly wriggled forward, clutched at the edge of the rock and tried to lower himself down slowly until he was hanging by his fingertips to the rock, his face smushed into the shale.

He let go.

The rock he fell onto was soft like grass and Harry had taken greater falls in Quidditch. He rolled as he landed and came up on his feet just in time to see the dragon burn the rock-dog to dust. He cancelled the cushioning charm on the ground; he needed a solid surface.

Harry took a deep breath, centred himself and pointed his wand again. "Frigus Maximus!" He yelled.

The startled dragon whirled around in a shimmer of red and opened her mouth, roaring with anger as she received the full blast of Harry's spell in her face; a stream of white light pouring forth from the holly wand.

The dragon backed away a step, spreading her small wings to protect her eggs from the cold. She opened her mouth and a stream of fire poured out to push the spell away.

Red met white in the centre of the confrontation.

Harry skidded back a few feet but he kept his balance. He gritted his teeth and locked his arm; pushing with all his magical power.

Slowly, slowly, his magic overcame the dragon's fire.

Inch by inch, the white light of the spell gained ground over the fire.

With a sudden rush, his magic extinguished the dragon's fire and swiftly enveloped the Fireball in a white light. The dragon gave a mournful cry and staggered under the cold blanketing her everywhere, as ice formed over her scales, zig-zagging across her skin in a crazy crystalline fashion. She took a haltering side-step and collapsed, unconscious with a thump.

Harry sucked in a needed breath and slowly lowered his aching arm, his eyes never left the dragon. She was down and she wasn't getting up.

He became dimly aware of the crowds' cheers around him but blanked them out to focus on his task, walking on unsteady legs to the nest of dragon eggs. He continued to give the Fireball a wide berth as he climbed up the rock and got a good look at the eggs.

The rock was warm beneath them, Harry realised. He shrugged out of his robe, placing it on the ground and quickly spelling a warming charm on it. He carefully levitated the eggs and bundled them up so they were protected by the folds of the robe from knocking into each other.

He cast a quick look at the dragon. She was beginning to stir. Maybe he could apparate…but no; Harry dismissed the idea swiftly. Sirius had taught him the theory of how to do so in an emergency but Harry wasn't all that well practiced and he would probably break the eggs if he attempted it. He was going to have to do it the hard way.

He hurriedly levitated the robe and its precious contents and began to run over the rocky ground, slipping and sliding with his cargo floating safely behind him. He reached the flag and set the robe down gently, breathing heavily, a stitch in his side from his frantic run. He heated the rock up beneath him and levitated the eggs out of his robe until they were safely arranged.

"Will you look at that?" Bagman's voice boomed out over the arena. "Our youngest competitor has completed the task successfully with all eggs intact! Well done, Harry!"

And suddenly he could hear everything over the beat of his heart and his every breath. The noise was deafening; a cheering wall of applause and whistles.

o-O-o

Sirius gave a relieved sigh and clapped enthusiastically as Harry lifted a hand to wave weakly at the astounded crowd.

It was over.

Thank Merlin.

Remus gripped Sirius's shoulders from behind him. "He was brilliant, Sirius. Really brilliant."

Sirius wasn't going to argue. Harry had been brilliant, although he had almost given Sirius a heart attack when he'd jumped down behind the dragon. He'd been so close to it!

Around him the rest of the House of Black celebrated. Hermione, Ron and Neville were spinning each other around, jumping up and down with excitement. Andromeda had her face still buried in Ted's shoulder. The Malfoys had settled for polite clapping but Sirius caught Lucius sending a smug smirk in the direction of Amos Diggory.

Sirius kept his own gaze on his son. He watched as Harry picked up his robe and started back towards the path up to the contestants' gate.

And Sirius finally started to relax. The Fireball was still down; all Harry had to do was to leave.

"I've never seen such a masterful display of raw power." Ted murmured.

Sirius grinned and turned to reply.

A ferocious roar ripped through the noise of the crowd, silencing everyone and freezing Harry mid-step in the middle of the arena.

Sirius looked hurriedly towards the Fireball but it was only just stirring.

Another roar filled the air. The large gate to the dragons' pens shook under a huge thump and then splintered into bits as it gave under the weight of an enraged dragon.

The Hungarian Horntail stalked into the arena, her green scales glimmering in the weak sunlight, her spikes sharp and glittering.

The Horntail was loose!

And Harry was right in front of it.

Pandemonium spread over the watching crowd as panic took hold; shrieks and shouts echoed around the arena.

"HARRY!" Sirius screamed. He raised his wand to fire at the Horntail.

Remus grabbed him roughly. "You can't help him! The magical barrier won't let anything through!"

Sirius's heart leaped into his throat as Harry began to run for the path and safety, only to have to dive to the side as a long stream of fire erupted from the dragon. Hermione screamed beside Sirius, her hands flying up to cover her face. He only breathed out as Harry threw himself behind a large boulder.

"I have to help him!" Sirius declared, turning for the exit. He could get into the arena through the contestants' gate.

"I'm coming with you!" Remus said hurriedly.

"Me too!" Ron said, determination written all over his pale freckled face.

Andromeda caught hold of Ron and moved to block Hermione and Neville. "You kids are staying here."

Sirius didn't wait to see if she was successful, just trusted that she would take care of keeping the kids out of danger. He ran from the box, Remus at his heels.

Harry needed him.
