# Chapter 5

The figure stood in the doorway backlit by emergency lighting, and for a moment Aris saw himself—or what he might have become if the last seventy-three years had gone differently. Same height, similar build, energy crackling between fingers in patterns he recognized. But where Aris had learned control through decades of practice, this person radiated chaos. Power leaked from them in visible waves, distorting the air, making the vault's lights flicker.

"You," the figure said. Female voice, American accent, young. "I can feel you. Another one who survived."

She stepped forward and the emergency lights steadied enough for Aris to see her properly. Mid-twenties, dark hair pulled back, wearing black tactical gear similar to his own. Her eyes glowed faintly—not metaphorically, but actually emitting light, pupils replaced by swirling energy that shifted through the visible spectrum.

"Who are you?" Aris kept his voice level, hands visible but ready.

"Sarah. Sarah Chen." She moved deeper into the vault, each step leaving scorch marks on the floor. "Subject Zero-Three. Manhattan facility, 1951. They told me I was the only one who lived."

Subject Zero-Three. Two years after him. Aris's mind raced through the implications.

"They lied," he said. "How many facilities were there?"

"Does it matter? They're all gone now. Burned, buried, erased from history." Sarah's gaze swept across the vault's artifacts, hunger visible in her expression. "But not everything was destroyed. SHIELD's been collecting pieces. Fragments. Anything connected to what they did to us."

"And you're here to take them back."

"I'm here to take what's mine." She turned those glowing eyes on him. "The power they gave us came at a cost. You know that. I can feel the hunger in you—the need to absorb more energy, to feed the thing they made us into."

Aris did know. Felt it every time he used his abilities, the pull to draw in more power, to push past his limits. He'd learned to resist it, to maintain control through discipline and sheer stubbornness. But the hunger never truly went away.

"The artifacts won't help you," he said carefully. "They're not stable. Using them will only make things worse."

"Worse than what? Than being a walking time bomb? Than feeling my cells vibrate at frequencies that shouldn't exist?" She laughed, sharp and bitter. "I've spent sixty years trying to be normal. Trying to suppress what they made me. But it doesn't work, does it? The power keeps growing. Eventually you have to feed it or it consumes you from the inside."

In his ear, Natasha's voice crackled urgently. "Kaine, talk to me. What's happening?"

He couldn't respond without revealing the communication. Sarah hadn't made an overtly hostile move yet. Maybe this could still end without violence.

"Listen to me," Aris said. "If you're losing control, SHIELD can help. They have resources, researchers who understand enhanced individuals. Taking these artifacts is only going to make you a target."

"I've been a target my whole life." Sarah moved toward the nearest display case, the one containing the Red Room bioelectric storage device. "Every government agency, every secret organization—they all want what's inside us. Want to study us, replicate us, weaponize us." She pressed her palm against the reinforced glass. "I'm done being someone's science project."

The glass cracked. Then shattered. Energy flowed from the artifact into Sarah's hand in a visible stream, and she gasped, eyes blazing brighter.

"Stop!" Aris moved without thinking, crossing the distance between them. "You don't know what that device was designed to do—"

Sarah spun, faster than he'd expected, and grabbed his wrist.

The world exploded into sensation.

Her touch was like being plugged into a live wire running at a million volts. Energy poured into him—not absorbed, not controlled, but forced in with brutal intensity. Aris felt his own power surge in response, fighting for dominance, two unstable quantum states colliding.

And beneath the energy exchange, he felt her mind.

*Scared. Alone. Hungry. Can't stop can't stop CAN'T STOP—*

He yanked his hand back, breaking contact, stumbling backward. His vision swam, neurons misfiring, every nerve ending screaming.

"You felt it," Sarah said. Her voice had changed, deeper, resonating with inhuman frequencies. The bioelectric device had crumbled to dust in her other hand, its entire energy content absorbed. "The thing they put inside us. The parasite that looks like power."

"It's not a parasite." Aris forced himself upright, fighting the urge to draw energy from the vault's other artifacts just to compensate for what she'd shoved into him. "It's us. Part of us. You can control it if you—"

"I tried control for sixty years!" The lights exploded, glass raining down, artifacts exposed. "It doesn't work. The only thing that helps is more power. More energy. Enough to finally satisfy the hunger."

She reached for another artifact—the AIM matter-conversion device. Aris moved to intercept but she was faster, energy-enhanced reflexes letting her snatch the device and absorb it before he could stop her.

Sarah screamed. Not pain—ecstasy. Power flooded into her until she shone like a star, too bright to look at directly.

"Romanoff," Aris said into the comm. "I need that response team now."

"Already on the way. Thirty seconds."

Not fast enough. Sarah's power was spiking beyond anything Aris had encountered. She was pulling energy from everything—the building's power grid, the artifacts, the thermal radiation in the air, even the electromagnetic fields from people in the offices above.

He felt those fields flicker. Weaken. Start to fade.

She was killing them. Everyone in the building, drained of bioelectric energy to fuel her ascension.

No choice then.

Aris reached out with his abilities and pulled. Not from the artifacts or the building, but from Sarah herself. He latched onto the torrent of power flowing into her and reversed it, redirecting the energy back into the environment, into the ground, anywhere except into her body.

Sarah's eyes widened in shock. "What—no—"

"Sorry," Aris said. "Can't let you kill innocents."

She lashed out, pure energy projection, a blast that would've vaporized a normal person. Aris caught it, absorbed it, spun the kinetic force into a shockwave that knocked Sarah off her feet. She hit the vault wall hard enough to crack concrete.

Then she vanished.

Not teleportation—Aris would've felt that. She'd shifted into a higher energy state, become invisible to normal sight. But he could still sense her electromagnetic signature, moving at enhanced speed, circling.

There. Behind him.

Aris spun, redirecting his momentum into a strike that connected with something solid. Sarah materialized, surprised, and he pressed the advantage. Close-quarters combat, each blow enhanced with precisely controlled energy. He couldn't match her raw power but he had decades more experience.

She fought back wildly, desperately, power without technique. Aris blocked, deflected, countered. He caught her wrist, disrupted her nervous system just enough to slow her down—

Sarah's eyes met his. And he saw it. The desperation. The fear.

"Please," she gasped. "I don't want to die. But I can't stop. It's going to consume me if I don't feed it."

The vault door exploded inward. Six SHIELD agents poured through, weapons raised, tactical lights cutting through the chaos. Behind them, Natasha's voice sharp and commanding: "Stand down! Both of you!"

Sarah's body went rigid. Then she released everything.

Every artifact in the vault activated simultaneously as she pulled power from all of them at once. The chamber filled with light and noise and competing energy signatures that made reality itself scream. Aris felt the quantum structure of space-time beginning to fray.

He had maybe three seconds before everything within a hundred meters ceased to exist.

One second. He reached into the maelstrom, found Sarah's consciousness drowning in power she couldn't control.

Two seconds. He connected to her the way he had with Alexei Kozlov, except this time he wasn't collapsing a quantum state—he was stabilizing one. Forcing order onto chaos through sheer will and the kind of energy manipulation that made his previous stunts look like party tricks.

Three seconds. The world went white.

---

Aris woke to fluorescent lights and the smell of disinfectant. Medical bay. His head felt like someone had used it for percussion practice and his body ached in places he'd forgotten he had.

"Easy." Natasha's voice, close by. "Don't try to move yet."

He opened his eyes. She sat in a chair beside the bed, still in tactical gear, looking exhausted. Dried blood marked a cut above her eyebrow.

"What happened?" His voice came out rough.

"You saved everyone. Again." She offered him a cup of water. "The vault collapsed. You somehow contained the energy release long enough for us to evacuate. By the time the explosion hit, it was just empty space."

Aris drank slowly, memories filtering back. The desperate gamble. Sarah's consciousness tangled with his own. The moment he'd realized the only way to prevent catastrophic release was to absorb it himself.

"Sarah?"

Natasha's expression darkened. "Alive. Unconscious. We have her in containment, power dampeners on maximum. She's not going anywhere."

"Don't let Fury experiment on her."

"That's not his call." She leaned forward, elbows on knees. "I read her file. Sarah Chen, reported dead in 1951 during an accident at a research facility. Except she wasn't dead—she escaped. Spent sixty years in hiding, using fake identities, trying to suppress her abilities. Only came out of hiding when the hunger got too strong to ignore."

"She's like me," Aris said quietly.

"No. She's what you could become if you lose control." Natasha met his eyes. "That's why Fury wants you helping with her rehabilitation. You're the only person who understands what she's going through."

Aris closed his eyes. Another responsibility. Another person whose life he was somehow accountable for. "How long was I out?"

"Sixteen hours. You absorbed enough energy to power Manhattan for a week. The doctors had no idea how you were still alive." A pause. "Neither did I."

"Takes more than that to kill me."

"Clearly." She stood, wincing slightly. "When you're cleared, Fury wants another debriefing. There were five other facilities targeted before Manhattan. We need to know if there are more like you and Sarah out there."

Five facilities. Five potential Subject Zeros. The implications made Aris's chest tight.

"How many did you recover?" he asked.

"Three were empty—artifacts stolen, no casualties. The Swiss facility had four dead agents. And there's one facility in Tokyo that hasn't been hit yet." Natasha pulled out her tablet. "We're reinforcing it now, but if there's another Subject Zero targeting it..."

"Then you'll need me there."

"That's what Fury thinks. But Kaine—" She hesitated, something uncertain crossing her face. "You almost died. Twice in one week. At some point, luck runs out."

"Good thing I'm not relying on luck."

"What are you relying on?"

He thought about that. About the choice to absorb the energy instead of letting it explode. About Sarah's desperate eyes and the hunger he recognized too well.

"Stubbornness," he said finally. "And the hope that I can help people like Sarah before they end up dead or worse."

Natasha studied him for a long moment. Then she nodded, apparently satisfied. "Get some rest. Tokyo op launches in forty-eight hours if you're cleared for duty."

She left. Aris lay in the medical bay, staring at the ceiling, thinking about Project Genesis and the facilities scattered across the globe. About the children who'd been experimented on, transformed, told they were weapons when they were just people trying to survive.

Subject Zero. Subject Zero-Three. How many others?

His hand moved to the USB drive tucked against his chest. Still there, still secure. Volkov's research mentioned multiple facilities, multiple subjects. If he could find the original Project Genesis records, he might be able to locate the others before they ended up like Sarah—desperate and dangerous.

The door opened again. He expected a nurse or doctor, but instead it was a woman in her sixties, gray hair pulled back, wearing a severe black suit. She carried herself with the authority of someone used to being obeyed.

"Mr. Kaine." She pulled up the chair Natasha had vacated. "I'm Dr. Evelyn Cross. I've been assigned to evaluate Sarah Chen's condition and develop a treatment protocol."

"Treatment or containment?"

"Both, hopefully." She set a tablet on the side table. "Director Fury said you'd be helping with her rehabilitation. I'd like to know what I'm working with. Your abilities, your limitations, how you've managed to remain stable when she's clearly not."

Aris looked at her—really looked. Measured her heartbeat through its electromagnetic signature, read the stress hormones in her bloodstream, sensed the micro-expressions that suggested genuine scientific curiosity rather than threat assessment.

She reminded him of researchers from his past. The ones who'd been curious about him as a phenomenon rather than frightened of him as a weapon.

"I'll help," he said. "But I want access to all of SHIELD's files on Project Genesis. Everything you have, no redactions."

Dr. Cross's eyebrows rose. "That's classified at the highest levels."

"And I'm the only person who can help Sarah Chen stay alive. Your call, Doctor."

She considered, fingers drumming on the tablet. Then: "I'll speak to Director Fury. No promises, but I'll make the case." She stood. "In the meantime, you should know—Sarah's deteriorating. The power dampeners are barely holding. If we can't stabilize her in the next week, she'll either die or become too dangerous to contain."

"Then we'd better work fast."

After Dr. Cross left, Aris dozed fitfully, dreams filled with burning facilities and children screaming as their bodies were transformed into weapons. He woke to Natasha's voice in the hallway, speaking quietly with someone.

"—don't care what his file says, Hill. He saved forty people today. That counts for something."

"I'm not disputing his effectiveness." A woman's voice, cool and professional. "But he's an unknown, Romanoff. No records before 2003, abilities that seem to expand every time we test him, and now we know he's connected to classified programs from 1949. That's a security risk."

"Or an asset we desperately need."

"Can be both."

Footsteps. They were moving away. Aris lay still, processing what he'd heard. Maria Hill, from the sound of it—Fury's second-in-command, pragmatic to a fault. She wasn't wrong to be suspicious. He was a security risk. Just hopefully a useful one.

His phone buzzed. Someone had left it on the bedside table, fully charged. Text from an unknown number:

*You're looking for answers about Project Genesis. I have them. Meet me at the location attached. Come alone. Tell no one.*

An address in Queens followed. Abandoned warehouse district.

Aris stared at the message. Every instinct screamed trap. But whoever sent this knew about Genesis, knew about him, knew how to contact him through a phone that should've been secure.

He typed back: *Who is this?*

The response came immediately: *Someone who was there. 1949. I watched them make you.*

His hands trembled slightly. Seventy-three years of questions. Seventy-three years of searching for answers about what he was and who'd created him.

And now someone was offering those answers.

Aris deleted the messages, stood on shaky legs, and started getting dressed. His tactical gear was folded neatly on a chair—someone had cleaned and repaired it. He armed himself quietly, efficiently, moving through the motions he'd performed thousands of times.

This was stupid. Reckless. Exactly the kind of thing that got operatives killed in bad spy novels.

He was going anyway.

The hospital ward was quiet at 3 AM. Aris slipped past the nurse's station using a carefully controlled electromagnetic pulse to disrupt the security cameras—not damage them, just create a convenient blind spot. He took the stairs down twelve floors, avoided the lobby entirely in favor of a service entrance, and was on the street before anyone noticed his absence.

Queens at this hour felt empty, dreamlike. Streetlights cast pools of orange glow across wet pavement. The address led him to a warehouse that had seen better decades, graffiti-covered walls and broken windows speaking to long abandonment.

Aris approached cautiously, every sense extended. The warehouse radiated no obvious danger—no energy weapons, no hostile intentions, just... emptiness.

He entered through a side door that hung open.

Inside, the space was vast and dark except for a single light in the center. And beneath that light, sitting on an old crate, was a man who looked seventy but moved like forty.

"Hello, Subject Zero," the man said. "Or do you prefer Aris these days?"

Aris stopped ten feet away, hand near his weapon. "Who are you?"

"Dr. Marcus Webb. I was lead researcher on Project Genesis." The man smiled sadly. "I'm the one who turned you into what you are."

The world seemed to tilt. Aris steadied himself against a support beam, mind racing. This was the man. The one responsible for everything—his abilities, his longevity, the hunger that Sarah couldn't control.

"Why?" The word came out hoarse. "Why reach out now?"

"Because there are seven more like you. And someone's hunting them."
