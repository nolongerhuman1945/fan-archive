# The Ancient Station

The docking bay was larger than their entire ship, and unlike anything Nova had ever seen. The walls seemed to be made of light itself, shifting and flowing in patterns that hurt to look at directly.

They'd been met by three beings that defied description. Humanoid in shape, yes, but their skin seemed to be made of starlight, and their eyes held entire galaxies. When they spoke, it was as much with their bodies as with their voices—gestures that conveyed meaning beyond words.

Their leader introduced themself as Zara, though the name was only an approximation. "We are the Keepers," they explained as they led the crew through corridors that shouldn't exist, spaces that bent reality itself.

"We have been waiting for your species to reach this point in your evolution. The signal you detected was a beacon, set to activate when a civilization achieved faster-than-light travel."

"But how?" Dr. Kess asked, her scientific curiosity overriding caution. "How did you know our language? How did you know we'd come?"

Zara's smile was like watching a supernova. "Time works differently for us. We exist across multiple temporal dimensions. For us, your arrival has already happened, is happening, and will happen. We simply prepared accordingly."

Nova's mind reeled. Temporal dimensions? Time that wasn't linear? It was impossible. And yet, here they were.

"You said you've been waiting," Nova pressed. "Why? What do you want from us?"

Zara stopped before a massive door—or what might have been a door. In this place, it was hard to tell. "Not from you," they said. "For you. There is knowledge here. Technologies. Understandings of the universe that your species is not yet ready for, but will be. Soon."

The door opened, revealing a chamber that stretched into infinity. Shelves lined the walls, each holding objects that glowed with inner light. Books made of energy. Crystals that sang. Maps of universes that didn't exist.

"This," Zara said, "is the Archive. The collected knowledge of a thousand civilizations across a million years. And it's yours, if you're ready."

Nova looked at her crew, at the wonder and fear in their faces. They'd come looking for first contact. They'd found something far greater.

The question was: were they ready for what came next?
