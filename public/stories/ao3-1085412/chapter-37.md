***ATTACKS AT THE WORLD CUP!*** *Rita Skeeter*

*To the shock of all, the wondrous Quidditch World Cup last night ended in terror with a series of attacks from malcontents.*

*A serious fire broke out at the stadium itself resulting in the evacuation of the Minister's party which included prominent members of the Wizengamot, the Irish and Bulgarian Ministers. Although initially thought of an accident, the erection of anti-transport wards suggested a bleaker purpose. Aurors on site with the help of volunteers led by Lord Sirius Black managed to keep the fire contained to the East and North stands before relinquishing their place to the Magical Catastrophe team who brought a Magical Fire Unit. Questions were raised by Lord Black at the scene why a Unit hadn't been acquired for the stadium to meet standard fire regulations. The Minister of Magic has promised an immediate investigation.*

*Unfortunately, the fire was but a diversion for four different attacks. The first was directed at Lord Harry Potter, the Boy Who Lived, and it was only the bravery of family friends William Weasley and Minerva McGonagall that prevented the kidnapping of young Harry, who heroically shielded everyone else in the tent including many women and children while the brave two engaged the attacker.*

*Close friend Karen Abbott stated: "Harry, Minerva and Bill protected everyone in the Potter Alliance tent. We owe them a great debt of gratitude." Professor McGonagall, a Hogwarts teacher for many years, sustained minor injuries and was released last night by St Mungo's into the care of Lord Black. Mister Weasley remains in critical condition at the hospital having sustained a dark curse that turned his liver to jelly.*

*The Weasley family was itself a target of the second attack which found their tent subjected to a lockdown ward and set on fire. Alerted to the danger by the taunts of the Potter Alliance attacker, Harry once again played rescuer along with the Weasleys' youngest son Ronald and school friends, Hermione Granger and Neville Longbottom. In an impressive show of magic, Harry overpowered the ward and the children rescued Arthur Weasley, the current Chair of the Muggle Affairs Committee, his daughter Ginevra and his son Charles. All three remained in St Mungo's overnight for observation.*

*Additionally, a muggleborn family was attacked by two men wearing black robes and white masks reminiscent of You-Know-Who's followers, and separately there was an incident of muggle-baiting by similarly dressed men. These attackers were apprehended by the DMLE and the families involved sustained minor injuries.*

*It is suspected that these attacks are a protest against the move to acknowledge the recent technological and scientific advances of muggles in order to better protect our world. Minister Fudge stated forcefully; "These men will be prosecuted to the full extent of the law. We will not bow to terrorists and trying to invoke the past fear and anguish of You-Know-Who's reign by wearing similar costumes and executing similar tactics is particularly despicable."*

*We at the Daily Prophet fully support the Minister's position and our best wishes go to the Weasley family for a speedy recovery.*

Simeon finished reading the article over Sirius's shoulder and sighed as he took a seat on the opposite side of the desk. "At least the press came out positive for our side."

Sirius grimaced. "That was pretty much Cornelius's reaction."

"From his point of view, everything worked out." Remus said from his position by the window. "The Death Eaters were caught; nobody died; all else is manageable in his view. He'll end up giving Bagman a slap on the wrist because of the missing Fire Unit and call it a job well done."

"And they call me the pessimistic one." Sirius muttered. But Remus was right. His conversation with Cornelius via the floo had already covered every single one of Remus's points although he had agreed a proper investigation for the Fire Unit was called for since its lack was used to enable arson.

"So the main issue is the life debts, right?" Simeon said. "Working out the mess of who saved who?"

"Unfortunately." Sirius confirmed glumly. "I think everyone considers the fire a group effort since it threatened everyone and everyone took care of it…"

"So quid pro quo." Simeon nodded. "Obviously nobody is going to claim the muggle family owe a life debt?"

"If they owe a life debt to anyone, it's possibly Harry who distracted the Death Eaters when the boys stumbled over them according to what he said last night." Sirius said thoughtfully. "But there's no precedent for enforcing a life debt when a muggle owes it because of the Statute of Secrecy so…"

"No life debt." Simeon concluded.

"Nor for the muggleborn family as they were ultimately rescued by Aurors, who are, by virtue of their profession, excluded from life debts." Remus shifted position, turning to face the room rather than the gardens.

"Which leaves the attack on the Potter alliance and the Weasleys." Simeon said.

"According to Harry's statement last night to Amelia, we can deduce that the efforts of three people saved those in the Potter alliance tent; Bill and Minerva who fought with the attacker, and Harry himself in raising the shield." Remus stated quietly. "The presence of Harry within the tent arguably was the reason for the danger thus negating any life debt owed to him, and it's also arguable that he was acting in concert with the oaths taken between the alliance so again; no life debt owed."

"Some will feel that no life debt is owed to Bill and Minerva because they were defeated in the duel and the attacker ultimately left because he couldn't get to Harry or anyone else behind the shield. Well, he tried to hurt Neville but the House of Longbottom saved itself in that instance." Sirius added.

"I would suggest proposing to the rest of the alliance that any debt to Bill and Minerva is owed by the House of Potter and allow us to handle the matter." Remus advised.

"Is any debt owed by the House of Potter for Weasley?" Simeon interjected. "Forgive me if I'm wrong but he was there because he's sworn to service and that includes an element of acknowledged risk. He took on the duty of guarding Harry of his own accord."

"I agree with Simeon," Remus held up a hand when Sirius went to argue, "I would feel that there was no debt if it had been me instead of Bill. Plus there's the fact that Harry in turn saved Arthur, Ginny and Charlie last night. In the balance of things it may be better to suggest to the House of Weasley that in the spirit of the alliance of friendship, both Houses agree no debts are owed on either side, although Arthur probably needs a separate discussion with the Longbottoms – Neville did risk his life saving Arthur and Charlie."

"Fair enough." Sirius said. "Which leaves Minnie."

"Who is the Regent Apparent to the House of Potter and therefore by law is directed to protect Lord Potter as a minor." Simeon pointed out. "No life debt."

"Well, we may still want to do something personally to acknowledge her." Remus said to Sirius.

"I was thinking of offering her a permanent home in Griffin House," Sirius mused out loud. He'd been thinking about it for a while since Minnie had spent a lot of time with them during the Summer. She'd actually been released into their care the night before by St Mungo's and was currently at Griffin House being fussed over by Dobby and Harry. "What do you think?"

Remus nodded. "It's OK with me. But you'll need to talk to Harry."

Sirius nodded. He'd intended to without Remus's word of caution. Griffin House was Harry's home first and foremost. "Well, that deals with the life debts. I'll send out a letter to all the Heads of Houses who had family in the Potter alliance tent to confirm they agree."

"How is Harry this morning?" asked Simeon, reaching for his discarded coffee cup.

"Grounded until he's thirty." Sirius replied dryly. He didn't think the fear of losing Harry that had flooded him on receiving news of the attack would ever leave him. The terror he'd felt when he'd arrived at the Potter alliance tent only for Harry not to be there; in arriving at the Weasleys' tent only to be told by Hermione that Harry had just suddenly charged into the woods…

He'd listened when Harry had given his statement to Amelia and had been alternatively proud and furious; proud at Harry's heroism, his skills and his steadfastness in his friendships; furious that so much of what Harry had done had put him at risk especially his last act…

The fact that Harry had acted in anger going after the attacker was something that Sirius understood – he'd done the same thing with Wormtail after all – but it scared Sirius. The outcome could have been so much worse than that of a bad cut and some colourful bruises. Harry had sheepishly admitted that he'd been outclassed in his duel and if Neville hadn't turned up and created a diversion…

"Seriously?" asked Simeon with amusement. "He saves everyone and you ground him?"

Sirius leaned back in his desk chair and ignored the snort from the peanut gallery also known as Moony. "Just you wait until Jason gets older."

"Actually, Harry pinpointed his own mistakes; going with Ron without asking any adult to accompany them and going after the attacker alone in the woods. He even suggested his own punishment," Remus added, amusement colouring his tone again, "since Padfoot and he have this punishment system they worked out a while ago so we're consistent across the board when he does something wrong."

Sirius harrumphed but he couldn't deny Remus's charge.

They'd waited until breakfast before a discussion and a rehash of events because they'd all been exhausted the night before. Apart from the attacks themselves, everyone had been interviewed by Aurors and then they'd all gone to St Mungo's for treatment. Bed and a good night's sleep had been the priority for everyone once they'd gotten home.

But coming down to breakfast, Sirius had been all ready to yell at Harry, point out just how much danger he had placed himself in by running in without thinking, and hand out Harry's punishment of being grounded for the rest of his life. Before he could utter a word, the blighter had apologised, acknowledged his mistakes and accepted his punishment according to the system they'd worked out. Sirius had settled for hugging the daylights out of Harry again.

Simeon nodded slowly. "I guess there have to be rules. Or so Anna keeps telling me." He grinned, drained his coffee and stood up. "Speaking of the ball and chain, Anna wants to hit Harrods today for last minute souvenirs and shopping. You need me for anything?"

Sirius shook his head. "Don't forget tonight's the Farewell Dinner; family only."

"See you then, mon frère." Simeon left the study and Sirius dropped his gaze to the Prophet again.

Remus moved from the window and dropped into a chair. He steepled his fingers together. "Harry wasn't the only one to make mistakes yesterday."

"Are you suggesting I should ground myself, Moony?" Sirius asked disgruntled at the criticism but feeling that he deserved it.

"Actually I was referring to me."

Sirius's head shot up at the chagrined shame of Remus's quiet statement. "You didn't do anything wrong. Merlin, I was the one who pushed you into taking on translation duty for Cornelius instead of protecting Harry as we agreed."

"If I had objected you would have apologised and found someone else. You were only asked in the first place because I showed off my language skills instead of keeping Mum, and drew Cornelius's attention." Remus protested. "And once the fire broke out, I should never have asked you for help and I should have made my way straight to you and Harry rather than letting Amelia side-track me with finding the anti-transportation ward." He sighed. "And let's not forget my letting the rat get away again!"

"Firstly, I will state again that it was me who made the decision on the translation duty and, honestly, if I had sent Harry home with Simeon and Anna after meeting the Quidditch teams, none of the rest of it would have mattered!" Sirius countered, rubbing his head at the slight throb of a headache.

"You wanted him to enjoy the moment!" Remus argued. "And we thought everything would happen later!"

"We knew there was a death threat, I was stupid not to have evacuated him immediately when you sent the message." Sirius said simply. "And I should never have left Harry even if I do have the training to deal with a fire," he continued, "if I had been there…"

"It may have deterred the attacker, it may not," Remus pointed out, "we don't know for certain. You might have ended up the same way as Bill. The attacker probably would have still gone after the Weasleys and if he did and we didn't have a warning of it…" he sighed heavily, "Molly could quite have easily been mourning a husband, a son and her only daughter this morning."

Sirius acknowledged the truth of that by inclining his head a touch. It was a sobering thought.

"The truth is that no single decision either you or I took in isolation was *wrong*, necessarily at the time. We just need to learn from yesterday and…" Remus waved a hand at him, "not make the same mistakes again."

"Yesterday shows we should dump plan B and go with plan A." Sirius muttered.

"No, Sirius, we're not wrapping Harry in cotton wool and hiding him from the world for the rest of his natural life." Remus objected before he grimaced. "No matter how much I might want to go with that plan. Besides, plan B isn't working out too badly."

Sirius harrumphed and got up. He wandered over to the far side of the study and with a stab of his wand, revealed the hidden blackboard that detailed out their original plan.

"Politically, we're solid." Remus said walking up to stand next to him. "The Potter alliance is back; the Order of Merlin recipients are already agreed to join at the September session. You'll have the neutral bloc alliances to announce along with the détente with Wilkes and Selwyn to go along with the one you have with Nott."

Sirius folded his arms. "Solid is a good word. We can start to make some real changes to the laws by Christmas."

Remus nodded. "Just as we planned. So, we're shutting down Voldemort's access to political power and decreasing the number of allies he has and the financial base he can draw upon." He sighed and pointed his wand at the board. *'Foreign policy'* appeared as a task. "We need to think about this more."

"Agreed. The Treasure Hunt isn't going so well." Sirius commented.

"It's stalled," agreed Remus, "but I think getting rid of three of the six horcruxes isn't a bad showing. We only have two to go since the diary is already handled."

"We should probably get rid of the snake too, Albus is right about that." Sirius added a note to the board. "Well, Godric's Hollow is on hold until Bill's out of the hospital and we'll have to wait for him and Caro to have a legitimate reason to be in Hogwarts to search for the diadem."

"Tag the Death Eater worked well for the World Cup." Remus said. "The problem was the rogue who upset the applecart and who apparently is working with Voldemort since Peter was helping him last night."

Sirius took in the pain on Remus's face and placed a hand on his friend's shoulder. "It's not your fault he got away."

"It is my fault." Remus argued. "I should have done something more! Tomas thinks he managed to catch him with a cutting hex when Peter transformed to apparate but as it was meant to disable rather than kill, Peter probably survived it. I couldn't even nail Peter with a stunner!"

"Because he transformed into his animagus form." Sirius said. "He's bloody difficult to catch or hit because of his form. I should know!"

Remus pointed his wand at the board and *'find a way to neutralise the rat'* appeared. "We need to take away his advantage. There are some old wards that will force an animagus into human form. I'll research them."

Sirius patted his shoulder

"We also need to know who this Hollins guy really is since the real Auror Hollins was busy dealing with the fire." Sirius murmured unhappily.

"Agreed; we need to focus some effort on finding out who the rogue is and shutting him down." Remus said, adding the item to the blackboard.

"I'll settle for killing him." Sirius said evenly.

That Remus didn't argue showed the werewolf's own anger at the man who'd managed to get close enough to Harry to almost kill him.

"We have an unknown rogue and we have Voldemort and the rat staying somewhere unknown. We know they're working together." Remus mused out loud. "None of the known Death Eaters are hiding the bastards."

Sirius frowned. "You think they're staying together?"

"It's probable," Remus said, "since Wormtail admitted that the rogue was acting on Voldemort's order. I think this guy must be whoever is giving Voldemort house-space. Voldemort knows about him. The other Death Eaters don't, yes, which is why Lucius doesn't know about him…but his Master? No. I hate to agree with Lucius but I think he's right; this is someone like Peter; someone Voldemort kept secret in the war."

"Great." Sirius snarled. He swept a hand through his hair.

"Thinking about it, this was all probably an attempt to grab Harry for this ritual we think Voldemort is planning," Remus continued, "if they had Harry, they could keep him terrorised and challenged for the nine months without using the tournament."

"You think the tournament is their plan B?" Sirius asked as his blood ran cold as he thought about Harry being kept somewhere, being tortured and hurt.

"Yes. The more I think about it, the more I do." Remus sighed. "I think I'm pleased Harry has grounded himself until he goes to Hogwarts."

Sirius couldn't speak. He nodded.

It was Remus's turn to place a comforting hand on his shoulder. "It'll be OK, Padfoot. The other thing that is going well is Harry's training. He needs some more duelling practice but he's good. He survived long enough against someone who downed Bill for help to arrive; that's no mean feat."

"Right," said Sirius, trying to take comfort in Remus's words, "and he knows his animagus form now. He just needs to perfect it. If he could transform…"

"Even if he was abducted, he'd have a way out nobody would suspect." Remus agreed. He sighed and pointed at the board where they'd written *'the power he knows not.'* "We have two candidates for this power: the Hallows and the family magic."

"He called the Longbottom magic." Sirius said. "Augusta told me that she'd asked Amelia to change Neville's statement to say family magic rather than detailing that it was theirs and not ours that got called. Harry only said in his statement that he had called family magic."

"Do you think Ollivander's story is right? That Harry as the most powerful wizard of his generation can call on *all* of the family magic?" Remus asked.

"Maybe, or it could be the oath of fealty allowed Harry to call Neville's family magic when Neville was in danger – Neville pledged his magic to Harry." Sirius sighed and shrugged. "We still know so little about how it works and Harry's relationship to it."

"Which leaves us with the Hallows." Remus sighed. "The source Ollivander quoted wasn't in your grandfather's papers. I haven't been able to track it down. I think I should ask Ollivander."

"We're not there yet." Sirius cautioned him. "We still have to confront Albus about the wand."

"Are you telling Harry as planned?" asked Remus frowning.

"Yes," Sirius nodded, "and we'll discuss what he wants to do." He sighed. "I want to protect him but he needs to know that Albus will continue to keep things from him."

"And justify it all with 'it's for his own good.'" Remus added with a touch of bitterness.

"Or the Greater Good," pointed out Sirius wryly, "whichever he feels will most suit the situation at hand." He shook himself briskly like Padfoot and did a tempus charm. "I'm going to head to St Mungo's. I promised Harry I'd look in on Bill and the rest of the Weasley clan personally since he can't leave the house."

Remus nodded crisply. "Leave the board out. I want to have a think and maybe add a couple of things."

Sirius patted his back. "Thanks, Moony."

It didn't take long to get to the floo and travel to the premier wizarding hospital. He had left orders that the Weasleys be treated with the honour bestowing an Ancient and Noble House so he wasn't surprised to find they'd been designated a private suite on the Spell Damage Ward. He bought a couple of things from the gift shop and headed up in one of the lifts with a surprisingly cheerful ghost who had died two weeks before from choking on a chicken bone in the waiting room.

He slowed in the corridor as he spotted Percy Weasley outside the suite door in the corridor, facing the wall and crying into the sleeve of his robe.

"Percy?" prompted Sirius gently. "Is…are you alright?" He huffed. "Stupid question, I know, I mean obviously you're not alright. How could you be alright with half your family in the hospital?"

"That's not…" Percy swiped at his eyes with the back of his hand, and Sirius juggled the balloons and gifts to hand him a handkerchief. "Sorry, Lord Black."

"Call me Sirius." Sirius corrected softly. "Now, what's the problem?"

Percy hesitated but he heaved a sigh and gave in to the need to confide in someone. "I had to go into work this morning. The department has a huge amount of clean-up to do and Mister Crouch is still recovering from the flu – he had to leave straight after the match yesterday and sent an owl this morning rather than coming in himself!" He said defensively. "I took an early lunch break so I could come and see everyone but they're all mad at me anyway."

"Because you went to work rather than staying with your family?" Sirius clarified.

And he could understand why the rest of the Weasley children might not appreciate Percy's work ethic. With the exception of Percy himself, Molly, Fred and George, the rest of the Weasleys had been attacked and hospitalised. Most people would have taken the day to be with them. On the other hand, the sense of responsibility that had dictated Percy's action in going to work wasn't a bad thing. Crouch should have offered him a personal day, Sirius thought irritated, but then that was Crouch all over; unthinking and uncompromising.

Percy nodded. "I do care that they almost died…" he looked embarrassed at the admission. "But I'm needed at work."

"Percy," Sirius began cautiously, "I know you admire Mister Crouch greatly," and Sirius tried hard not to feel aggrieved by that – Barty had sent him to prison without a trial, "and Barty has always had a strong work ethic," he could see the mutinous expression forming on Percy's face, "but Barty spent so much time at work and in pursuit of his ambitions that he didn't realise his son was a Death Eater. There is a balance, and I'm not saying you haven't gotten it right today but just…nobody would blame you for taking a personal day."

Percy straightened his shoulders. "I don't want to let Mister Crouch down and I have responsibilities. I don't know why others don't see that."

Sirius knew it was futile to keep arguing. "Well, I should make my way inside. Will you join me?"

"I should get back to the office." Percy said, looking towards the door with a mixture of want and hurt. "Tell them I'll be by later."

"Of course." Sirius watched him walk away and sighed. He was hardly going to get through to the young man, he reminded himself. He and Percy's new hero, Crouch, had too much enmity for that. He knocked sharply on the door and entered at the chorus of 'come in' from the Weasleys behind the door.

The room was very restful, decked out in calm sea-greens and deep night-time blues. Large windows let in lots of sunlight. There were four beds; two either side of the room. Arthur and Ginny were on the left, Bill and Charlie on the right. Bill was closest to the door designating his position as the one most requiring attention; the twins sat one either side of the bed keeping watch on their sleeping brother. Ron sat on Charlie's bed playing chess.

Most of the faces lit up with one notable exception; Molly who was camped out with knitting needles between Arthur and Ginny. Remus had been the one to collect her from the Burrow and escort her to St Mungo's the night before and Sirius wasn't looking forward to her reaction to seeing him especially without…

"Where's Harry?" Molly immediately asked.

"Hello to you too, Molly." Sirius greeted her wryly. Before she could say anything more, he handed her the 'Get Well' balloons. He made his way to Arthur and handed him the large box of chocolates and tin of biscuits he'd bought. "For you and your family, Arthur."

"Thank you, Sirius." Arthur said, watching in amusement as his wife's face turned red. "I take it you kept Harry home given the attempt on his life yesterday?"

"He's also grounded for taking unnecessary risks. Obviously while we're happy he saved you, some of his actions lacked forethought." Sirius began to explain.

"Like going after the bloke who did it?" Arthur nodded.

Ron scowled. "I would have gone after him too if Hermione hadn't sat on me."

"And you would have been grounded too if you had." Arthur said firmly. "I might be very proud of your helping to rescue us, Ron, but I'm still debating what on earth was going through your head asking Harry to help you instead of an adult since he has a death threat hanging over him."

Ron flushed red.

"Harry sends his love," Sirius said, changing the topic slightly, "we tried to see you last night but by the time we'd finished with the Aurors, the Ward was closed to all but family and the night mediwitch refused to let us in."

She had been singularly unimpressed with Sirius's Lordship or Harry's status as the Boy Who Lived.

"Then, we were asked to take Minerva home so…"

Molly sat down again with a harrumph. "How is Minerva?"

"Mostly annoyed," Sirius waved a hand towards Bill, "and feeling guilty she didn't do more. Physically she's healed although she was moving a bit carefully at breakfast. Dobby made her take a pain relief potion."

"Bill will be relieved to hear she's better when he's awake." Arthur said. "They've got him in a healing sleep to get around the pain issue as his liver heals. He won't wake until late this afternoon."

Sirius nodded in understanding. He pointed at a plush soft toy of a snake on his bedside cabinet. "Present?"

"From the woman he works with," Molly sniffed, "Caroline Something?" Her face brightened. "Alicia was here earlier too. She's working a shift right now but will be back later. They make a lovely couple."

Evidently Molly was already planning a wedding, Sirius thought half-amused.

"The Healers were very complementary about Alicia's immediate care in Bill's case; they think it saved his life." Arthur shuffled further up against his pillows and Molly immediately moved to help him, pushing past Sirius who moved out of her way. "Speaking of which, I'm glad you're here, Sirius, because I could do with your advice about the life debt issues incurred last night."

Molly cleared her throat loudly. "Boys, you can go and get some fresh air for a while." She shooed the twins and Ron from the room with an efficiency that enthralled and appalled Sirius in equal measure. She moved onto Ginny very quickly. "Come along, Ginny, we should get you cleaned up and into fresh clothes. The Healers said you would be released this afternoon; no need for you to be lollygagging in your nightwear."

They were both out of the room were surprising speed despite Ginny's pleading eyes to her father.

Sirius sighed. "Remus, Simeon and I were just discussing the life debt business before I came here. It's a bit of a mess really."

"What was your conclusion?" asked Arthur.

Sirius explained the discussion succinctly. "I'd like to think we agree that the actions Bill took to save Harry and Harry took to save your family cancel each other out in the spirit of the alliance of friendship between the House of Potter and the House of Weasley."

Arthur grimaced. "I think you're letting us off lightly there, Sirius, but I'll take the proposal with thanks." He sighed. "I'll also accept that no-one in the Potter alliance tent owes a debt to Bill, I think he'll agree with that since his actions ultimately failed to protect them."

Sirius winced. "I wouldn't put it that way, Arthur."

"You didn't," Arthur reminded him, "and no matter how proud I am of Bill's actions last night, the truth is that he lost the duel."

"He's going to kick himself silly over that." Charlie offered. The second eldest son of the Weasley brood had been listening quietly since Arthur and Sirius had begun their discussion.

"Whoever it was that attacked us is a very powerful and accomplished wizard." Sirius noted. They should really consider that part of the profile as they tried to reduce suspects. Not everybody had a talent to make the potion needed to impersonate someone; not everyone had a talent for duelling and warding.

"So the remaining issue is Neville Longbottom." Arthur broke into Sirius's thoughts. "The boy risked his life in saving me and Charlie."

"I can do what Bill did, Dad," Charlie offered, "swear service to the House of Longbottom for a time."

"Actually, I think Augusta would prefer the use of your old stables behind the orchard at the Burrow. She's been having trouble with finding a new stable for the Longbottom horses since she's on the verge of selling their Spanish place. I know Remus has been pricing building one for her at Longbottom Manor." Sirius said dryly. "Your stables would be fine with a couple of days work to fix them up. You could negotiate a reasonable deal there."

"Ginny would be happy," Arthur commented, "she always wanted a pony." He sighed and glanced over at Charlie. "Thank you for the offer though, son."

"It's my life he saved, Dad." Charlie pointed out. "My Bubble Head must have collapsed when I got thrown backwards. I'm never going to live that down when I get back to the Reserve."

"Well, at least you cast yours correctly." Arthur said with chagrin. "Mine was hopeless and the one I cast on Ginny hardly lasted any longer."

"I can't do them properly either." Sirius commiserated. "Mine are complete bollocks. Moony always had to cast them for me. Harry said Hermione did his and Neville's."

Arthur smiled gratefully. "Did you read today's paper? The theory that this…*person* wants to defeat the move to establish a closer relationship with muggles?"

"I'm not sure Rita's got it right." Sirius said. "But he's working for Voldemort and it's something Voldemort would want stopped."

"All the more reason to go forward then. You-Know- *Voldemort* will find that the Weasleys aren't so easily cowed." Arthur said firmly. "We haven't been a Gryffindor family for years for no reason."

Sirius smiled at him. "You're a good man, Arthur, although I suspect that you'll have a meeting with Amelia to discuss security measures in your near future to look forward to."

Arthur nodded. "I find that I'm surprisingly alright with whatever measures Amelia thinks I should take." He smiled grimly. "I might be a Gryffindor but I do have a family to protect." He sighed. "I should apologise for Ron dragging Harry with him to check on us but if he hadn't…"

Sirius struggled with what to say and ended up sighing. "They're friends. If it had been James and I…we would have done exactly the same. Harry knows he should have grabbed an adult to go with them or sent an adult in the first place but…you're right. If they hadn't checked on you…those lockdown wards are bloody hard to bring down. Harry's probably one of the few wizards on the planet who could overpower a ward like that." He shifted his weight. "Remus says we all need to learn from our mistakes and move on. I think he's right."

Arthur nodded.

Sirius cast another look at Bill. "I'll come back tonight to visit Bill when he's awake."

"Thank you for visiting, Sirius, and give our love to Harry." Arthur smiled.

Sirius nodded briskly and left the room with a wave to Charlie.

He flooed back to Black Manor, spent an hour doing correspondence on the life debt issue and finally, flooed back to Griffin House.

Dobby popped in immediately. "Harry Potter is in the sun room with Harry Potter's Professor McGoggles and Mooey."

Sirius thanked Dobby fondly and wandered down to the sun room. He could hear Minnie's voice before he entered the room and realised she was leading Harry through a meditation. His footsteps automatically sped up.

Harry was once again a raven. He perched on the seat of a chair opposite Minnie who looked gleeful even as her voice carried on in soothing tones, encouraging Harry to get used to the feel of his wings, his clawed feet, his sharp beak, and his keen eyes.

Remus grinned at him from a corner of the room and Hedwig watched silently, perched on the back of a dining chair. Sirius was relieved that Remus and Hedwig were present. Minnie was at heart a tabby cat and if she let her animagus form gain control for just a moment…well, he trusted Remus and Hedwig would protect his little raven. Or, thought Sirius with some amusement seeing the intent look on Hedwig's face, *her* raven. Maybe he should call Harry 'Owlet?'

"Begin to think of your human form, Harry," Minnie said firmly, "consider your toes; wriggle them, imagine them sinking back into the rug. Consider your legs and how they support you as you sit on your bottom. Consider your body. Consider your arms and your fingers. The shape and feel of your fingertips. Consider your face; your features. Keep thinking, Harry. Remember how you feel as a human. You have skin not feathers. You have a nose not a beak. You have feet not claws. You have arms not wings. Let the raven fly away and resume your human form."

Harry blurred and transformed.

But not completely.

He was covered with black feathers.

Sirius couldn't help it. He burst into laughter and Remus followed. Harry shot him an annoyed look but then his eyes dropped to his hand, covered with tiny black feathers and the disgust on Harry's face set Remus off again.

"Really, Mister Lupin, Mister Black," Minnie sniffed haughtily, "I fail to see what is so amusing."

Sirius got a hold of himself. "Sorry, Harry."

"Now, Harry, close your eyes and think of skin, the tiny lines that run across it, the colour of it, the small hairs that coat the surface. Keep your skin in your mind. Think of it. Remember how the wind feels against it or the sun. Focus." Minnie continued, ignoring Sirius and Remus in favour of returning to the lesson.

Harry blurred again and when he solidified he was without feathers.

"Excellent, Harry!" Minnie clapped her hands. "Excellent!"

Hedwig barked her approval.

"That was brilliant." Sirius added, moving into the room properly to hug his son.

"Maybe we should call you Feathers?" Remus offered, coming forward to sit beside Harry.

Harry pulled a face at him and gestured at Sirius impatiently. "Did you see Bill?"

"I did," Sirius said, "he was sleeping but he's going to be fine. I'll go back later to talk with him. Arthur and the other Weasleys send their love. They're all OK, just being kept in for observation."

Harry breathed out and relief skittered over his features before settling there as though he'd accepted that he could be vulnerable enough to show it in front of them.

"That's a relief to know." Minnie said. "I believe I should join you in duelling practice. It has been many years since I have had to defend myself in such a way and I was less than useful."

"You were brilliant!" defended Harry gallantly. "The thing you did setting the chairs on him was really cool."

Minnie flushed with pleasure at the praise but she shook her head. "I need practice I'm afraid." She looked directly at Sirius. "I would like to join your DADA lessons."

"You're more than welcome." Sirius said. "However, Harry will be back in Hogwarts this time next week."

He had to hide the smile that he wanted to make at the stunned expression on her face as she realised she'd forgotten.

"However, we can always stop by the school and provide some extra tutoring." Remus offered, sounding as amused as Sirius felt. "Just a thought."

"A good one." Harry said eagerly. "Maybe we could do a session mid-week? I'd have practice for the duelling elective that way."

"We'll be in the Hogsmeade property so close by." Remus reminded him brightly.

The Hogsmeade property was a three bedroomed cottage on the outskirts that had needed complete renovation; the tiny kitchen, dining room and front parlour were being remodelled into a kitchen with an attached small orangery at the back and an open plan living and dining area. Remus would take the attic room which would have an en-suite shower, leaving the two bedrooms on the first floor for Harry and Sirius. Harry had the small room; Sirius had the double; they'd share a bathroom. It was cosy and charming, and would do as a bolthole for Harry if he wanted to spend Hogsmeade weekends with them. Sirius was happy to live there while Harry was in school. The Three Broomsticks was a brisk ten minute walk from the front gate; Honeydukes and the Shrieking Shack were also within walking distance and offering easy passage into Hogwarts.

"I think in the circumstances Albus would not say no. There is a clear and present danger to Harry which would justify the extra training and the special treatment." Minnie said enthusiastically.

Sirius was certain that Albus would say yes and offer to help. But if it meant he would get time with Harry while he was at school, Sirius wouldn't complain overly much. He might suggest opening up the training to Harry's friends to mitigate the special treatment issue and that would hopefully put Albus off for a while.

He nodded. "I'll speak with Albus later. We're due to have a War Council at six." He decided a change of subject was in order. "The animagus training is obviously going well."

"Harry is a natural." Minnie gushed – gushed! – and smiled proudly at Harry. "I've rarely used this meditative technique in animagus training but it works wonderfully for him. It seems to be easier than training separate body parts to transform and then to resize the whole." She considered Harry as though contemplating an interesting object. "Perhaps there is a study to be done of the experience. What do you think, Mister Potter?"

Harry looked surprised. "Me?"

"Well, you would need to keep a journal as would I." Minnie suggested. "Publication, of course, would wait until you would want to make your animagus form public."

"Is it really different what I'm doing?" asked Harry, worrying his bottom lip thoughtfully.

"Unique." Minnie said dryly. "You have an instinctive talent, Harry. I actually think you'd have a good chance of transforming into one of the other forms available to you if you meditated on it long enough."

Harry perked up again. "Really? Because I love my raven form but if I could change into the others that would be brilliant."

"Well, let's focus on getting you trained up in the raven form first." Remus said before realising he'd stepped into Minnie's territory and hastily correcting his error. "I mean, if that's what you think, Minerva."

Minnie sent Remus a sharp look to say she wasn't fooled but she nodded. "Quite right, Remus." She turned back to Harry. "We'll get you comfortable with your raven form first before trying any others." She grimaced a little. "And now I think I shall retire to my room and rest for a while."

She turned away the offers to escort her and the three men were left in the sun room feeling rather helpless.

"She is going to be OK, isn't she?" Harry asked worriedly.

"She's going to be fine. She's a tough old cat." Sirius reassured him. "We, Remus and I, thought we might invite her to move in here more permanently – consider it her home away from Hogwarts? What do you think?"

"Sure." Harry nodded.

"You don't have any concerns about living with one of your Professors during the holidays?" asked Remus when Sirius floundered.

Harry shrugged. "If it was Snape maybe."

Sirius gave a dramatic shudder. "Perish the thought."

"And besides, I'm already living with Remus and he was a Professor," Harry pointed out with simple logic, "*and* she was Dad's godmother and my Gran's best friend, and I think they'd want us to be Aunt Minnie's family. Right?"

"Right." Sirius said faintly.

"Can I take my Firebolt out?" asked Harry abruptly.

Sirius narrowed his eyes. "I thought we agreed you were grounded."

And there they were; those green eyes of pleading doom.

"Harry." Sirius said warningly.

Harry gave in, folding his arms tightly over his chest.

Sirius sighed and reached over to drag his son into a hug. "I love you, you know that, right?"

"I know." Harry said, his arms creeping around Sirius to return the embrace. "And I know I'm grounded and why. I shouldn't have gone chasing after the guy."

"We all made mistakes yesterday." Sirius allowed, tightening his hold. "At least going after the Weasleys helped saved their lives but you have to stop putting yourself at risk." He gave another sigh. "But I have to make better decisions about your safety too."

He didn't want to fall into Albus's trap of protecting Harry at the cost of his happiness but neither did he want to indulge Harry too much and risk his life.

And speaking of indulging…

"One hour on your Firebolt."

Harry yanked himself backwards in surprise before he hugged Sirius hard enough to drive the breath from Sirius's body. Harry dived out of the door before Sirius could say another word, obviously deciding that he should act before Sirius changed his mind. Hedwig followed no doubt to keep an eye on him in the sky.

Remus waited until Harry was gone before he raised an eyebrow knowingly at Sirius.

"Don't say it!" barked Sirius.

He gathered what was left of his dignity and made for his study. He was not a soft touch just because he let Harry go out on his broom. He was simply allowing Harry some freedom since Harry would be going nowhere else for the remainder of the Summer except to Black Manor for his lessons. Sirius was a perfectly responsible parent.

His chest ached anew at the memory of the night before; at the thought of losing Harry; the panic and the terror he'd felt when he'd realised Harry had gone after the rogue.

He took a deep breath.

Harry was safe.

That was all that mattered.

Sirius's jaw clenched with determination. They wouldn't make the same mistakes again.
