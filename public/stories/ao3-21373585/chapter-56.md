**(** **Unknown Musutafu Apartment** **)**

  
  

Kaina sat down at her kotatsu, plate of seared salmon in hand as she turned on the TV. As hoped, the first thing to appear was the charity gala, the headline *“Assassination Attempt on All Might”* running along the bottom of the screen. 

She smiled to herself, bringing her food to her lips just as the familiar sound of an opening portal appeared near her front door. 

“Knock!” she yelled before anyone could come through.

Tomura’s fist slowly came out of the portal, hitting the floor hard and slowly three times. That probably wasn’t a good sign. His body emerged from the vortex, his glare piercing through the hand on his face and shaggy hair. 

“...What the fuck was that?”

Kaina took a bite of her food, remaining expressionless as she stared at him, “I believe a part of our deal was I didn’t have to disclose any details of my plans.”

“You shot at him. You go after the HPSC, not him.”

“You should be fully aware I wouldn’t shoot at All Might. He was my friend.” Tomura shook his head, pacing and forth. Kaina peered at him, seeing him far more stressed than she thought he’d be. 

“Exactly,” Tomura stopped his pacing, turning back to her. “You were telling him you broke out. You wanted him to see the bullet.”

Kaina squinted at him, something finally clicking in her head, “...And you broke me out to get to him.”

“Wow, you figured out the guy who tried to kill All Might is trying to get to him. What do you want? A cookie?”

Kaina rolled her eyes before asking, “If you wanted him to know I broke out, why the fuck are you mad that I told him?”

“I wouldn’t be, if All Might would actually believe you’d shoot at him. You might as well have walked up to him and hugged him. The idea was that he’s supposed to think you work for us.”

“And, he still might.” Kaina stood up, mostly because she wanted to be ready in case Tomura decided she wasn’t worth the trouble anymore. “I gave him no indication that I wasn’t working with you, which I’m not.”

“Oh, for the love of-”

“Working with you and being his friend aren’t mutually exclusive.”

Tomura’s eyes shifted around, his brow furrowed, “...I’m pretty sure it is.”

“Not if it’s a means to an end. Which, again, it is. Is all this really just to be fucking petty? Just to make him sad?”

“Oh, no. I really do need the HPSC off my back. That’s the main benefit of this, and you’re doing that perfectly. But, is it really so wrong to also do a little something for myself? Just stick to the HPSC, okay? They’re gonna know you escaped now, which I really hope was a part of the plan.”

Kaina watched as Tomura pulled out his phone, texting Kurogiri for an exit. A portal swirled open near the door, with the young man heading towards it. “...Why do you hate him?”

Tomura stopped, looking back at Kaina with a smirk, “...I believe a part of our deal was I didn’t have to disclose any details of my plans.”

He took his leave, vanishing into the darkness.

**(** **Night: Heights Alliance: 1-A Dorms)**

  
  

Unaware of the trouble in Tokyo, Class 1A was celebrating their victory. 

(Almost) Every single one of them had passed. Momo had taken it upon herself to order food to the dorms. When everyone had tried to give their order, she simply said she ordered everything the restaurant had three-times over. 

Now, everyone was hanging around the main common room, their voices echoing and overlapping over each other as they chatted away. The couple and their friends sat at one of the groups of couches, empty food containers on the coffee table in front of them. 

Despite mostly being public, Izuku and Kyouka kept their intertwined hands mostly hidden between their bodies. Everyone had changed out of their uniforms a while ago. Izuku was wearing a very dark green, long-sleeve shirt and black jeans. Kyouka was in lace-up combat boots, black jeans, a navy blue polo, a black choker and a buckle bracelet. 

“You scored a ninety-four?” Kyouka stared baffled at Momo. “Izuku said *one* semi-negative thing to that kid, and we got a ninety-one! What the hell is the scoring system?”

Shoto raised a brow at her, “You’re complaining about a ninety-one?”

“I…” Kyouka slumped back into the couch, a pout on her lips, “No…”

“To be fair, the scoring was quite vague,” Tenya interjected. “But, the point was to see how ready we were for emergency situations. If we knew what we were being scored on, everyone would change how they would react spontaneously.”

“Except Bakugou,” Kyouka chuckled. 

Ochako shifted her eyes to the side, seeing Katsuki at the other group of couches barely even ten-feet away, staring blankly at nothing. “...You know he could probably hear you, right?”

“Wouldn’t have said it if he couldn’t,” she smiled proudly.

Momo sighed, beginning to collect the containers on the table and keeping her voice low, “I know we’re not privy to the whole story, but I hope you all settle your differences someday.”

Izuku opened his mouth, but Kyouka beat him to it, “Trust me, that ship has sailed.”

“Kyouka…” Izuku squeezed her hand, brows knitted together.

“It has for me,” Kyouka held firm, leaning in close to Izuku and whispering, “ *It should for you too. Soon, at least. He’s had more than enough chances.”*

Izuku bit the inside of his cheek as fell into deep thought, beginning to collect the trash with everyone else. He knew Kyouka’s hate for Katsuki ran deep. After Aldera, she truly was done. If Katsuki was on fire, she’d still get the fire extinguisher, but she’d just throw it at his head.

Deep down, he knew she was probably right. 

He had absolutely no time for Katsuki and all of the baggage that came with it. Whatever form of making amends he was looking for with Katsuki, the blonde didn’t have it, and had no interest in gaining it. Izuku had a great many more important things to worry about. 

If he had to permanently go his separate ways with Katsuki, then so be it…

However…

It just felt wrong to leave things like this. He didn’t want this loose thread for the rest of his life. 

But, he didn’t have a choice. This was a situation where it required cooperation. It was up to Kacchan to bother trying.

Everyone began heading towards the kitchen to start the clean-up, and as Izuku made it past the couch, Katsuki brushed by his shoulder. 

“Meet me at Ground Beta after curfew,” Katsuki said as he walked by, not meeting Izuku’s eyes. “We need to talk.”

Izuku watched him disappear from the common room, heading towards the stairs.

…He had a strong feeling he and Bakugou didn’t have the same talk in mind.

**(** **Midoriya Family Apartment** **)**

  
  

Hisashi sat on his couch as Toshinori paced back and forth in front of him, the small pink and indigo bullet rolling between his fingers. Inko stood behind the couch, watching the two men sort out the situations in their minds.

Toshinori pocketed his hands, but kept pacing, “You’ve been silent for almost five minutes.”

“I’m…processing,” Hisashi shook his head, clicking his teeth together. “I mean, forgive me, but it’s a lot.”

“By ‘processing’, do you mean you’re trying to decide if you believe me or not?”

“No, no, I…A little.” The remote on the coffee table suddenly flung back and smacked Hisashi in the face, “Ow! What the-?!”

He turned around, seeing Inko’s hand outstretched, “Hisashi…”

“I’m sorry, but assassins? I mean, do I believe that the government —or every government, for that matter— would hire assassins to keep the peace and their secrets? Yeah, probably. Do I know that the most important thing to the HPSC is their image and maintaining the perfect status quo? Yes, I do. Did I find the murder of the old chairman extremely suspicious? Yes, I did. But…”

“...”

“...”

All Might raised a brow, “...But?”

“I completely forgot what my point was. I guess I do believe you.”

“Yes!” All Might pumped his fist. “So, you’ll help me?”

“Just hold on, I don’t even know what I would be doing. Actually, I don’t even know why you chose me of all people. I *am* an HPSC member. I have been for twenty-years, so wouldn’t I be at the top of your list of people not to trust?”

“Well, despite only speaking once, you’re the only HPSC member I  actually can trust. I’ve known your son for quite some time now, and I don’t think anyone corrupt could’ve possibly helped raise that boy. You’re also a high-enough ranking member that you have access to files and resources that we need.”

“There’s no way I have access to those kinds of files, especially since they definitely don’t exist anymore.”

“There’s always a trail.”

“It’s a government’s job to get rid of trails, especially their own.”

“Well, nobody’s perfect. Mistakes are always made, especially when their mistakes take them by surprise by shooting their leader in the face. Listen, I…” Toshinori sighed, sitting on the coffee table across the Hisashi, leaning forward to address him directly. “I know I’m asking a lot. But, I-...I don’t know who else to turn to. In terms of having someone on the inside, you’re all I got. Say no, and I’ll never bring this up again. But, I don’t think I can do this alone. Kaina was my closest friend, and I refuse to let her suffering go unpunished.”

Hisashi rubbed his hands together, staring down at the floor as he thought. Solving investigations in both crime and deep-seeded legals matters was his profession, but it was always to protect HPSC’s interests. 

But, it was also to protect the people who were unaware victims…

This was going against his own government, though. At least, a part of it, but a very powerful part of it. This would be the most he’s ever put his life on the line. Not just his own life, either…

“This could put my family in danger, if we’re caught. They wouldn’t want any information leaking out.”

“Not once we become known associates to them,” All Might shrugged. “You know my reputation there.”

“Hmhm, yep. They call you their ‘Golden Boy’. They wouldn’t dare touch you, even retired. Hell, they would give anything just for you to unretire. They’ll never arrest you for anything, it would cause an international panic.”

“Can’t kill me either, not now. They’re still licking their wounds, trying to keep an image of peace and stability. They need me around. Admittedly, I am self-aware enough to understand that even retired I bring a sense of comfort to the public. As long as I’m alive, there’s hope I can swoop in and save the day again. If you and I stick together, they’ll stay away.”

“But, that just means they might go after my family to get to me. I just got back after being gone for so long, I shouldn’t go right back to working-”

“We’ll be fine,” Inko cut in, both men turning to look at her, determination on her face as she looked to her husband. “Unfortunately, this family has become pretty acquainted with danger. Izuku and Kyouka can do far more than just protect themselves. They can protect me, too. It’s dangerous, but we both know you won’t be able to just sit by and do nothing. Not after learning all this.”

Hisashi smiled at his wife, reaching back over the couch and taking her hand, “You’re sure?”

“My husband might save Japan from its own corrupt government and my son and future daughter-in-law are probably going to be the number one heroes. I’d say in comparison I’m falling behind in the heroics department, so I have to be brave in some way.”

“You raised Izuku. That takes more bravery than anyone else has.” Hisashi turned back to All Might, going back to the topic at hand. “If we were successful, and that’s a big ‘if’ saying that our opponent is a whole government branch, then this would cause an entire government shutdown for who knows how long? Not to mention, and this is by no means a jab at your friend, but…she *did* still murder the chairman. I don’t know if this can end with her going free.”

“I…” Toshinori hung his head, “I know.”

“There’s also another problem. The last time there was any sign of the League of Villains, it was with three Tartarus guards. They claimed the League broke into their homes, knocked them out, and they all woke up a couple days later. But, apparently, each of them signed into work the next day. They were all on camera, all doing their jobs as normal. But, none of them remember any of it. So, I-...I’m obviously not the best judge of Ms. Tsutsumi’s character, but-”

“She might be working for them…” Toshinori rubbed his hands together anxiously, clearing his throat and shaking his head. “No. No, I’m telling you that Kaina *does not* miss, unless on purpose. That bullet was never meant to hit me.”

“I-...All Might, she’s been in prison for six years, she’s out of practice. And, if everything we suspect is true, then…Well, she’s probably not a big fan of society as it is. The League probably offered-”

“We’ll cross that bridge when we get there,” Toshinori cut him off. Hisashi pursed his lips, deciding to turn the conversation back to something more positive.

“...I suppose we could push for entrapment. It’s…Well, calling that a hard sell is an understatement, but if we can prove that she was somehow tricked or forced somehow, then who knows?”

Toshinori raised his head, his brows raising in a slight burst of hope, “What about her lack of trial?”

Hisashi’s brow knit together, “She didn’t get a trial? Even the guiltiest get a trial, even if a short one. No court appearance whatsoever?”

“No. If she had one, I absolutely would’ve been there.”

“Huh…” Hisashi rubbed his chin as he thought, something Toshinori couldn’t help but notice was one of the same habits Izuku did. “No investigation, placed in Tartarus without a trial…We might even be able to push for a mistrial. We’ll definitely need more than just this, but it’s possible.”

“But, to expose the HPSC, wouldn’t she have to admit to everything she’s done?”

“Yeah, but that’s a bridge we’ll have to cross when we get there. We need to actually find her first, along with more evidence.”

Toshinori smiled, “I take it this means you’re in?”

“W-Well, I mean, it’s like I said before. Working a case with All Might was my dream. Against my own employer? That wasn’t exactly my first thought, but…” Hisashi reached his hand out to him. “I suppose I’ll take what I can get. What’s more heroic than purging corruption from society?...Uh, that sounded kinda like the Hero Killer. I-I just mean-”

“I get it,” Toshinori chuckled, shaking Hisashi’s hand. “You’ve got no idea how grateful I am.”

“Are you kidding? I’m quite literally barely holding myself together in excitement. I mean, I’m kinda terrified, especially now that I know the HPSC has assassins that are apparently so good that nobody ever knew about them. Huh, saying that out loud kinda made it worse, but I’m still gonna do it. I’m rambling…”

Inko leaned down, patting her husband's arm, “You’re also still shaking his hand.”

Hisashi quickly retracted his hand, clearing his throat, “ *Ahem* . I know this is all very personal for you, but I think my son should know about this. I think it’s more dangerous if he’s caught unprepared if this goes to hell.”

…Toshinori had to admit, this whole time he had kind of forgotten Hisashi didn’t know about One For All. He had just gotten really lucky that he didn’t mention anything about it. 

Toshinori shared a quick look with Inko before nodding his head, “Yes, of course. I’m the one coming to you with this trouble. I would trust that young man with my life, so I know I can trust him with my secret.”

“I’ll wait a bit, though. I’m sure he’s busy celebrating right now.”

**(** **UA Dorms: AMP’s Room** **)**

  
  

“Absolutely not,” Kyouka shook her head, pacing back and forth in front of Izuku as he sat on their bed. “We can’t indulge him, not even a little bit. The bastard doesn’t deserve another attosecond of your time.”

“What if it’s important?”

“I counter with my own question. Why is he asking you to come to Ground Beta? If it’s something really important, he can ask you literally anywhere that’s private. Like, I dunno, your room? Also, let’s be real, it’s Bakugou. He doesn’t know how to talk like a human-being, and he would *never* ask you for help. *Never.* He’s bringing you out there to fight.”

  
“He…” Izuku ran his hand down his face with a sigh, “...probably is. It’s where I beat him in Battle Training. Outside of the preliminary exams, it’s the first time I’ve ever beaten him at something.”

“Grrah! I *hate* this prick! Why can’t he just leave us be? We haven’t talked to him since Kamino, and that was just fine.”

“...You do still antagonize him quite a bit.”

“I-...Yeah, I know. But, that’s us. He and I are a different story. We don’t have an eleven-year history. You two do. He was the abuser, yet he’s the one that can’t move on from it.”

“We both know I haven’t either, Kyouka.”

“Well, you’re doing a lot better than him. You’re trying to solve your issues without keeping him down and insulting him...That’s my job.” 

Izuku chuckled dryly, shaking his head, “I don’t know. If he needs help, then I’m more than willing. But, I can’t help but have a strong feeling it’s not about that.”

Kyouka stopped her pacing, sighing as she turned to Izuku, “...I’ll go.”

His brows rose, gazing at her in shock, “That sounds like it’ll only end terribly.”

“I’ll go, see what he wants. If it’s actually something important,— no matter how much I doubt it— then I’ll call for you. Otherwise, that dick can kick rocks all he wants in his own little pity corner.”

“What if he doesn’t want to speak to you? Wait, what am I saying? He definitely won’t wanna speak to you.”

“Then, it must not be that important, is it? He can swallow his pride for one minute, and explain what he needs. Or, he’s all alone. He’s pretty insistent on doing everything by himself, his only answer being to blow up anything in his way.” Kyouka got down in front of Izuku, taking his hands in her own. “I know you can’t stop yourself from helping people, even assholes like him. I hate him, but if he really needs something important, I’ll be standing right next to you when he needs us. But, if he’s really just trying to get at you, fight you, anything of the sort, then I refuse to let him take up any more of your time. He doesn’t deserve it, and you don’t deserve the stress. We have so much going on in our lives right now, and you shouldn’t have to add all of his bullshit to your list of worries.”

Izuku bit the inside of his cheek, “...I know.”

“I made a promise to myself that I wouldn’t let him hurt you, and that was *before* we went to Aldera and I saw just a fraction of the shit he did. Never. Again. Tell me to stay here, I will. But, I’m asking that you let me go in your place first.” 

“I…I would rather neither of us go than .”

“That’s perfectly fine with me, but I know you’re not gonna sleep tonight if we do nothing. I also know that Bakugou won’t let that go.” She could still see Izuku so conflicted, and she understood. She was aware that she was asking him to go completely against his nature. But, she knew that Izuku going to see Bakugou wasn’t gonna end well. Her hope was to avoid it, but if things did turn bad, she’d rather be on the receiving end instead of Izuku. He had gone through enough with that dickhead. Kyouka took Izuku’s face in her hands, looking him in the eyes, “If our roles were reversed, would you want me to go?”

Izuku opened his mouth to retort, but he only sighed, “...No. No, I wouldn’t.”

“If it’s actually important, I’ll call you in an instant, I promise. If it’s somehow an apology of any kind, I’ll bring him to you myself, and then we’ll know we live in a simulation and that was a glitch.” They both chuckled just a bit at that. Kyouka pressed their foreheads together, her thumb caressing his cheek. “I’m just gonna see what he wants. When it’s nothing important, I’m coming right back, and we’re gonna continue celebrating.”

“...What if I sit outside of Ground Beta?”

“One of the first thing’s he’ll do is think you’re waiting nearby and look for you. And, if he and I leave at the same time, he’s just gonna see you standing there and then still get what he wants. You know I can handle that idiot.”

Izuku closed his eyes, taking a deep breath before finally nodding his head, “...Alright. But, at least be a bit civil, unless he antagonizes you.”

“I only promise to try.”

“...So, no?”

“I will not call him any names.”

“That’s the best I’m getting, isn’t it?”

“It’s the best I’m physically capable of.”

  
  
  

***~...AMP…~***

  
  
  

**(** **Some Time Later: Ground Beta** **)**

  
  
  

Katsuki stared up at the building he and Deku had fought in, thinking back to that day. It wasn’t even a fight, really. Deku won from using the capture tape. He had been so focused on getting an actual fight that he didn’t even think the tape was a factor. 

Just another mistake…

Katsuki suddenly heard footsteps, turning around and instantly glaring at who was approaching him. “Oh for the love of-...Why did I know it’d be you that showed up?”

Kyouka made it to him and crossed her arms, keeping a complete deadpan expression as she addressed him, “Because hopefully you’re not as dumb as you probably are…Wow, took me five seconds to break the promise of being civil.”

Katsuki rolled his eyes, dismissively waving her off, “I’m not doing this with you tonight. Let’s cut the bullshit. Just go get your worthless boyfriend. He’s probably hiding around here, isn’t he?”

“Mm, yeah, I don’t think so. I have a much better idea. Tell me what you want, and I’ll consider telling Izuku about it. *If* it’s actually worth his time.”

Katsuki scoffed, “I can’t tell if you're his secretary or his master. You’re testing my patience, Earlobes.”

“Yeah? Well I’m all out of damn patience. I told you back at Kamino that you’re well past being on thin ice. I had hoped you picked up on the fact that what I was really not-so-subtley saying was ‘fuck off’.”

“Oh yeah, I picked up on it. Loud and clear, Earlobes. But, that was you saying it, and I don’t remember asking you to come here. Deku’s the one I need to talk to, and I’m going to do so whether you like it or not. 

Katsuki began to walk forward, intending to go around her and trek back to the dorms to get Izuku. But, Kyouka stepped to the side, stopping the blonde and demanding his attention once more, “I know you don’t care about Izuku’s— or really anyone’s— feelings, but he quite literally has a *thousand* bigger things on his mind than you. He’s stressed. You and your bullshit are the absolute last thing he needs right now.”

“Uh-huh? I would imagine it must be pretty stressful having All Might’s quirk.”

“Yo-...” Kyouka froze, doing her best to quickly mask her shock with confusion. There was no way. One For All had to be screwing with her jacks again. “Wh-...What?”

“Skip the song and dance. I know, and he absolutely told you a long time ago. Or, at least I’m pretty sure I figured it out. Either way, you can see why I need to talk to him.”

“WaitWaitWait. All Might’s quirk? What the Hell are you talking about?”

Katsuki shoved his hands into his pockets, fully turning to Kyouka as he laid it all out, “Back at the Sports Festival, he told me that he didn’t hide his quirk. And, you know, for a second I thought he was bullshitting me. But, then I realized there was no way he would hide a quirk. It was all that freak would ever talk about. So, what was it then? I heard about his little story of his quirk not appearing until he was fifteen. ‘Not showing up until he was physically able to handle it’, or whatever? I’ll admit, I believed that for a second. I mean, he was always a little shrimp. But, something was just prodding at the back of my mind…Kamino.”

*‘Fucking Shigaraki,’* Kyouka internally cursed, keeping her face as neutral as possible.

“Constantly covering my ears so I wouldn’t hear what you guys were talking about was suspicious already, but what I did hear was more. The bad guy from Kamino was Shigaraki’s master, said so himself. From how Handsy spoke, and how All Might and that villain interacted, it was like they knew each other. Shigaraki called you guys cousins, and that both he and Deku got a ‘promotion’ that night. The night when that guy’s master was beaten, and the night All Might’s career ended.”

*‘I’m going to choke Shigaraki with his own hands.’*

“When I remembered that, things started to click. Deku got his quirk when he was fourteen? That was right around when All Might came back to Musutafu. I’d even guess it was the day All Might saved us from the sludge guy. Then, there was Icy Hot’s whole spiel back at the Sports Festival too. You can’t deny that one, you were there too. He said how the pressure and static in the air changed when both All Might and Deku used their quirks. And, you know what? When I fought him, I realized that bicolored bastard was right. It felt the exact same.” Katsuki stepped forward, looking down at Kyouka with a scowl. Kyouka gave no ground, both glaring at one another like they were trying to burn holes in each other’s heads. “I got no fucking clue how, but that runt has All Might’s quirk. I know that you know too. I’m gonna talk to that piece of shit. So, are you going to go get him, or am I?”

Kyouka definitely couldn’t add ‘actor’ to her list of talents, but she did her absolute damndest. “Wow, I…I thought you were stupid, but wow. I mean, *wow.* You’re actually that dumb.”

Katsuki raised a brow, his curiosity just barely edging out his irritation, “What now?”

“You can’t just give quirks away, moron.”

“You sure about that? Remember the USJ? That nomu thing had multiple quirks. The guy All Might fought did too. If all of you are in the same little secret clique, then I’d wager you know how they did it.”

“Really? Even if that villain can take quirks or something, then how does All Might have the same power, *on top* of the power he’s already got? Where does Izuku’s lightning and stuff come from? How did All Might still have powers even after your hypothetical quirk transfer thing?”

“I don’t know!” Katsuki yelled, his fists clenched, “I don’t fucking know, but I don’t need all the puzzle pieces to see the full picture! He has All Might’s quirk, and I need some answers!”

Kyouka threw her arms out, shouting right back, “What answers?! Answers to your bullshit theory?! And you know what? Let’s imagine a world where everything you said didn’t sound batshit crazy, okay? What *exactly* does Izuku have to tell you? What answers does he owe you?! He owes you *nothing!* The only thing owed here is your apology! You keep talking about that night at Kamino, and yet you *refuse* to even mention anything that happened at Aldera! Everything *you* did!”

“That’s got nothing to do with this!”

“Really? It doesn’t? I’d argue it has everything to do with this! It’s had everything to do with you two for almost twelve damn years! Because let me take a quick guess here, correct me if I’m wrong. You want to know why All Might would ever give his quirk to Izuku, even hypothetically! You can’t get past the idea that maybe— just maybe— he’s far and above a better man than you ever were, will be, and ever could even try to be. You can’t stand that All Might could even possibly see something in him, and *not you* . You, and your pride, your ego, your superiority complex, and your overall just being a piece of human garbage that gets away with *everything!* Uh-huh, yeah, I totally can’t see why All Might would like Izuku more than you. Oh, hold on, let me see if I can get some bonus points. You planned to take Izuku here, Ground Beta, the place where he beat you during the Battle Trials. Your anger-issue filled, hormone-imbalance brain probably wanted to take him all the way out here to fight him, right?”

“...”

“What do I win?”

Katsuki breathed in deep, his hands clawed near his chest as he clenched his eyes shut. He had to admit, nobody besides Deku infuriated him so much. She despised him to her core, and she committed to that hatred. His distaste for her was apathetic to irritation at best, but she was doing her best to make him match her output of dislike. 

“Fuck. Off. I’m going to get him.”

Katsuki pushed past her, making his way back towards the entrance. But, Kyouka’s jack slung back, wrapped around Katsuki, and threw him back in front of her. Katsuki stumbled backwards, regaining his footing as he stared confused at Kyouka. He didn’t pay attention to his classmates much, but he definitely didn’t remember her jacks being *that* strong.

Kyouka shook her head, glaring him down, “I made a promise that I wouldn’t let you hurt Izuku ever again. You’re not getting near him.”

“Move, Earlobes.”

“Just go back to what you were doing— what we were all doing— and live and let live. Go back to our bubbles, and stay away from each other.”

“Not without my rematch.”

Kyouka scoffed, rolling her eyes, “There it is. You really want to go over the Battle Trials again? What? Do you have a fake bomb in the building?”

“Not the damn Battle Trials. The Sports Festival.”

“The Sports Festi-? You won that!”

“No, I didn’t.” Katsuki scowled at the ground, the image of Deku’s smile after their fight. “He was using only a fraction of his power, he saw me as a fucking stepping stone. If he has All Might’s power, then how the Hell did he lose? I want my fight, a real fight this time. Now move.”

“A stepping stone? You know that Izuku would neve-...You know what? We’re not going anywhere until you drop this. I got all night.”

“Yeah, well I don’t. So, move.” Katsuki began walking again, but Kyouka stepped in front of him, her jacks extending out on either side of her. “Out of my fucking way!”

“Back. Off. You’re not getting your fight. Even if you got Izuku out here, he won’t wanna fight you. He’ll fight you out of *pity* . Is that what you want? A pity fight?”

“Pity?” Katsuki scoffed, a look of what Kyouka could only describe as pure disgust on the blonde’s face. “ *Pity?”*

“Yeah, I don’t get it either. But, Izuku would still pity the asshole who got everything he ever wanted, and deprived him of the same.”

“I didn-!” Katsuki stopped himself, trying to think of his next words carefully. But, everything he could think of just felt wrong, conflicting. “I didn’t…”

“Didn’t what? Huh? Didn’t think your constant torture of him would hurt him so bad? Didn’t think his life mattered? C’mon, tell me, you piece of shit!”

“...”

“You know what? To Hell with an apology, it’s not like you’d even mean it! You should be *thanking* him! I would’ve told everyone all about you a long time ago, but Izuku just won’t do it. He doesn’t want to hurt you! Heaven forbid he let his bully ever get what he deserves, because he’s so damn pure. He has the power to throw your hero career in the trash, and he never will!”

“I didn’t ask him to do that!”

“Oh, but you’re so relieved, aren’t you? So happy that you got away *again!* At this point, would telling anybody even do anything? Not like we have proof. It’s not like they can kick you out. But, you know what it would do? Everyone would know what you are; what you *really* are. I don’t care if you graduate. I don’t care if you rank number one in the entire damn world…” Kyouka glared up at him, seething through grit teeth. *“You’re* ***never*** *gonna be a real hero.”* 

“SHUT UP!!!” Katsuki blasted her to the side. Kyouka tumbled back, a smoke trail following her as she rolled and regained her footing. It was a light blast, not meant to actually harm. 

…Didn’t stop her from being absolutely livid.

"Enough of this! Stop distracting me! Stop defending that nerd! I know he's hiding something! Stay outta my wa-!" 

Kyouka’s jack suddenly shot forward and jabbed into his inner thigh. Katsuki’s leg failed him, allowing Kyouka to charge forward and slam her fist into his face. Katsuki stumbled back and rubbed his chin as pain radiated throughout his jaw. Earlobes was certainly much stronger than she looked.

"I didn't ask for a fight, asshole! I told you to stay away! But I'll be completely honest with you, *Kacchan* ..." Kyouka's jacks raised up, her body lowering into a more sturdy stance. "I've been wanting to punch you for a long time. You really wanna massage your ego by fighting Izuku? I've got something better. I won't give you the satisfaction, and I'll be the one who beats you."

Katsuki raised a brow, bursting out in laughter, " *You* ? Look, even I'll admit you're not one of the useless ones around here, but-"

"But nothing! You'd be surprised just how badly I can kick your ass. Don’t be afraid to hit a girl, either…Oh, who am I kidding? Even if you could ever get a woman to like you, you’re a walking domestic abuse charge."

Katsuki deadpanned, deciding it was better to not dignify that, “I ain’t gonna fight you. Wouldn’t even be a fight.”

“Huh, guess you’re right. I mean, you were the guy that couldn’t even pass the License Exams while I fought a hero in the top ten. I wouldn’t wanna hurt what little pride you have left in your sad excuse of a soul.” 

“...You know what? Fine. You’ve been a pain in my ass since the beginning, and I could use a warm-up before I fight the nerd. And, fighting you? That’s a sure-fire way for Deku to want to fight me. But, just remember, when he asks what happened…” Katsuki got down, his hands behind him as sparks popped against his palm. “...You asked for this.”

***\*BOOM!!!\****

Katsuki launched at Kyouka in a streak of light, billowing smoke behind him as he brought his hand out towards Kyouka quickly approaching face. He would never admit this to Earlobe’s face, but he knew she was a whole lot tougher than she looked. 

For starters, she picked a fight with him without hesitation. Chick had guts, no doubt about it. 

But, he also knew she had fought both All Might, the Hero Killer, and Gang Orca. Sure, Deku was there for all of those, but still. She could take hits as well as she could give them out, so he didn’t feel any remorse using his explosions on her. He’d hold back, this was nothing but a warm-up for him anyway. But, he’d still enjoy this.

Now, *how* exactly was she that strong? He truly didn’t know. 

He thrusted his hand forward, sparks flying and a small explosion lighting up the dark street. But, Kyouka had dodged just slightly, Katsuki’s hand moving right back her head.

…And, she was apparently fast too. What the fuck? How the hell did she dodge that?

The only answer he received was his arm captured by Kyouka’s jacks, swinging him around and sending him careening into a bike rack, a metal reverb pinging in the air as his body hit the metal.

“You know, just because you’re not fighting Izuku doesn’t mean you can still start every fight with a right hook.”

Katsuki groaned in annoyance as he got back up, “Of course he told you that.”

“He told you to, but clearly you didn’t listen hard enough.” She smiled, her jacks slamming into the street. “Maybe you’ll listen to this.”

The roads broke open into a million pieces as a shockwave ran through the ground, directed right at Katsuki. The blonde shot himself up to avoid the hit, using his explosions to spin him in the air towards Kyouka, his sparking palm coming down her. 

Kyouka jumped back, but the explosion was too big. She flew back, slamming into the wall of the building. Katsuki was quickly on her, his explosions trailing behind him, grabbing her shirt and throwing Kyouka over his shoulder and onto the ground.

He fired his explosions again, sending Kyouka back to the other side of the street. 

“You’re way outta your league, Earlobes. All you had to do was go get Deku,” Katsuki chuckled, sparks popping in his palm. Kyouka quickly got back up, ignoring the smell of her singed clothes and forced her jacks into the ground again, with Katsuki just smiling in response as blasted himself into the air again, curving around to the right in a crescent of bright lights and smoke, with a wide kick towards Kyouka. “Should’ve listened to yourself about using the same moves over and over!”

“I did!” Kyouka’s jacks had snaked their way through the earth, curving back up to aim towards the sky. Soundwaves erupted from her jacks, sending both sound and chunks of the road up and into Katsuki like a shotgun. He was pelted, his assault completely thrown off, causing him to falter in his flight-path. His ears ringing, and cuts riddling his body, he fell towards Kyouka.

She rushed him, her fist pulled back and firing right into Katsuki’s diaphragm at full force as he essentially fell right into her attack. 

Her jacks wrapped around both of Katsuki’s wrists while her free hand clutched his face, slamming his head onto the street. 

Now, was Bakugou right? Was she outclassed?

Yeah, probably.

But, damn, finally getting to truly hit the motherfucker felt *good.*

Katsuki kicked her stomach, knocking her back, but Kyouka’s jacks remained firmly wrapped around his wrists. He was yanked with her, causing them to end up in a grapple, which Kyouka won due to the blonde’s restrained arms. 

Kyouka locked her arm around Katsuki’s neck, her free hand slamming into his cheekbone. Katsuki couldn’t reach his arm back to blast her, so he opted to just open his palm and fire away.

Another explosion rocked the night sky, both launching back into the building behind them. They crashed through the glass doors, tumbling into the lobby of a replica office in a heap of limbs and smoke. Katsuki growled as he shook glass out of his spiky hair, pushing himself up, free of Kyouka’s grasp. 

Why the fuck was this so much more difficult than he expected? He knew not to underestimate her, but this was fucking ridiculous. 

Just as he got his foot underneath him, Kyouka’s jacks shot out and pressed directly to the back of his knees, vibrating his legs and causing them to fail. He fell back down on all fours as Kyouka managed to get up first. 

She rushed forward and kicked his ribs. Katsuki grunted as pain radiated throughout his side, he pivoted, seeing Kyouka’s fist coming right for his face. He caught her hand, but his punch just pushed his hand back into his eye.

Why the *fuck* was she so strong?

One of jacks jabbed all across his body at a surprising pace, his body involuntarily reacting to every hit, while the other wrapped around his arm to keep it in place as Kyouka used her other hand to keep punching. 

Katsuki screamed in irritation, his explosions sparking against Kyouka’s fist, but she didn’t seem to care as she kept wailing away. He managed to grab the assailing jack and yank Kyouka’s head down, headbutting her nose. He shoulder-charged her, his hand glowing brightly as he placed it directly on her stomach.

The explosion shook the floor and shattered the windows on the first floor. Kyouka went flying back and hit one of the desks, rolling over and falling onto the floor in a puff of smoke. 

Katsuki ran after her and shoved the desk outta the way, but he found Kyouka was gone. He could’ve sworn he saw a flash of purple light for just a split-second, but he wasn’t sure. Suddenly, he heard Kyouka’s voice behind him. 

“Got no idea how long I’ve been waiting to do this…”

He growled, pivoting around with sparks popping in his hand, finding his opponent behind him. He was about to thrust his hand forward when…

Wait, were his feet not touching the ground?

His world slowed down, intense, sharp pain radiating from below his waist as the rest of his body went numb. He looked down, finding Kyouka’s boot firmly planted between his legs.

Oh…

Katsuki shot up, his head hitting the ceiling, and landing back down on the floor in a crumpled heap. How her kick was that strong, he didn’t know. But, he couldn’t exactly think about that at that very second. He couldn’t think about anything as the edges of his vision flashed white, stars in his vision and ringing in his ears. 

He could only muster up a quiet, high-pitched voice, *“Fuck…you…”*  

“Ahahaha! FINALLY!!! You have absolutely no idea how long I’ve been waiting to do that. Outside of meeting Izuku, this is the best day of my life.” Kyouka breathed in deep, a wide smile on her face as she bellowed out a satisfied and hearty laugh, wiping away the blood dripping from her nose. She crouched down, flicking Katsuki’s forehead, “You still gonna try to talk to Izuku? I can keep kicking if you want.”

“You…ain’t winning…just because you take cheap shots.”

Kyouka’s smirk was instantly replaced with a sneer, “Cheap shots? So, what do you call beating on a defenseless kid for eleven years? A fair fight? Honorable? I wonder what Aizawa would say about that. Oh, even better. I wonder what All Might would say about you.”

Katsuki growled, his palms popping with sparks as he mustered up the strength to ignore his still lingering pain from below. But, Kyouka grabbed his head, pushing him back down against the floor, her quickly jacks wrapping around his body to keep his arms in place. 

Again, he repeated: Why the *fuck* was she this strong?

“You know, at this point, I know this is just catharsis. You’re not gonna learn anything from this. You don’t care, cause nobody else’s feelings have ever affected you. You’re a fucking psycho, poorly masquerading as someone who wants to help people. You’re just in this because it’s the only way you can legally beat the shit outta people. The fact that All Might of all people is your favorite hero is just sad. By that, I mean *he* would be sad that he inspired a piece-of-shit like you.”

“SHUT!!! UP!!!” At this point, Katsuki was practically foaming at the mouth. The sparks on his hands popped brighter than before, concentrated as tiny, intense blasts. His hands were stuck to his sides, but he didn’t care as he unleashed what was the equivalent of a flashbang into the room.

Kyouka covered her eyes for a split-second, but that was all he needed. 

Katsuki shot his torso up, the back of his head slamming into Kyouka’s face. She stumbled back, her jacks loosening just enough for Katsuki to rip one arm free and grab Kyouka’s shirt. Still stuck to his side and aimed at the ground, his other hand went off at full power, an explosion rocking the building.

They both launched up, the whole first floor filled with a blinding light. Kyouka’s body acted as a battering ram, slamming through floor-after-floor until they reached the roof, the night sky above them. 

They flew high above the building, Katsuki breaking free from her grasp and pivoting them in the air with Kyouka’s back now to the ground. 

He yelled with rage as his hand against Kyouka glowed brightly, the crack of an explosion screaming out into the night as everything shook. Billowing clouds of smoke and orange light erupted against the dark night sky, with Kyouka’s body firing down at the building roof like a bullet. 

Her body smacked into the concrete, a trail of smoke following her body as she rolled limply towards the edge of the roof, stopping just before the edge. 

  
  
  

***~...AMP…~***

  
  
  

**(** **UA Dorms: AMP’s Room** **)**

  
  

Izuku stopped his anxious pacing, the sound of an explosion ringing around in his head. 

…He just imagined that, right? 

He was in his room, far away from Ground Beta. There was no way he heard an explosion, it was impossible. He was just being paranoid, thinking about things going wrong. Yet…

Something felt very wrong. It was more than paranoia, it almost felt like he was fighting Katsuki himself. He remembered he had very similar ticks go off in his head when Kyouka had her thing with Mina in the locker room.

…Yeah, something was wrong.

Izuku was at the balcony screen door in an instant, sliding the glass open and leaping over the railing, falling down to the grass below. Once his feet hit the ground, he was off in a flash of cyan light. 

  
  
  

***~...AMP…~***

  
  

Katsuki fell, landing down on the roof with a grunt and a roll to cushion his fall. He got up, panting and spitting blood out onto the ground. His fists clawed, sparking popping as he began walking towards Kyouka’s…unmoving body.

She wasn’t moving…

Oh, fuck.

With a mix of a sigh and a growl, Katsuki moved toward her body. “For fuck’s sake, you better be faking it, cause I ain’t carrying you back if you’re unconscious.”

Katsuki didn’t even make it a few feet before Kyouka’s jacks suddenly snaked out from under her and pointed right at Katsuki, a short, but intense pulse of soundwaves hitting him. It rocked him so hard his head almost flung back, and his heart palpitated for a few seconds.

Her jacks wrapped around his ankles, yanking his feet out from under him. He was slung into the air, over Kyouka, and slammed down, his head just barely not going over the edge of the building. Her jacks retracted from around Katsuki’s legs, and instead they quickly wrapped around his fists, keeping his hands closed and explosions in check. 

Kyouka was on him in an instant, one foot on his bicep and her other leg’s knee in his stomach. Her right hand clasped down on Katsuki’s face, holding his head down still while her fist reared back. He could see scorch marks on her clothes, her skin covered in scuffs and scratches, blood dripping down from a cut near her hairline, and she was reeking of smoke. 

And, of course, she was absolutely fucking pissed.

With each scream that poured out of her, her hate finally fully unleashed, she slammed her fist straight down onto Katsuki’s face.

“You tortured the person I love!!!”

*\*CRACK\**

“For eleven years!!!”

*\*CRACK\**

“And you don’t even care!!!”

*\*CRACK\**

“You get away with everything!!!”

*\*CRACK\**

“You’re a complete asshole to everyone around you!!!”

*\*CRACK\**

“And everyone somehow still likes you!!!”

*\*CRACK\**

“You never learn!!!”

*\*CRACK\**

“You’re a selfish!!!”

*\*CRACK\**

“Arrogant!!!”

*\*CRACK\**

“Abusive!!!”

*\*CRACK\**

“Narcissistic!!!” 

*\*CRACK\**

“Piece!!!”

*\*CRACK\**

“Of!!!”

*\*CRACK\**

“Fucking!!!”

*\*CRACK\**

“Shit!!!”

Katsuki roared before Kyouka could hit him again, explosions popping out from his closed fists and through the snares that were Kyouka’s jacks. With them right next to her jacks, Kyouka winced from the sudden noise. Katsuki took the opportunity to overpower her hold on her, his jack-covered fist rocketing into Kyouka’s cheek, knocking her to the side. 

“That is it!!! I’m fucking done!!!” Katsuki quicked rolled over towards her, his finally free palm slamming down onto Kyouka’s back, an explosion firing her straight back down into the concrete. “I took it way too easy on you! But, clearly you can handle it!”

He kicked her side, then swung his hand down low to blast her further. Kyouka was thrown back, her body skipping across the rooftop like a stone on a lake, until she went right over the edge. 

Before she could even begin to fall, Katsuki flew over her in a streak of light, his clusters of light forming around his hand as he blasted Kyouka down into the pavement below. 

Kyouka coughed as she rolled to a stop, trying to quickly get back up, but Katsuki launched himself down to the street below, his palm striking the ground. Kyouka's vision was overtaken with light as the entire street was consumed.

***\*BOOOOOM!!!\****

The ground shook and cracked, windows shattered, and bright orange took over the entire city street as the explosion and smoke took up every ounce of space it could. 

Kyouka rocketed back down the road, her shoulder being the first part of her body to make contact with the ground again, sliding across the street with a blazing trail of cinders following her body. 

She finally stopped, coughing up smoke as her eyes readjusted. She tried to blink away the sparkles in her vision, getting up on all fours as she watched blood drip down onto the pavement. 

She looked back over at ground zero, seeing Katsuki walk out of the pillar of smoke. His cheekbone was basically black from the bruising, with blood trailing from his nose and mouth. She tried to stand back up, but Katsuki was quick to the punch.

Or kick, rather. He shot himself down the road, his foot finding her ribs again.

"What was that about kicking my ass?!" Katsuki blasted Kyouka further back, her body rolling across the concrete. "I'll give it to you. You did a decent number on me. However, I might be falling behind Deku, but I sure as hell won't fall behind you!" Kyouka's jack shot out, but Katsuki grabbed it, blasting Kyouka back again. She tumbled, her body facing away from Katsuki. "That bastard has been hiding something, and he's tricked me. I know it. All this time...he was looking down on me, waiting for his moment...and now he's doing the same here."

As Kyouka tried to raise her body up, her eyes widened at that statement. "He's...looked down...on *you* ?"

"Always trying to get in my way, thinking I needed help...I don't need help, especially not from that worthles-..." Katsuki paused, then growled, "...Worthless...Or so I thought. I *thought* he was looking down, hiding this quirk. But I know he hasn't always had it. That nerd has always constantly gone on and on about quirks, he would never hide his own. He hasn't been using it to spite me...He's not the type. I know something happened, something gave him this power. And then you show up, take his place when I asked him to be here. You're here trying to defend him, cause you love him or something. Really it's probably because he's a terrible liar."

...Kyouka couldn't lie. It was both.

"But, that means you know what it is. And if I can't fight Deku, see just what he's become...then you've just wasted my time."

"Wasting."

Katsuki raised a brow, "What?"

"Wasting. Presently." Kyouka propped herself up on one knee, her back still to Katsuki as she stared at the ground. "This fight's not over, because you've pissed me off to no end. You're so blind...you don't even see just how much you've made Izuku suffer over the years. There I was, ready to clean the mess you made and not say a damn word to you, because Izuku doesn't want any more conflict. He just wants to move on, surpass you on his own...Now, I love Izuku more than anything in the world...but he isn't here right now. *I am* . And I won't lose to a narcissistic, loudmouth, abusive, son of a bitch who can't see past his own superiority complex enough to see he's not a hero."

Katsuki had heard all those insults from her before, but that last one? Not a hero? "Tch, the fuck did you-"

"I'm not the only one with good ears, dumbass. You heard me. You're not a hero. You're a bully, who couldn’t care less about the lives he saves. You don't *deserve* to be here,  and you never did, because you're not a hero. Never gonna be."

"Shut. Up."

"You're not a hero."

"Shut up!"

"You're not a hero!"

"SHUT YOUR DAMN MOUTH!!!" Katsuki blasted forward, his hand reaching out to grab Kyouka.

She didn’t mean to. Really, she didn’t. But, her rage, the fight…she just got caught up in it all. Her world slowed, her body sparking. Katsuki's eyes went wide as Kyouka swiveled around, standing up straight with her jacks pointed towards him.

***\*SCCCCKRRRRRIIIIIIEEEEEE!!!\****

Katsuki fell backwards, his fingers plugging his ears as a piercing screech blasted throughout the facility. The ground shook, his body stuttering from the vibrations. Every window on the street shattered, along with the lights at the high ceiling, glass flying everywhere but soon eroding away into a fine powder. 

The sound soon stopped, everything returning to normal. Katsuki opened his eyes, unplugging his ringing ears. His whole body was shaking, unable to stop himself from vibrating, and it almost felt like he was having a heart attack. He looked up, his eyes widening at the sight. Kyouka stood tall, her jacks were bruised, slightly dripping with blood. 

"Y-...You...H-How...How…How the hell did you do that?!"

"Wouldn't you like to know." Kyouka crouched down, getting ready to attack again. 

Katsuki growled, standing up and getting ready to fight. He didn't know what the hell was going on. He decided to forgo his main reasoning for being there, and shifted his attention to something else.

He was being challenged, and he wouldn't back down. 

Kyouka furrowed her brow, knowing she was letting her anger control her…

But, for the moment, she didn't give a damn.

“ENOUGH!” Both fighters jumped in surprise, looking down the road to see Izuku appear in a streak of cyan light. He skidded to a halt, looking back and forth between them, “What the hell is going on?!”

“He started it!” / “She started it!” Kyouka and Katsuki pointed at each other.

“Just hold on, I-...” Izuku suddenly fell silent, his mind seemingly finally processing Kyouka’s appearance. He slowly walked up to her, taking in every scratch, every bruise, every burn, the blood running down her face. 

She watched Izuku’s face go through dozens of different emotions in only a few seconds as he scanned her body. He slowly reached up, putting his hand on her cheek.

“You hit her…”

…Uh-oh.

Kyouka’s heart dropped as she realized what was happening. His voice was quiet, monotone, more of an afterthought than anything. She had been hit before, it was part of the job. 

This, though? If she had been fighting anyone else, Izuku would still be livid, but he was fully aware she was capable of fighting her own battles. He didn’t need to defend her.

But, Katsuki…

This was the angriest she had ever seen Izuku, yet most would be confused by that statement. From an outside perspective, Izuku looked almost emotionless. But, she was fairly confident in saying she probably knew Izuku better than anyone. She had gazed into his eyes more than enough to classify them as her personal windows into his soul. 

This was different…

He was staring blankly, because his body didn’t know how to react to the sheer amount of blistering rage he was experiencing. Izuku had been angry before. He had been full of rage, he had snapped on those very few occasions where his bottled-up emotions overflowed for just quick bursts. She had seen them all. 

It was as if he had gone into shock, not knowing he was capable of experiencing such fury. 

She didn’t know how, but she could feel it. She felt this boiling heat wash over her, and she knew it wasn’t her anger. It was Izuku’s.

“I told her I didn’t wanna fight her! I was after you! But, she just *had* to defend you. You couldn’t just show up your fucking self. You just *had* to send her, didn’t you? I ain’t worth your fuckin’ time?! Huh?! Worst part…worst part is…” Katsuki growled, spitting more blood onto the ground. He stared at the deep red, shaking his head in disgust. “She actually put up a good fight. All this time, trying to keep up with you…I can’t even put down your weak-ass girlfriend. What kinda sick fucking joke is that? Here I was, thinking I could fight the guy who got his quirk from All Might…”

Izuku slowly turned his gaze towards Katsuki, but the intensity in his eyes told Kyouka that he wasn’t turning in shock at the reveal. She honestly didn’t think Izuku even heard him. 

She put his hand on his arm, trying to pull him back to reality, “Izuku…”

He wasn’t moving, his mind was completely honed in on Katsuki. The smell of smoke and singed hair wasn't unknown to Izuku. It made him want to vomit. 

The bruises…

The burns…

The cuts and blood…

The god awful ringing in his ears…

 But, it wasn't on him this time. It was Kyouka.

His blood began to boil. His heart began pounding in his ears, and an intense heat began shooting through his veins as he felt power course through his muscles. His breathing became uneven as he began to shake.

In Izuku's mind, everything went red. Katsuki was no longer wearing the outfit he was actually wearing. Instead, in Izuku’s head, he was wearing his old middle school uniform with the same smug smile and malicious glare in his eye. 

The person he used to look up to. The person he used to play Heroes with. The person who he used to think was his friend, at least at one point in time. The person who turned into his tormentor. The person that used to beat him up. The person that turned everyone against him. The person that made him feel like a waste of life. The person that hurt Kyouka.

Kyouka was right, it would all boil over eventually. Today was apparently that day. 

 *~"You worthless piece of quirkless trash."~* 

*~"Yeah! Get him Bakugou!"~*

*~"You think you can be a hero? You think you can get in my way?"~*

*~"Fucking loser."~*

*~"Give up, freak!"~*

*~"Don't touch me! I might catch your quirklessness."~*

*~"Take a swan dive off of the roof of the building…"~*

  
  

“Yeah, that’s right. I know,” Katsuki wheezed out a chuckle, but there was no real humor in his laugh. It seemed more strained and sad, than anything. “That’s why I wanted to fight you. I wanted to see what he saw in you. If my way of looking at things was wrong, and All Might…He chose you. You were the one he saw, who he recognized, made stronger…And I-...” They watched him clench his eyes shut to stave off tears, grabbing tufts of his hair tightly, his voice cracking as he continued. “I was the one who ended him. I wasn’t strong enough, and I got kidnapped by those pieces of shit. He wouldn’t have gotten into that fight, if not for me. And, then who’s the one who comes and saves me? You! *Fucking! You!* I-...I just don’t understan-”

***\*CRACK!!!\****

In the blink of an eye and a flash of cyan light, Izuku crossed the distance between them and slammed his fist directly into Katsuki’s face. His head was rocked back as blood spurted from his nose, which broke instantly with a sickening crack that echoed across the street. 

He shot like a bullet down the road, his body eventually hitting the ground and tumbling across the asphalt until he skidded to a stop with a small cloud of dust kicking up with him. 

Katsuki coughed wildly, his entire face aching as he struggled to get back up. Blood poured out of his nose, staining the ground. “Ug-...What the fuc-?”

Katsuki was suddenly grabbed by the hair, his head yanked back, Izuku looming over him. “You. Hit. Her.” 

…Well, this was what he was after the entire time. Might as well take the opportunity.

“Fuckin’ *finally!”* Katsuki cackled, his hands blasting the ground beneath them to launch him up into the sky.

…Except that didn’t happen. 

Izuku didn’t even flinch at the sudden combustion below him. He grabbed Katsuki by the face before he could even get a couple feet off the ground, slamming his head into the pavement as smoke and cinders billowed around them. 

Izuku was unblinking, his pupils shrunk, his irises glowing brightly as lightning crackled and zapped around his body at an alarming rate. His breathing was no longer ragged, and rather deep and focused. 

“What was it you always used to say?” Izuku asked, his voice quiet, yet so intense it sent chills down Katsuki's spine. He had never heard him talk like that before. “...Crush me like a bug?”

Izuku kept pressing Katsuki’s head down, slowly increasing the pressure. One foot was on Katsuki’s right wrist, and Izuku’s free hand was holding the other down, keeping Katsuki pinned. Katsuki honestly didn’t know how to respond anymore. This wasn’t how he expected things to go.

Izuku leaned down, spitting out through grit teeth, “You have *the audacity* to cry to me? *Me?* Did the last decade even *happen* in your mind? Did the last ten minutes?”

Izuku picked Katsuki up, and threw him like a ragdoll into the same building he and Kyouka had fought in earlier. But, this time shot through the entire first floor, and slammed through the back wall, his body hitting the alley wall of the building behind it, leaving the concrete cracked as he fell down to ground. 

Kyouka rushed down the street, watching Izuku disappear inside of the building he threw Katsuki into, “Wait!! Izuku!!!” 

Izuku couldn’t hear her. He just kept going. Her words just couldn’t be processed in his head right now. The hypocrisy in her pleas wasn’t lost on her either, but she knew this wasn’t what Izuku wanted. This wasn’t *him.*  

Deep down, was it satisfying to watch Izuku finally have the full upper-hand on Katsuki? Was it undeniably gratifying to see him unleash even a fraction of the pain on Katsuki that he made him suffer through for years? 

Yes. Yes, it was. 

But, unfortunately, people weren’t wrong when they said revenge doesn’t actually make you feel much better. 

It was all overshadowed by the pain of seeing Izuku this way.

This wasn’t gratifying for him. This was everything he didn’t want to be. He had told her multiple times how much he hated this part of him that he had buried deep down for so long. She couldn’t help but feel at least partially responsible, and that almost felt worse. 

She could’ve tried harder with Katsuki. She didn’t have to attack back. He just pissed her off so damn much. She *wanted* to fight him.

Now, look what it got her…

Katsuki coughed, blood dripping to the ground as he wobbly tried to get on his feet, “This…This wasn-...Hah…This isn’t about our fucking past. Aldera…all that crap was-”

“What? A long time ago?” Izuku cut him off, broken drywall and glass crunching under his feet as he stalked his way closer. Katsuki could barely see his figure in the dark room as Izuku walked through the building, but his eyes glowed brightly against the shadows. “That’s all you have to say about it? You think it can just be brushed to the side? Forgotten? Like you wanted to do with me? That is, when you weren’t berating me, beating me, both at the same time, on and on and on. Well, it can’t. Believe me, I tried. You don’t even realize what you’ve done! What you did to me! The thoughts you made me think!” Izuku threw another wide haymaker, but even a punch that wide was near impossible to stop at the speed he was going. He hit Katsuki straight on the jaw, blood spewing from the blonde’s mouth. With every shouted sentence, Izuku landed blow after blow to Katsuki’s body. “The things you almost made me do! All those years *alone!* In pain!”

Katsuki stumbled to the side, barely catching himself on his hands and knees. He was just tired from his fight with Earlobes. That’s all this was. That was definitely the answer for this, and not just a coping rationalization and way to distract himself from the things Deku was saying. 

“GRAAAH!!!” He swiveled around, his hand shooting out towards Izuku. Katsuki unleashed everything he could directly into Izuku’s chest, the explosion taking up the entire alley, the smoke spilling out of either side and onto the streets. 

The smoke cleared, Izuku’s outline taking form in the dissipating, dark clouds. His expression had remained unchanged, and his body hadn’t moved an inch. Seemingly, the only thing Katsuki did was leave a scorch mark on his t-shirt. 

“...Fuck.”

Izuku uppercut Katsuki, the blonde’s body moving through the concrete like a ship on water until he reached the top of the building, his body continuing to go up into the air. Before Katsuki could stop his ascent or redirect himself with his quirk, he was tackled by a streak of cyan light, taking him even further into the air. 

Their bodies spun together in a cyclone of crackling lightning and booming explosions as they reached the peak that their momentum could take them. Izuku smacked Katsuki’s hand to the side, the explosion knocking them both to the side, careening towards another skyscraper.

Izuku’s legs began to glow brightly as he focused excess power into them, placing both feet on Katsuki’s chest and kicking him down, lightning coursing through his body. 

Katsuki went through the window, his body skipping through the office space on the inside, all the way to the windows on the other side. He aimed his hands towards the ground, using smaller explosions to slow his fall. 

He was somewhat successful, managing to land onto the rooftop of a parking garage, his legs giving out once he felt concrete beneath him. He panted as he wiped blood out of his eye, a cut on his forehead bleeding at what was probably an alarming rate. He could practically feel his bones rattling, the shockwaves from Izuku’s hits still panging throughout his body. 

Something had to be broken, he just couldn’t tell what. He could discern where it hurt the most. Even if he had the time to think of something to say, what could he even say that would stop this? 

He wanted a fight, but not like this. 

This was supposed to be about Deku’s fucking powers, not about their stupid past. Things were going just fine when neither acknowledged it, but Earlobes just had to constantly bring it back up. He never thought it would come back to bite him, mostly because he never thought he had done anything wrong. 

Or, rather he had deluded himself enough. 

Deep down, he knew this was karma coming back in full force.

He heard the familiar crackles of Izuku’s energy, looking up and seeing Izuku jump off the roof of the skyscraper he had been kicked through. Izuku’s entire body glowed a pure, bright cyan, taking over all of his features. Power shot out behind him in a shockwave, firing his body down at Katsuki like a bullet.

…No, *that* was karma.

Katsuki quickly blasted himself out of the way, just barely dodging Izuku slamming directly into the spot where he was, going straight through the concrete and through the parking garage, gray dust and debris shooting everywhere as Katsuki was thrown back. 

At this point, Izuku had probably done more damage to himself than Katsuki had done to him.

“That must’ve been everything you’ve always wanted…” Izuku’s voice echoed from the hole he had created, talking from inside the garage. “Watching me jump off a building.”

Katsuki groaned, “You keep a record of all my fuckin’ quotes? Look, that…I didn’t me-”

***\*CRASH\**** 

Izuku’s hand suddenly burst through the concrete, grabbing Katsuki’s ankle and dragging him down with him. He slammed Katsuki against the ground, pieces of rubble falling around them. “You what? You didn’t mean it? Well, isn’t that just so nice to know? But, don’t feel too bad about it. If you even know what guilt feels like, that is. I had the idea long before you suggested it.”

Katsuki froze in his attempt to get back up, his eyes going wide. He looked up at Izuku, not sure if he was joking or not. His voice was still monotone, yet dripping with malice. “Wh-...Wh-?”

“Don’t play dumb,” Izuku cut Katsuki off and stepped down on his chest, pinning him. “You’re not stupid, Kacchan. Even if you were so delusional that you didn’t know, you heard what Shigaraki said about me on the Aldera roof. You know, I used to think that maybe if I had done it, you would’ve finally learned. Maybe you finally could’ve seen what you had done, the effect you had on me. Maybe, you could’ve changed.”

“I-...I-I-...” 

“Who the hell am I kidding?” Izuku swung his leg back, kicking Katsuki straight in the chin and sending skidding down the garage, past all of the parking spots until he hit the concrete barrier. Katsuki coughed as he grabbed the barrier, trying to pull himself up. Izuku was on him instantly, gripping the collar of his shirt and pushing him against the concrete, the night air blowing in their hair. “You would've been relieved, finally rid of me. Two people in this world would’ve missed me, or even known I existed. My body could’ve been lying in front of the school, and everyone would’ve walked right over me. You wouldn't even take the time to laugh at my corpse.”

  
  
  

***~...AMP…~***

  
  

Kyouka’s hand was frozen on the doorknob, her jacks perked as she listened to the conversation happening on the other side. She had been trying to keep up with the two, but it was extremely difficult while trying to hide her powers from Katsuki. 

Thankfully, they had been taken out of sight, and she was able to rush into the parking garage she saw them land in. 

…She almost wished she hadn’t.

She had caught onto the tail of the conversation. It was unfortunate how much it didn’t surprise it, and yet it still felt just as horrid. 

Bakugou telling someone to kill themselves? Every single day he found a new way to make her hate him more, but that just seemed par for the course at this point. 

She wasn’t blind. She wasn’t stupid. She heard his stories. She knew what life was like for him before they met. She knew he hadn’t told her everything, he had basically admitted it on the train back from Kamino, and she was fully aware it was likely the darker stuff he kept to himself.

She just ignored it, never wanting to admit it. Or, honestly, she wasn’t sure she could handle it.

The mere idea that Izuku was…

She couldn’t even think it, much less say it out loud. The word was clawing and gnawing at the back of her mind, screaming to be let in, but she wouldn’t let it. 

Kyouka thought she was gonna vomit. The person she loved, brought to that. She wanted to stop this, stop Izuku and take him as far away from Katsuki as possible. 

But, his goal was simple now: Hurt Bakugou. He was doing it physically, and his admission was his attempt at doing it psychologically. Izuku’s patience and tolerance was unmatched, but Katsuki had finally done it. He finally made Izuku snap, and this was the cost. 

At this point, she wasn’t sure if she wanted to stop Izuku anymore. 

…She just wanted Bakugou to hurt.

So, against her better judgement, she let go of the doorknob. 

  
  
  

***~...AMP…~***

  
  

“You’re fuckin’ lying…” 

Izuku’s pupils shrunk, his eye twitching, “...What?”

“You’re just trying to fuck with me, acting like you got it so bad. All Might’s little favorite…”

“...You just don’t stop. You…You’re *hopeless.* ” Izuku’s scowl deepened, slamming his forehead into Katsuki’s nose. He kicked hard, sending Katsuki through the barrier and into the air. He once again used his energy to shoot himself off like a bullet, colliding into Katsuki. They flew across the streets below, with Izuku grabbing Katsuki by the neck and slamming him down as they landed on another rooftop. They slid across the gravel, stopping with Katsuki’s head just barely reaching the edge. “Even now you keep trying to delude yourself, but you don’t even believe it. So *God-damn blind!* Open your eyes!!!”

He spun him around and grabbed the back of Katsuki’s neck, forcing him to look down at the streets below, “The fuck are you doi-?!”

“Shut up!!!” Izuku shoved him down, Katsuki’s chest against the concrete. “This is what you could’ve done to me!”

Izuku let him go, but Katsuki didn’t move. He continued to stare down at the streets below, the idea of Izuku’s broken body laying down on the streets, blood slowly pooling around him, lifeless eyes staring right back at him.

…Who the fuck was he kidding anymore?

He knew it. There wasn't a doubt in Katsuki's mind since the moment Izuku had said it. There were always the days where back at middle school, Izuku was...vacant. He would walk into class with a sort of dead look in his eyes. 

He didn't talk, even though that was normal back at Aldera. He didn't write in his journals. He didn't run. He didn't fight back, or more appropriately he didn't try to block hits. When he would cry, it wasn't his usual over the top tears. They were silent and slow and he never wiped them away. It was almost like he didn't care.

Katsuki's stomach churned when he thought about how frequent those days became year after year.  

What happened? As much as Katsuki wanted to blame it on a million other things, he knew the real answer. *He* happened. He couldn't even blame it entirely on his quirk. Katsuki knew that he must have always been fucked up in the head. He couldn't blame how rough his mother was at times either. She was always...feisty. But, most of what she did was a response to how her son was becoming, and how he seemingly couldn’t be changed.

Heroes were meant to inspire like All Might did to him. They helped the innocent by beating the hell out of villains and never losing. Villains were the bad guys who did their best to destroy the lives of the innocent.

Innocent... 

Katsuki finally tore his gaze away from the drop below, looking back at his opponent standing over him. Izuku suddenly turned into his four-year-old self. He was the very definition of innocent. And, Katsuki wasn't looking too heroic now.

*~"Do you think we can be heroes together, Kacchan?"~*

*~"Pfft, I guess. But, you'll never be as good as me. You can be my sidekick or something."~*

 ...Some hero that kid turned out to be.

Young Izuku turned back into Izuku now. His face formed into an intense glare. His brow furrowed and his fists clenched. Lightning still flowed from his eyes and the vibrant scars of red power etched across his body. He turned that innocent kid…into that.

…The fuck had he done?

“I’ve never told anyone this. Not a soul, not even Kyouka. But…You know what? I don’t even care right now. It’s just another piece of my life you’ve had control over. I don’t even know what I’m doing or saying anymore. Maybe, deep down, I’m hoping some of this might actually mean something to you…” Izuku shook his head, the short break in his temporary insanity over as he returned his glare back to Katsuki. “...But, I’m done holding my breath. You’ll never know what it’s like to be hated, to be broken. You’ll never know what it’s like to sometimes wish you could just disappear…You know what the real sad part is? I never actually tried. I had clung onto my own delusions so hard, so desperately, that I never even considered actually going through with it…Let’s fix that.”

Katsuki’s eyes widened, “Wh-?!”

In a flash of light, Izuku grappled Katsuki’s neck, wrestling him to the ground in an instant, “You and me…we’re taking a swan dive.”

Izuku powered up, and leaped backwards off of the building, taking Katsuki with him. Katsuki growled, putting his hand out to blast them in a different direction, but Izuku took his hand and held it steady. With the level of power Izuku was exhibiting now, there was no resisting. 

Izuku craned his neck around and flung them around as a burst of power from his back combined with the explosions from Katsuki, shooting them down faster. 

They crash-landed, an explosion rocking the street. Windows shattered and light poles rattled as the pavement cracked apart. The explosion emanated across the city street, pouring out over the rooftops above. The light faded as fast as it was made, the smoke clearing away into the open air.

Katsuki laid face down on the rough asphalt, broken and beaten being an understatement. There wasn’t a single spot on his body that wasn’t in pain, he tasted and smelled copper, and he could barely breathe through his nose. Scratches and bruises covered his body, his ribs either knocked out of place or simply just broken. 

His body could take super-powered beatings, but Izuku had put that concept to shame.

He turned his head, finding Izuku next to him. He was on his hands and knees, his eyes clenched shut as tears finally began to peek out, his lips beginning to quiver. He didn’t sob, he didn’t make any noise whatsoever. 

Katsuki heard footsteps, but he was too tired to turn his head any more. Kyouka’s shoes came into his vision, stopping next to Izuku. She fell to her knees, putting her arms around his neck.

Izuku instantly collapsed into her. Her hand threaded through Izuku’s curls as she nuzzled into his neck, her own tears beginning to flow freely. 

For the first time, Katsuki was actually grateful for Kyouka. 

“Jesus Christ…” 

Katsuki’s heart stopped as he recognized the voice. He managed to slightly push himself up, looking down the road.

All Might…

Toshinori stood shellshocked, unable to process what he was looking at. His eyes slowly scanned the destruction all around him, the physically broken mess of Katsuki, and the mentally broken mess of his proteges. 

He couldn’t even park his truck before seeing the explosions off in the distance. The rest of the UA staff were still off campus, the “assassination attempt” causing them to stay behind in Tokyo for longer than anticipated. 

All clues of the current situation, along with all of the context clues he had of Izuku’s past with Young Bakugou, he at least had some sort of picture of what might’ve gone down. 

And, it was probably best to settle this privately, and with much cooler heads.

Toshinori wanted to go to the couple first, but clearly Katsuki was the one in need of immediate attention. He quickly got to him, reaching down to help him up, “You two, wait for me in the common room. I hope all three of you have good explanations for Aizawa. Young Bakugou, are you ok? Stupid question, I know. C’mon, let’s get you to Recovery Gir-”

Katsuki shrugged Toshinori’s hand off of him, “Just…Just worry about them.”

“Now’s not the time to be prideful, young man. C’mon, just-”

“Leave me alone,” Katsuki sighed out, grunting in pain as he pushed himself up onto his knees. “...Please. My legs ain’t broken, I’ll walk. Just…Help him.”

Toshinori furrowed his brow, never seeing Katsuki act in such a way. Outside of the boy being irreparably stubborn, that is. He relented for the moment, but he’d personally escort him to Recovery Girl. 

“Are you okay to go back to the dorms?” Toshinori asked the couple, speaking softly. Izuku didn’t respond, but Kyouka nodded. She whispered something in Izuku’s ear, slowly moving out of his embrace. “Up you go, my boy. We’ll speak later.”

Izuku panted heavily, looking up at All Might’s extended hand. But, before he took it, he looked back at Katsuki. Covering his body were scratches and bruises that could be seen through his torn clothes. Even with one eye black and swollen, and the other with blood from the cut on his forehead dripping down onto it, Katsuki’s piercing red eyes could be seen looking right at him. 

“...Touch Kyouka again… *and I’ll fucking kill you.”*

Toshinori opened his mouth, but quickly closed it. He couldn’t exactly reprimand Izuku for saying that, not after all…this. In his situation, he would’ve said the same thing. It was just so out-of-character for him.

The mere fact that Young Izuku of all people was driven to say that meant he was truly sent over the edge. 

Izuku helped Kyouka to her feet first, taking her hand with his other hand on her back. While she tried to assure him that he was fine, Toshinori walked back over to Katsuki. He leaned down, hand extended, “Let’s get you up.”

“I told you to lea-”

“Could just leave you here to bleed out and die,” Kyouka snapped at him. 

“Young Jirou…” Toshinori warned her before looking back at Katsuki. “Take my hand, young man. 

Katsuki stared at Toshinori’s hand, almost about to take it. But, he eventually spit more blood on the ground, grunting as he stood up on his own. He stumbled as he got to his feet, but remained upright, holding his side as he began to limp down the road.

Toshinori sighed, following his students down the road and back towards the main entrance. The walk was just as silent and tense as he expected. He looked around at the destruction they had caused as they passed each building by. 

It was far beyond a scrap. They went all out. 

Based on how Izuku didn’t seem to have a single injury, he must’ve come in later. Kyouka looked bad, but Katsuki clearly got the worst of it. He could make a good guess why…

They reached the front gate, hitting the main pathways of campus. Toshinori was really hoping to get them all taken care of before Aizawa got back, leaving everything for the morning.

…Unfortunately, the universe had other plans.

“What *the hell* am I looking at?!” Toshinori cringed as he saw Aizawa marching down towards them, his suit from the gala still on, his undone tie hanging loosely around his neck. Shouta held up his phone as he glared at his students, “I got a notification from one of the security drones that there was an emergency in the testing zone. You know, a part of me knew you two would be involved. But, against my better judgement, I thought, ‘No, of course not. Not on the night they got their license.’ Lo and behold. What exactly-?!”

“Not tonight…” Toshinori quickly pulled Aizawa aside, his voice low. “Trust me, just…Not now. Believe me, you’re not gonna get anything outta any of them. Young Bakugou needs medical attention before any sort of shakedown anyway. Just-”

“I started it.” Everyone turned at Katsuki’s confession, except for Izuku, who remained staring emotionless at nothing. “I asked De-...Midoriya to come out there and fight me. Jirou showed up instead, and told me to leave them alone. I was angry, and attacked first. Midoriya showed up, and you can figure out the rest from there.”

“I don’t want your help,” Kyouka side-eyed him before turning back to Aizawa. “He attacked first, yeah. But, it was to get me out of the way. He didn’t wanna fight me. I punched him, and antagonized him to fight me.” 

Shouta sighed, rubbing at his temple, “And, why exactly would you do that?”

“Because fuck him.”

“Okay,” Shouta put his hand up with a sigh, hearing enough. “Just…Midoriya, come with me. Bakugou, Jirou, go with All Might to Recovery Girl’s office an-”

“No,” Kyokua shook her head, dead-serious look in her eyes, “I’m not going anywhere with him. I’ll see her tomorrow.”

“That wasn’t a suggesti-”

“I’m tougher than I look,” Kyouka cut him off. “We don’t need the third-degree right now. We fought. End of discussion. The inner-workings of it aren’t your business until we decide you should be privy to it.”

Aizawa blinked a couple times in shock, never having a student talk like that to him before. His brow furrowed, his eyes widening in anger as he stepped forward, *“Excuse me?”*

“You’re excused. Now, drop it.”

“Young Jirou,” Toshinori side-eyed her before moving in front of Aizawa, whispering to him, *“I told you. Not tonight. I don’t fully know what went on in there, but believe me when I say this goes back further than either of us are ready to handle. You know them, they’re not gonna talk. You also know that she would never speak that way to you, unless she was completely serious. Just let it go. For tonight, I mean.”*

Aizawa pressed his tongue against the back of his bottom teeth, looking off into the distance as he tried to process it all. He turned away from his students, looking up at Toshinori, and whispering back, *“I said before that our situation doesn’t mean I’m gonna give them any leeway.”*

*“This isn’t about that. This has nothing to do with that, or UA, or you and me. Which means, I’m not asking you to take it easy on them as a coworker. I’m asking as a friend and confidant. Those three aren’t distressed, they’re broken. Punishment for the fight? Of course. But, what it was about? It…Hell, Aizawa. You’re a smart man. Put some context clues together.”*

  Aizawa clicked his teeth together, clenching his eyes shut as sighed, turning back to his students, “You two, go back to your dorms. You’re not to leave until called for. Unless you’re dying, I’m not to see your faces. We’re calling both of your parents in the morning. Understood?”

They didn’t respond. Kyouka just put her arm on Izuku’s back, moving past Aizawa and heading for the dorms. 

He shook his head, turning to Katsuki and nodding his head down the other pathway, “Go to Recovery Girl. You better have a *damn* good explanation tomorrow, or prepare to pack your bags.”

He turned away, heading back towards the teacher’s apartments, his fists clenched. Toshinori sighed in relief, looking down at Katsuki, “Don’t worry, he’s tired, confused, and angry. Everyone will have more level heads in the morning. He won’t expel you.”

“...Yeah?” Katsuki’s voice was low, monotone. His face, expressionless. He held his side, limping his way down the path. “Why the hell not?”

  
  
  

***~...AMP…~***

  
  
  

**(** **Ten Minutes Later: AMP’s Dorm** **)**

  
  

They made it back, closing the door behind them. Aizawa might’ve made it sound like a punishment, but there was nowhere else in the world where they wanted to be right now. 

Kyouka’s first stop was the bathroom, walking in and starting the water, the streams hitting the ceramic and steam already rising. She walked back into the bedroom, making her way to Izuku. He sat on the bed, his gaze locked onto the blood spatter on his knuckles. 

She reached down, took his hand, and gently pulled him to his feet. She led him into the bathroom, shutting the door behind them. 

She looked down at him, sighing as she realized every speck of blood on him wasn’t his own. Kyouka grabbed the hem of his shirt, her jacks unbuckling his belt. 

“C’mon, let’s clean up.” Izuku raised his hand up, lightly touching her cheek. His eyes analyzed her face, taking all of her injuries again. Kyouka wiped away some dried-up blood under her nose, giving him a half-hearted smirk, “Am I still pretty like this?”

He gave a half-hearted laugh, really only coming out as a hum. Izuku held their foreheads together, his arms snaking around Kyouka’s back. She sighed, cupping his face, standing together in silence.

Eventually, she felt Izuku lean to the side, opening up the cabinet under the sink. He moved out of her hold, leaning down and taking out the complimentary first-aid kits that came with each dorm room. He then opened up the taller cabinet next to the sink, taking out a couple of rags. 

He grabbed the bottom of Kyouka’s polo shirt, helping her take it off. Once it was on the floor, he found a large bruise on her side. He gently put his hand over it, a scowl returning to his lips. 

Kyouka quickly put her hand over his, her jack going under his chin to guide his gaze back to hers, “It’s like I said, you all know I’m tougher than I look. Unfortunately, I had to hide the fact that I could pulverize him.” 

Izuku finally gave a legitimate laugh, chuckling tiredly. They finished undressing, throwing their clothes in the hamper, the smell of smoke finally dissipating once the lid was closed. 

They stepped into the shower, blood and soot instantly streaming down the drain once the hot water hit them. Izuku wet one of the rags, very gently going over the cut near Kyouka’s hairline. 

“...You don’t have to tell me, you know? However long you need, I wo-”

“It’s far past time,” Izuku shook his head, his voice quiet. “I should’ve told you a long time ago.”

“That’s a super sensitive topic, Izuku. It’s completely understandable that-”

“It’s not as serious as you think.”

Kyouka deadpanned up at him as he began wiping away the blood under her nose, “...Izuku.”

“You had to have heard what I said. I never actually tried.”

“But, you considered it.”

“I *thought* about it. Big difference.”

“Not a big enough difference to where you’re still categorized as having suicidal thoughts.” 

Kyouka seemingly locked up. There it was, that word. The word she had avoided both saying and thinking. It just slipped out. Every image in her mind that she had been blocking out suddenly came flooding through.

Izuku, bloody and broken on the pavement, thinking his entire life was hopeless, and felt he was hated by the world.

Kyouka bit the inside of her cheek, feeling her eyes begin to sting. “I-...I’m sorry. It’s not about me, I shouldn’t be-”

Izuku shook her head, bringing her into his embrace, resting his cheek on her head. “It may sound odd, but hearing you react this way is kinda comforting. All those years, thinking nobody but my mom would ever care…I don’t know, I-”

“I get it,” Kyouka nodded against his chest. “Just…Just take all the time you need. That’s all I wanted to say.”

“We’d be up all night, I-...” Izuku furrowed his brow, an idea dawning on him. He leaned back, Kyouka meeting his gaze. “...Let me show you.”
