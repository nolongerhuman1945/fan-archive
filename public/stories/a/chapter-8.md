# Chapter 8

New Mexico's desert looked the same in 2012 as it had in 1967, when Aris had last passed through—endless scrub, red rock formations, sky so big it made humans feel appropriately small. The rental car's air conditioning fought a losing battle against October heat that had no business existing this late in the year.

The energy signature he'd been tracking led to a crater thirty miles outside of Roswell. Not the famous one from 1947, but something newer. Recent. The ground showed scorch marks in perfect radial patterns, and at the center, surrounded by SHIELD equipment and looking thoroughly confused, stood Phil Coulson.

Aris parked half a mile out and approached on foot. Gave Coulson time to notice him, time to prepare whatever defensive response came naturally. But the agent just waved, friendly, like they'd arranged to meet for lunch.

"You're not SHIELD," Coulson called out. "At least, not officially."

"Contractor. Aris Kaine." He stopped at the crater's edge, studying the patterns. Electromagnetic discharge, definitely. Something with significant power had hit here. "What happened?"

"Wish I knew. Local rancher reported lights in the sky, came out to investigate, found this." Coulson gestured at the crater with the tablet he'd been using to take readings. "Energy signature matches the New York incident but wrong frequency. Whatever made this, it wasn't Chitauri."

"Could be natural phenomenon. Lightning strike, maybe."

"Lightning doesn't create geometric patterns." Coulson zoomed in on his tablet, showing detailed scans. "Someone or something deliberately channeled energy into the ground. The question is why."

Aris extended his senses carefully, mapping the residual electromagnetic fields. The discharge had happened maybe six hours ago, based on decay rates. And the frequency—

His chest tightened.

Subject Zero. The signature was faint but unmistakable. One of them had been here.

"You feel that?" Coulson asked suddenly.

Aris looked up sharply. "Feel what?"

"Static electricity. Makes my teeth hurt." Coulson rubbed his jaw, expression puzzled. "Been getting that a lot lately. Started after New York, actually. Doctor says it's stress-related but it doesn't feel like stress."

"What does it feel like?"

"Like..." Coulson struggled for words. "Like my body remembers something my brain doesn't. Sense memory without the context." He laughed self-consciously. "I know that sounds crazy."

It sounded like suppressed abilities trying to surface.

Aris took a calculated risk. "Mind if I take a closer look at the crater? Might be able to get different readings with my equipment."

"Be my guest. I've documented everything I can think of."

They descended together, Coulson maintaining friendly conversation about SHIELD protocols and evidence collection while Aris scanned for quantum signatures. Nothing useful—whoever had been here was long gone. But the crater itself told a story.

Someone had been practicing. Testing their limits. The discharge patterns showed increasing intensity, like a person learning to control escalating power.

Subject Four, maybe. Or Five. Someone losing stability, trying to burn off excess energy before it consumed them.

"Can I ask you something?" Aris kept his tone casual, curious rather than interrogative. "How long have you been with SHIELD?"

"Twenty-three years. Started right out of college." Coulson's smile held genuine fondness. "Best decision I ever made. Little weird sometimes, but the work matters."

"Ever encounter anything that made you question your baseline assumptions about reality?"

"You mean besides aliens invading New York?" Coulson laughed. "Yeah, constantly. Thor showed up claiming to be an actual Norse god. Stark built a functional arc reactor in a cave. Captain America got unfrozen after seventy years. At this point I've learned to accept that reality is significantly stranger than anyone admits."

"And you've never felt... different? Like you could do things other people couldn't?"

Coulson's expression shifted slightly. Not defensive, but cautious. "That's an oddly specific question."

"Sorry. Occupational hazard—I analyze people for a living. Sometimes I push too hard."

"What exactly do you analyze?"

Time to commit. Aris met Coulson's gaze directly. "Enhanced individuals. People with abilities beyond normal human parameters. I help SHIELD assess whether they're dangerous or just different."

Coulson went very still. His heartbeat accelerated—Aris felt it through bioelectric fields—but his face remained calm.

"And you think I'm enhanced," Coulson said quietly.

"I think you might be. Without knowing it."

"That's—" Coulson started to laugh, then stopped. His hand went to his temple, fingers pressing against skull like he could physically hold back a migraine. "That's not possible. I've been through medical evaluations. Standard SHIELD protocols. Someone would've noticed."

"Not if the enhancement was deliberately suppressed. Buried so deep you forgot it existed."

"Why would anyone do that?"

"Mercy. Containment. Fear." Aris took a careful step closer. "Phil, I need you to trust me for about five minutes. Can you do that?"

"Depends what happens in those five minutes."

Fair answer. Aris held up his hand, letting blue-white energy crackle between his fingers. Coulson's eyes widened but he didn't step back. Trained agent, controlling his fear response.

"I have abilities," Aris said. "Energy manipulation, quantum restructuring. I can sense things other people can't. And right now, I'm sensing something in you that shouldn't be there—a block in your neural pathways. Something artificial, keeping part of your mind locked away."

Coulson's hand dropped from his temple. His expression had gone distant, like he was listening to something only he could hear.

"I've had dreams," he said suddenly. "Since New York. Strange ones. I'm a kid again, ten or eleven, and there are people in white coats. They're doing something to me. Something that hurts." His voice wavered. "I wake up and tell myself it's just stress. Psychological response to the invasion. But it feels... real."

"It might be. Real, I mean." Aris extinguished the energy, kept his hands visible and non-threatening. "I can help you find out. Connect our minds briefly, look at those blocks. But I need your consent. If I push past your mental barriers without permission, I'm no better than whoever put them there."

Coulson was silent for a long moment, gaze fixed on the crater's geometric patterns. When he finally spoke, his voice carried the weight of someone about to step off a cliff.

"Will it hurt?"

"Probably. Memory suppression doesn't come out gently."

"Will I still be me after?"

"Yes. Just with access to everything you used to be."

Another pause. Then Coulson extended his hand. "Do it. I'm tired of feeling like half a person."

Aris took his hand and opened the connection.

The first layer of Coulson's consciousness was exactly what he'd expected—dedicated agent, loyal friend, lover of vintage Captain America trading cards. Normal, well-adjusted, slightly boring. Perfect cover.

The second layer held anxiety. Fear that he wasn't good enough, wasn't strong enough, would let people down when it mattered. Standard impostor syndrome amplified by working alongside literal superheroes.

The third layer—

The third layer screamed.

Aris found the blocks immediately. Neural pathways severed with surgical precision, memories locked behind walls built from Coulson's own bioelectric signature. Sophisticated work. Permanent, if left undisturbed.

He began dismantling them carefully, peeling back layers, giving Coulson's mind time to adjust. The first memory that surfaced was innocuous—a boy learning to make light dance between his fingers, giggling with delight.

Then came the facility. White walls, clinical smell, adults in lab coats who smiled while they hurt him. Tests. Treatments. Other children screaming in adjacent rooms.

Project Genesis, Manhattan facility, 1951.

Coulson's hand tightened on Aris's, knuckles white. His other hand came up, gripping Aris's shoulder, anchoring himself to reality as false memories crumbled and real ones surfaced.

*Subject Zero-Seven demonstrates unprecedented control over electromagnetic fields. Can manipulate devices at distance, disrupt electronic systems, theoretically interface with any powered system. Recommend advancing to Phase Three immediately.*

The boy who would become Phil Coulson, brilliant and terrified, learning to survive by pleasing his captors. By being useful. By suppressing anything that might get him discarded like the others who'd failed.

Then came the decision. The scientists arguing. Coulson's abilities were too dangerous to let loose, too valuable to terminate. Solution: suppress them completely. Give him false memories of a normal childhood. Place him in foster care and monitor from a distance.

They'd stolen his power and given him a lie.

Aris pulled back from the deepest memories, letting Coulson's mind process at its own pace. The connection between them hummed with shared understanding—two children transformed into weapons, one who remembered and one who'd forgotten.

Coulson made a sound—not quite a sob, not quite a scream. His eyes were open but unfocused, seeing two realities simultaneously.

"Easy," Aris said. "Stay with me. You're safe. You're in New Mexico. It's 2012. You're Phil Coulson, SHIELD agent, and you're remembering things they made you forget."

"I'm—" Coulson's voice cracked. "I'm not real. Phil Coulson isn't real. He's just a construct they built over—over whatever I used to be."

"No. You're both." Aris kept the physical contact, grounding. "The boy in the facility became the man you are now. The memories they gave you, the personality you developed—that's real. They just made you forget part of your history."

"Part of my—" Coulson pulled away suddenly, stumbling backward. Energy crackled around his hands, uncontrolled, responding to emotional distress. The tablet he'd been carrying shorted out with a pop of burning circuits. "Oh God. Oh God, what did they do to me?"

"Phil. Look at me." Aris kept his voice calm, authoritative. "You need to breathe. In through your nose, out through your mouth. Control the breathing first, then the power."

"I don't know how—"

"Yes, you do. You learned when you were ten. Before they suppressed it."

Coulson closed his eyes, breathing deliberately. The energy discharge weakened, flickered, stabilized into a low hum around his hands. Instinct and training rising to meet crisis.

"Good," Aris said. "That's good. You've got this."

"Do I?" Coulson opened his eyes, looking at his crackling hands with something between horror and wonder. "What am I?"

"Enhanced. Like me. Like eleven others they experimented on." Aris moved closer slowly, giving Coulson space to retreat if needed. "Someone buried your abilities so you could have a normal life. Or at least, what passes for normal in our world."

"Who? Who did this?"

"Project Genesis researchers. Government-sanctioned program, shut down in 1953. Most of the files were destroyed but some survived." Aris pulled out his phone, showed Coulson the photograph from Webb's folder. Young Phil, maybe eleven, looking directly at the camera with eyes too knowing for a child. "That's you. Subject Zero-Seven."

Coulson stared at the image for a long time. Then, quietly: "I want to see Fury."

"Understood. We can—"

"Now. I want to see Fury now." The energy around Coulson's hands intensified. "He knew, didn't he? SHIELD knew I was enhanced and they never told me."

"I don't think Fury knew. We only figured it out yesterday."

"But you came here specifically to—" Understanding dawned. "You came to unlock my memories. This wasn't an accident."

"No. It was necessary. We're trying to find the other Subjects before someone kills them. Your memories might have information we need."

"So you violated my mind for intelligence purposes." Coulson's voice had gone flat, professional. The agent reasserting control over the traumatized child. "That's SHIELD protocol, I suppose. Mission takes priority."

"Phil—"

"Agent Coulson." The correction was sharp. "I'd like to speak with Director Fury immediately. And then I'd like you to stay the hell away from me while I figure out what's real and what's fabricated in my own damn head."

Fair. Completely fair. Aris had just destroyed Coulson's entire sense of self in the name of operational necessity. The fact that it might save lives didn't make it less of a violation.

"I'll make the call," Aris said quietly. "For what it's worth, I'm sorry. You deserved better than this."

"Everyone does." Coulson turned away, looking out over the desert. Energy continued to crackle around his hands, small discharges that scarred the earth at his feet. "Make the call. Then give me space."

Aris retreated to the crater's edge and dialed Natasha.

"Status?" she asked immediately.

"Successful recovery. Coulson's abilities are active and he remembers everything. Also, he hates me now and probably wants Fury's head on a platter."

"Complications?"

"Nothing unexpected. How fast can you get extraction here?"

"Quinjet's already en route. Twenty minutes." A pause. "You okay?"

"Define okay."

"Stupid question. Never mind." Her voice softened slightly. "We'll figure this out. Get Coulson back safely and we'll deal with the fallout."

"Copy that."

He ended the call and waited, watching Coulson practice controlling his abilities. The agent had remarkable natural talent—within ten minutes he was manipulating electromagnetic fields with precision that had taken Aris years to develop. The suppressed enhancement hadn't disappeared, just gone dormant. Muscle memory kicked in as soon as the blocks came down.

The Quinjet appeared right on schedule, descending in a wash of displaced air and turbine noise. The ramp lowered and Natasha emerged, weapon holstered but visible. She took in the situation with one sweep—Coulson standing apart, energy still flickering around his hands, Aris maintaining careful distance.

"Agent Coulson," she said. "It's good to see you."

"Is it?" His tone was arctic. "Because from where I'm standing, SHIELD just violated every protocol about informed consent and cognitive manipulation."

"You're right. We did." No deflection, no justification. "And you're owed an explanation and apology. Director Fury's waiting at the Triskelion to provide both."

"What about him?" Coulson gestured at Aris without looking. "What happens to the contractor who ripped open my mind?"

"That's your call. You want him arrested, I'll put him in custody right now."

Coulson finally turned to look at Aris directly. His expression was complex—anger, betrayal, but underneath it all, something that might have been understanding.

"He was following orders," Coulson said eventually. "Like I've done a hundred times. Like I would've done if Fury had asked me to unlock someone else's suppressed memories." The energy around his hands dimmed, flickered out. "I don't like what happened. But I understand the operational justification."

"That doesn't make it right," Aris said.

"No. It doesn't." Coulson moved toward the Quinjet, stopped at the ramp. "But we don't always get to do right things in this line of work. Sometimes we do necessary things and carry the guilt afterward." He looked back, expression softening slightly. "Thank you for asking permission first. Even knowing what the answer would be."

Then he was gone, ascending into the Quinjet.

Natasha lingered. "You look like hell."

"Feel worse." Aris rubbed his face, exhaustion settling in now that adrenaline was fading. "I just destroyed that man's entire concept of self. Gave him back memories of childhood trauma and abilities he'd lived without for fifty years. All because we needed intelligence."

"You gave him truth. What he does with it is his choice."

"Easy to say when you're not the one who forced the door open."

She grabbed his arm, grip firm. "Listen to me. Coulson's memories were going to surface eventually. New York, the increased enhanced individual activity—something would've triggered them. You controlled that process. Made sure he wasn't alone when it happened."

"That supposed to make me feel better?"

"It's supposed to make you understand the difference between cruelty and necessity." She released him, softening. "Come on. Fury wants a debrief and Coulson needs familiar faces around while he processes."

The flight back took three hours. Coulson spent most of it in the Quinjet's rear section, experimenting with his abilities under Natasha's supervision. Aris heard occasional sparks of discharge, Coulson's frustrated curses, Natasha's patient instruction.

She was good at this. Better than Aris would've been. She understood trauma, understood what it meant to have your past rewritten and your agency stolen. If anyone could help Coulson navigate this revelation, it was Black Widow.

Aris dozed fitfully, dreams filled with children screaming in white rooms. He woke as they descended toward the Triskelion, Natasha's hand on his shoulder.

"We're here. You ready?"

"No. But let's go anyway."

Fury's office felt smaller with four people in it. The Director stood behind his desk, Maria Hill at his side, both wearing expressions of professional neutrality that probably took years to perfect. Coulson sat in one of the visitor chairs, back straight, hands folded. The model agent, except for the occasional spark of energy that jumped between his fingers.

"Agent Coulson," Fury began. "I've reviewed the medical reports and Kaine's debrief. I want to be clear about something—SHIELD did not know about your enhancement until yesterday. If we had, this conversation would've happened very differently."

"Would it?" Coulson's voice stayed level. "Or would SHIELD have kept me in the dark for operational advantage?"

"I don't deal in hypotheticals. I deal in what actually happened." Fury leaned forward, eye intense. "What happened is that seventy years ago, government scientists experimented on children. Created weapons and called it progress. SHIELD inherited that legacy along with all the other Cold War nightmares. Now we're trying to clean up the mess."

"By recruiting another victim to crack open my skull."

"By finding someone who understood what you'd been through. Someone who could navigate suppressed memories without causing permanent damage." Fury's gaze shifted to Aris. "Kaine volunteered. Knew it would cost him your trust. Did it anyway because the alternative was letting you destabilize without support."

Coulson processed that for a moment. "The other Subjects. How many are still alive?"

"Four confirmed, not counting you. Three more presumed dead or deep cover." Hill pulled up a holographic display showing the Genesis files. "Someone's been hunting them. Killing the unstable ones, stealing their power. Rachel Goldman was the hunter until Kaine stopped her. But we think there might be others."

"And you need my memories to find them."

"We need anything you remember about the program. Locations, researchers, other subjects you interacted with." Fury's tone gentled slightly. "I know I'm asking you to relive trauma. But those four people are running out of time."

Coulson looked at his hands, at the energy still flickering faintly around his fingers. "I'll help. On one condition."

"Name it."

"When this is over, when we've found the others—I want the choice. Keep my abilities or have them suppressed again." His voice cracked slightly. "Because right now, I don't know who I am. Don't know if Phil Coulson was real or just a cover story. And I need time to figure that out without SHIELD deciding for me."

"Deal," Fury said immediately. "You help us find the Subjects, we give you complete autonomy over your own neurochemistry. Dr. Cross will coordinate treatment options."

"Okay." Coulson straightened, professionalism sliding back into place like armor. "Okay. What do you need to know?"

They spent the next four hours extracting everything Coulson could remember. Names surfaced—other children, most of them dead. Dr. Webb, younger and less guilt-ridden. Facility layouts, experimental protocols, the day they'd decided to suppress his abilities and why.

*Subject Seven demonstrates excessive attachment to other test subjects. Emotionally compromised. Likely to experience guilt over survivor status. Suppression recommended to preserve mental stability and ensure future functionality.*

They'd buried his abilities because he'd cared too much. Because he'd mourned the children who died and that made him weak in their assessment.

"Jesus," Hill muttered. "They destroyed a child's mind because he showed empathy."

"They destroyed twelve children's minds in various ways," Aris corrected. "Coulson just got lucky enough to forget it happened."

"I'm not sure I'd call it lucky," Coulson said quietly. "Fifty years thinking I was normal, finding out I'm not—there's no good way to process that."

Around hour five, Coulson mentioned something that made everyone stop.

"There was a thirteenth subject," he said. "Unofficial. Someone they brought in after the program was supposed to shut down."

Fury leaned forward. "Webb only documented twelve."

"Because Subject Thirteen wasn't part of Genesis. Different program, different goals. They just used the same facility." Coulson's brow furrowed, accessing fragmented memories. "I only saw them once. Before the suppression. They were older than us. Late teens, maybe twenty. And their power—" He shook his head. "It made the rest of us look like children playing with matches."

"Do you remember their name?" Natasha asked.

"Designation. Not a name." Coulson closed his eyes, concentrating. "Project Resonance, Subject Alpha. They called them—"

He stopped abruptly. Energy exploded around his hands, arcing to the metal desk, shorting out Hill's tablet. Coulson gasped, eyes flying open, looking panicked.

"Easy." Aris moved without thinking, placing a hand on Coulson's shoulder. "Ground it. Let the energy flow through you instead of fighting it."

"Can't—it's too much—"

"Yes, you can. I've got you."

Aris opened his own abilities, creating a channel for Coulson's excess discharge. The energy flowed between them, cycling harmlessly until Coulson's panic subsided and control returned.

"Sorry," Coulson said after a moment. "Memory triggered an emotional response and the power followed."

"Happens to everyone at first. You're doing fine." Aris withdrew, giving Coulson space. "Subject Alpha. You remembered their designation?"

"No. Their name." Coulson met Fury's gaze. "Her name. Subject Alpha was a woman named Evelyn Cross."

The room went silent.

Hill found her voice first. "Dr. Evelyn Cross? The psychologist treating Sarah Chen?"

"Can't be the same person," Natasha said. "Cross would have to be in her eighties."

"I'm seventy-three," Aris said quietly. "Look thirty-five. Quantum manipulation affects aging in ways we don't fully understand."

Fury was already moving, pulling up Cross's personnel file. The photograph showed a woman in her sixties, gray hair, kind eyes. Same person Aris had met in the medical bay, discussing Sarah Chen's treatment.

Same person who'd had unrestricted access to every Subject Zero SHIELD had found.

"Get her," Fury ordered. "Now."

Hill was on her phone immediately, coordinating tactical teams. Natasha drew her weapon, checking the chamber with practiced efficiency.

"I'll come with you," Coulson said.

"You're not cleared for field operations," Hill countered.

"I have abilities specifically suited for this. And she knows my face—might talk to me when she wouldn't talk to armed agents." Coulson stood, energy still crackling around his fingers but controlled now. "I'm going. That's not a request."

Fury considered briefly, then nodded. "Romanoff takes point. Coulson provides enhanced support. Kaine—" He paused. "You're too valuable to risk. Stay here."

"With respect, sir, that's bullshit." Aris stood as well. "If Cross is Subject Alpha and she's been hunting the others, she's got abilities that make Rachel Goldman look underpowered. You need everyone who can function at quantum levels."

"Or we need our most powerful asset in reserve in case this goes completely sideways."

Fair point. Aris hated it, but it was fair.

"Fine. I'll coordinate from here. But the second things go wrong—"

"You'll be the first call," Fury promised. "Now go. Dr. Cross is leaving the building as we speak. You've got maybe five minutes to intercept."

They ran.

Natasha took point, moving through the Triskelion's corridors with deadly efficiency. Coulson kept pace despite his newly reactivated abilities making him slightly clumsy—too much power, not enough practice. They hit the parking garage at a dead sprint.

Aris followed their progress through building security feeds, watching tactical teams scramble to seal exits. But Cross was already in her car, pulling out of her reserved spot with unhurried precision.

"She knows," Aris said into the comm. "She's not running but she knows you're coming."

"Copy that." Natasha emerged into the garage, weapon drawn. "Dr. Cross! SHIELD! Step out of the vehicle!"

The car stopped. The door opened.

Evelyn Cross climbed out with her hands raised, expression calm. Almost peaceful.

"Hello, Natasha," she said. "I wondered how long it would take."
