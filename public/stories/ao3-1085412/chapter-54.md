Sirius settled into the comfy armchair Albus had conjured and relaxed a little in the safety of Albus's office. He took a sip of his coffee and gazed around at the War Council. It seemed like years had passed since their first meeting. Cornelius was chatting away with Amelia and Bertie across from Sirius and Albus had left the power position behind his desk to sit with them as peers. They all had come a long way in a short space of time; had forged a good working relationship to band against the return of Voldemort. It was no wonder that two of their invited guests of Moody and Snape were viewing them with open suspicion, and even Remus viewed them with an air of bewilderment. It gave Sirius a surprising amount of satisfaction.

"Perhaps we should begin." Sirius said, cutting through the chatter with quiet forcefulness. He motioned with his cup. "First on the agenda is the tournament."

Albus perked up immediately, obviously pleased that after having no clear role on the council, he had something that was mostly his to represent.

"I think we're all aware of the results of the first task," Albus began, adjusting his orange and yellow striped robes, "Harry was successful in completing the task and leads the tournament." He heaved what was for Albus a heavy sigh. "Unfortunately there was an attempt to sabotage the tournament." He motioned at Moody.

"After investigation," Moody nodded toward Bertie and Amelia, "we've established that the Horntail was drugged with a stimulant to increase its aggression, probably over a couple of days. The chain securing the Horntail was charmed to banish during Potter's task. Which leads to a number of questions." His magical eye swivelled. "Firstly, what was the goal?"

"We've concluded the likely aim was to increase the difficulty level of Harry's task." Bertie chimed in. "I believe that the ritual is at the root of it. Riddle has to ensure that Harry is in genuine fear of his life and not immured to the danger because it is a task within the tournament. The other possible motivation that has been suggested is that Riddle wants Harry to be shown as powerful so when he defeats him, no-one else will dare stand against him. Both may have played a part here."

"Either suits Tom's agenda, I fear." Albus sighed. "If Harry dies attempting a task, Voldemort could claim he defeated him that way. If he survives he is primed for the ritual, and, yes; if Harry were to die at Tom's hand after his impressive displays in the tournament, it would crush any opposition Tom might face."

"I believe that too." Cornelius piped up.

"I think we all know it." Amelia said brusquely. "He's the banner we're fighting behind. If he falls..."

"Perhaps," Sirius said mildly, "for the sake of what remains of my sanity we could all stop talking about what might happen if Harry..." his throat closed up on the word as though his body would not physically declare the possibility of Harry dying. He made a vague wave instead.

"Apologies, Sirius," said Albus kindly.

Sirius pointed at Moody. "Right, we've covered the why, but personally I'm more interested in the how."

Moody looked at him approvingly. "Trained you well, Black." He jerked his thumb in the direction of Remus. "From Remus's chat with Hagrid we know security was compromised during the period the dragons were hidden in the Forest ahead of the tournament."

Amelia shifted in her seat, looking uncomfortable. "I'm sorry to say that the Aurors on duty assisting the team from the dragon reserve were lax in their attention by allowing visitors." Her lips formed a grim line. "They have been reprimanded." She gestured. "Upon pressing them for information they were able to provide a complete list of all the visitors to the dragons in the Forest."

"Now here's where it gets interesting," Moody said with worrying enthusiasm, "apart from a host of teachers who should have known better, the Aurors noted a couple of boys from Durmstrang hanging about which corroborates Hagrid's information."

"We're also certain that the boys were the culprits as all the teachers when questioned confessed their foray to see the dragons and agreed to an identity check there and then." Amelia slid in.

Moody huffed. "Thing is we don't think these boys are boys."

"The Aurors have failed to identify them from the immigration passports of the students we have here." Amelia said.

"It's brilliant in its simplicity." Albus noted seriously. "We see the uniform, recognise that the individual is a student and we rarely think any more about them."

"Especially students you don't teach yourself." Moody made an unhappy noise. "Have to confess I'd have a hard time identifying the foreign lot beyond the two Champions."

"The question is," Remus said, "do we think Crouch Junior and company have used Durmstrang uniforms because it's expedient, or because of another reason."

"Such as getting help from their former cohort, Karkaroff." Moody growled. "I know what I think."

"I think we all know what you think, Alastor." Amelia said, some amusement creeping back into her voice. "The problem is that we don't have proof of their point of entry."

Remus frowned. "Surely we can eliminate the Forest itself. The dragons were hidden between the Centaurs and the Acromantulas. It would be madness to apparate into either territory."

"That's my view," Moody said, "however Amelia is right that we don't know for certain that's not what happened."

"Which means we don't have grounds to request a search of the Durmstrang ship or to take Karkaroff in for formal questioning." Amelia stressed.

"And not that we could demand such actions without going through proper diplomatic channels." Cornelius hastened to add.

Sirius was prepared to accept that since the Durmstrang ship was officially Bulgarian territory. Any presumptive arrogance on the part of the British government and it could take until the end of the tournament before they were allowed near it.

"I approached Igor myself," Albus said, "using the pretext of suggesting it was one of the actual Durmstrang students visiting the dragons." He shook his head, his long beard trailing. "Alas, he gave nothing away if he is involved."

Sirius glanced at Snape.

"Karkaroff and I have avoided each other." Snape bit out tersely.

Which was to be expected. They were both former Death Eaters, disgraced. Normally they would do their best to ignore the association.

Sirius turned it over in his head. Would Karkaroff be suspicious if Snape did approach him? He looked at Snape who sneered at him. Sirius ignored him.

"Wouldn't it make sense for you as a spy to try and find out if Karkaroff has heard from Voldemort?" Sirius asked pointedly. "You are supposed to be playing for his side as far as he's concerned."

Snape stiffened. "If you are inferring for one second that my loyalty is in question..."

Sirius cut him off with an impatient gesture. "Don't be stupid, Snape. I know where your loyalty lies and I know it isn't with Voldemort since you want to kill him as much as I do."

There was a fleeting look of surprise on Snape's face before it smoothed into a thoughtful expression. "I could try," he eventually said.

"If Igor is involved in some way," Albus said, with a disapproving look in Sirius's direction, "you may draw Tom's attention."

Snape bowed his head in acknowledgement. "I am certain I could convince him of my continued value as his spy within your ranks, Headmaster."

Albus raised his eyebrows. "And within Sirius's ranks? Do you honestly think that he will believe you have managed to ingratiate yourself with Sirius, with the known animosity between the two of you?"

"He will believe that I am attempting to place myself usefully for him at great expense to my own pride, and that Black continues to distrust me," Snape said dryly, "but that I look forward to the day when he might reward me with the honour of killing Black to make up for my having to have anything to do with Black at all."

Sirius laughed because he knew it would work. Not to mention that on some level Snape probably did want to kill him.

"And all this presupposes Karkaroff is helping Riddle." Amelia pointed out.

Bertie chuckled at Moody's grumpy expression. "I wouldn't bet against Alastor in this instance."

Moody harrumphed. "I'll be increasing the patrols by the ship in any case." He sighed. "We've also had an unknown animagus register on the wards but…the first sign of them was the day of the task so could have been anyone including someone authorised to attend."

"Is it possible that Crouch Junior is an unregistered animagus?" Amelia asked.

"He did not have such a skill when he was at Hogwarts." Albus said.

Remus frowned. "But he could have learned to become an animagus between leaving Hogwarts and being imprisoned in Azkaban."

"If he did, then why didn't he use his form to escape his father?" Sirius asked pointedly. "Fair enough he might have been confused all of the time but…as an animagus I have to say that it's unlikely it would never have entered his head to change form even if it was to escape the immediate horror of his captivity."

From the varying expressions of pity to horror on the faces around him, Sirius realised he might have given his own past away with his words.

"It's all speculation." Moody snorted, yanking everyone's attention back on track. "We'll keep an eye on the wards for any other instances."

Sirius noticed Remus had his 'I have a thought but need to think about it more' face. He left him alone. "So that's what we're left with: tightening security and maintaining vigilance."

"Our next task is February." Albus said. "It gives us plenty of time to prepare."

"But there is the Yule Ball." Amelia said. "If I were Riddle I would be tempted to do something."

Albus sighed. "Yes, Tom always did have a flare for dramatics."

"Moving on then," Sirius nodded toward Cornelius.

Cornelius puffed up proudly. "Harry's outstanding performance against the dragon has led to some of those we are seeking alliances with on the neutral side to reconsider their reluctance to ally with us." He squirmed with glee. "Sirius and I have received a number of invitations since the first task which we will follow up." He made a small gesture with his cup. "Possibly we will be unable to convert them into reality before the December Wizengamot, but it may still benefit us in validating the report from the Committee looking into the magical creature laws."

"Lucius reports a similar state of reconsideration among the pureblood houses." Sirius said. "Even if nothing comes of it immediately, it may hamper Wenlock's opposition."

"Excellent news." Albus beamed at them and Cornelius soaked up the approval like a sponge.

"We've got some good news too since we found the missing pregnant woman." Amelia said. "However she is in the same state as the Crouch elf and so we're waiting on a revival potion."

Sirius glanced at Snape.

"With the blood from the woman I have narrowed it to two possible potions that were used." Snape informed them briskly. "I am now waiting on a Blood Revelation potion to brew for the next set of tests."

"You should come work for me when this is all over." Bertie said, sipping his drink, "we could use someone with your skills in potions."

Sirius noticed how stunned and hopeful Snape looked in the brief second before he controlled his reaction. He wondered if it had once been a dream of Snape's to work for the DOM before he'd succumbed to the lure of the Death Eaters. He had never really considered that Snape would have had dreams, wants, hopes when they had both been school boys at odds with one another. He had been too immersed in his own troubles to view Snape as anything other than a nemesis rather than a boy like himself. Was it a sign of maturity that he finally saw Snape as a human being with all of the flaws and dreams being human entailed?

That was a scary thought.

Sirius mentally shook away his entire train of thought as Amelia continued confirming that they believed Voldemort and Peter at least to be in London.

"Do we think Pettigrew's sudden decision to provide information sincere?" Amelia asked bluntly.

Sirius frowned as he and Remus glanced toward each other, confirming their shared thought of 'not bloody likely.'

"Peter's probably hedging his bets." Remus said diplomatically.

"Trying to cover his arse." Sirius muttered with disgust.

"Perhaps he is truly regretful." Albus's tone was softly chiding.

"He is trying to ensure that I won't just kill him." Sirius corrected sharply. "I don't doubt any information he provides may be useful but let's not kid ourselves that he's doing it for any other reason than because he wants to save himself."

"So we can't count on him fully changing sides and telling us where he is." Amelia cut in before Albus could wax lyrical about redemption and second chances.

"Not until it's beyond question which side will win." Remus confirmed.

Sirius motioned at Bertie who grimaced around a mouthful of tea.

He swallowed hastily. "My news isn't so good. The Treasure Hunt is on-going. We haven't had any luck locating the remaining item so far." He sighed. "Our search continues." He gestured at Remus. "Bill mentioned that you'd suggested talking to the ghosts and portraits?"

Remus nodded. "It was just a thought. They might have seen Riddle hide it."

Albus made a sudden noise of exclamation. "Of course! We should talk to the Ravenclaw ghost!"

They all looked at him with varying expressions of quizzical bewilderment.

"The Ravenclaw ghost is the daughter of Rowena Ravenclaw." Albus explained, as though they all should have known.

"You couldn't have mentioned this earlier?" Bertie sighed.

Albus appeared suitably recalcitrant. "Alas, it did not occur to me."

"Don't the ghosts have to answer any questions you ask?" Remus asked.

"Not exactly. The ghosts know they are allowed to remain at Hogwarts at the Headmaster's pleasure, therefore they are honour bound to answer any questions." Albus explained.

"But they can choose not to." Bertie said, nodding understandingly. "Still it might be wise to have you with us when we question her."

Albus agreed readily and the War Council was done for another day.

Sirius wandered back to his rooms, a quiet and contemplative Remus beside him. They entered to find Harry immersed in homework at the dining table. They slid into seats, Sirius taking the chair next to Harry while Remus sat opposite.

Harry raised his head briefly. "How did it go?"

"Pretty much confirmed what we already knew." Sirius said and went over the main points for his son.

"If it's official that the Horntail was sabotaged," Harry said with a deep frown, "that means Fleur was unfairly challenged during the task."

"I'm not sure it changed the outcome by much." Remus said. "Her sleep spell just wasn't strong enough."

"But she might have been able to save one of the eggs," Harry argued, "or avoided getting hurt."

Sirius felt a rush of pride. Harry had such a good heart. "I'll raise it with Albus." He promised.

Harry smiled at him.

Sirius turned to Remus. "And you," he wagged a finger at him, "what have you been thinking about?"

Remus gave a sheepish sigh. "I was wondering whether it would be appropriate to make some discreet personal enquiries to see if Minister Oblansk would give us permission to search the Durmstrang ship."

"You mean avoid the official channels and request it as a favour?" Sirius asked marvelling at Remus's lateral thinking. It might work. "You and Bogdan did get on well at the World Cup."

"We'd still have to be cautious about how we asked and probably bring Cornelius in to give us cover if it went pear-shaped." Remus cautioned.

"It's a good idea." Sirius said.

"It's a brilliant idea!" Harry added enthusiastically. "I can also ask Viktor to watch for anything suspicious on the ship. I mean," he said swiftly seeing the objection Sirius was going to make, "not to go looking but just if anything looks odd to let us know."

Sirius hummed as he considered the idea. Viktor seemed on the level but it was risky trusting him. However it was a good suggestion.

"Maybe you should bring all the Champions in on the news of the sabotage." Sirius began. "Ask them all to keep a look out. We honestly don't know for certain that Junior is working with Karkaroff and is hiding on the ship. They might wear different uniforms next time."

Harry nodded. "I'll talk with them at Quidditch practice."

"And I'll send word to speak with Bogdan via Tomas when I'm next in France." Remus said.

"Is that before or after your date with Tonks?" asked Harry slyly.

"It is not a date!" Remus immediately denied. "We're going for a friendly drink so I can inform Tonks my interest is elsewhere."

"Really?" Harry's eyebrows shot skyward as though in surprise although Sirius knew he was well aware of Remus's interest in a female werewolf back at the chateau since Sirius had informed Harry himself.

Remus hurriedly got to his feet. "I should go. Lots to do." He was barely out of the door before both Harry and Sirius dissolved into laughter.

o-O-o

*26th November 1994*

Remus tapped his foot impatiently as he waited for Tonks to arrive. He really wasn't looking forward to the next hour. He liked Tonks and he didn't want to make things awkward with her. But he couldn't allow her to continue to send him suggestive messages when he wasn't interested in her romantically; when he was looking forward to returning to France and seeing Clara again.

The floo chimed and Tonks walked out with her usual sassy confidence. She was wearing muggle clothing; blue jeans, a t-shirt proclaiming her love for an obscure muggle rock band, boots and a thick leather jacket. Her hair was a bright pink matching the colour of her top.

"You're looking good, Remus." Tonks winked.

Remus raised an eyebrow. He had also dressed in muggle wear of black jeans, an old flannel shirt in a washed out green, boots and a short woollen black jacket.

"Shall we?" Remus motioned at the floo.

They made their way to The Leaky Cauldron. Remus found them a quiet corner and bought them two pints of ale.

"Tonks," he began, "these notes that you've been sending me..."

"Got your attention, didn't it?" Tonks said, grinning. "You're a hard man to pin down."

"Then, you're serious?" Remus questioned, a tad stunned that she hadn't immediately laughed it off and admitted it was all a joke.

Tonks lowered her drink and regarded him with a slight frown. "You thought I was making fun of you?"

"The thought had crossed my mind." Remus said mildly. It had happened once before with a witch at school.

"Then let me assure you," Tonks said, "I'm very serious. I was made up when Sirius mentioned at dinner that you were looking for a relationship." Her grey eyes shone with nothing but sincerity which made Remus's heart sink as he considered what he had to tell her.

Remus shifted in his seat. "The thing is that when Sirius used me as a way of diverting attention from his own lack of a love life, he wasn't aware that I was already interested in someone." He fidgeted with his glass as comprehension filled Tonks' face.

"Ah," she winced in a dramatic fashion, "and I'm guessing it isn't me that's caught your eye?"

"I'm afraid not, Tonks." Remus agreed gently.

"Bugger." Tonks said, slumping back in her chair, amusement beginning to overtake the embarrassment of the moment. "And I thought I was so clever getting in before anyone else."

Remus blushed.

She sipped her ale and eyed him speculatively. "Well, I guess I shall have to settle for being your best girl buddy."

Remus almost spit out his mouthful of ale. "Sorry?"

"You know," Tonks grinned, "the girl buddy you talk to when you need advice about girls and fashion and," she made a circular gesture with one hand, "things you don't want to talk about with a bloke."

"Oh, you mean a *girl buddy*." Remus said teasingly. "Yeah, it's been a while since I've had one of those." Sadness coloured the last of his words despite his intention to keep it light.

"Lily?" Tonks inquired gently.

Remus nodded. "She kind of adopted all of the Marauders when she married James."

"I think I met her?" Tonks said. "Sirius brought her by with James when I was little. I remember thinking she was the most beautiful woman I'd ever seen. I insisted on my hair being her colour for days after."

"You met her quite a few times I think." Remus said. "You'd be too young to remember. Sirius tried to stay in touch as much as he could with your mother, and, of course, it was rare to find Sirius without James even after James's marriage."

"Did you mind?" Tonks asked with genuine interest.

"Sometimes," Remus admitted, "mostly when James would take Sirius's side in something, not because it was right but because it was Sirius." He frowned. "I never realised back then how much Sirius did the same for James. They were closer than brothers but then they were friends from the first whereas it took a little time for the four of us as a group to properly gel."

Tonks took a gulp of her drink. "It's weird. Whenever I think about you guys at school, I always just assume that you came fully formed as Marauders. Sirius used to tell me stories when he visited when I was a kid." She peeked at him over her glass. "That's partially why I had such a crush on you. He made you all sound so cool."

Remus chuckled. "Our being friends didn't happen overnight." He shrugged. "I think Peter and I assumed Sirius and James had been friends for years; they just had that vibe from the get-go despite only meeting on the train." He sipped his ale. "Neither of us wanted to intrude so we ended up hanging around each other by default. It wasn't until…Peter and I got cornered by a group of older Slytherins near the library. We were outnumbered but suddenly James and Sirius were there, and the four of us made short work of the six of them. That was when we all started to hang around together."

"That sounds like Sirius." Tonks said. "Taking on Slytherins and fighting."

"He has a surprisingly good heart." Remus said defensively although her tone was fond and teasing rather than critical. He raised his half empty glass. "Most people miss that."

"I don't think anyone can deny it with everything he's done for Harry." Tonks said, motioning with her glass.

Remus shrugged. "You'd be surprised. There are still some who focus on his name and the reputation of his family. I've heard people say he took Harry to gain power, to increase his political base; not because he truly loves him."

Tonks nodded slowly. "I can relate on the family front." She tipped her glass in Remus's direction. "I get comments occasionally, and I'm not even a Black by name."

Remus tilted his head in her direction. "You did inherit the eyes."

Tonks grimaced. "I look like my Aunt Bella naturally. So you can understand why I morph into looking more like the Tonks side."

"Your mother doesn't mind?" Remus asked.

"I think she understands." Tonks said. "She's always been supportive. I had a pretty tough time at school until I settled on a base form."

Remus could guess at what kind of issues Tonks had faced especially with teenage boys and girls; the boys would be crude and the girls jealous.

Tonks smiled suddenly. "You don't have to look so fierce on my behalf, Remus. Any hurt was long healed and I did have a few good friends."

Remus huffed out an amused sigh. He set his glass down, slightly surprised to find it empty.

Tonks nodded at it, draining her own. "My round. You can tell me all about the lady who beat me to you."

Remus didn't have time to protest; she was gone with the empty glasses. He relaxed in his chair, relieved the discussion had gone so well, and credited Tonks for her graciousness in the face of his rejection.

A sudden movement yanked his attention from his thoughts as Sian slid into the chair Tonks had vacated. She looked grim.

"Sian, what's wrong?" Remus asked urgently, knowing it had to be bad for her to approach him so publicly.

"Fenrir came back to the pack yesterday." Sian said. "He asked for volunteers to complete a mission for the Dark Lord."

Remus glanced around anxiously. "We need to find somewhere more private."

He stood up and herded her in front of him to the bar where Tonks was waiting to be served. He tapped Tonks on the shoulder. She raised an eyebrow at the sight of Sian.

"I leave you alone for a minute and you find another girl?" She teased.

Remus flushed but focused on the immediate issue. "Tonks, Sian's an old friend. Would you be OK if we got the next round at your place?" He hoped his pleading expression was enough to make her comply without any other kind of explanation.

Her grey eyes so like Sirius's narrowed but she pushed away from the bar with a shrug. "Sure. Shall we use the floo?"

It took little more than a few minutes for them to travel to Tonks' small flat. She locked down the floo and smiled ruefully as she picked up some scattered clothing.

"Sorry for the mess," Tonks grinned suddenly, "I wasn't expecting to get this lucky on a first date."

Remus rolled his eyes at her.

"Remus..." Sian started to protest, bristling at the implication that Remus had revealed her to nothing more than a casual romantic interest.

"Introductions," he declared quickly, "Tonks, this is Sian, a member of Fenrir's pack. She has information."

He was relieved to see Tonks sobered, assuming a demeanour more in keeping with her job as an Auror.

"And Sian, this is Tonks, otherwise known as Sirius's cousin, and she's also an Auror."

Sian subsided, perching on a chair, her dark hair falling over her face.

Tonks sat down opposite her, a pile of clothing in her arms. "What can you tell us?"

"Fenrir called a pack meeting yesterday." Sian said tersely. "He said the Dark Lord had given the pack a mission and asked for volunteers."

Remus frowned. "What was the mission?"

"The usual; frightening the Dark Lord's enemies, harassment, that kind of thing." Sian raised a hand to her brow and rubbed it. Remus was suddenly aware of how weary she looked. "He mentioned the Potter alliance and someone called Dirk Cresswell?"

"Isn't Cresswell heading up the Committee reviewing the magical creature laws?" Tonks asked Remus.

He nodded, leaning back against the breakfast bar that separated Tonks' tiny living area from an equally tiny kitchenette. "Doesn't Fenrir understand that attacking the people supporting positive laws for werewolves is counterproductive?"

"You know Fenrir," Sian said bluntly, "all he wants is the blood and the fight. He doesn't actually care that he might be undermining any chance of werewolves getting fair treatment. Someone did question him during the meeting and he blustered how under the Dark Lord we wouldn't have any kind of restrictions – which is a load of bullshit because some of us remember that all Voldemort wants to do is put a leash on us until he wants someone bitten or intimidated."

"But?" asked Tonks.

"But some of the younger ones fell for it." Sian grimaced. "They're sore about the laws and think the whole review is a front for coming up with even worse restrictions."

"Fabulous." Remus pinched the bridge of his nose. Fenrir had volunteers to menace the Potter alliance and Cresswell; it was definitely bad news.

"Were you able to get any other details?" Tonks pressed, and Remus was glad she was there and still thinking strategically because he was just a mass of boiling emotions. "Timing? Sequence of targets?"

"The first target is just before the Wizengamot session on the seventh of December." Sian said. "He didn't say about the others and he didn't say who in particular would be targeted. I can't go back, Remus." She said, turning to him. "Alan, the one who questioned him, was killed this morning and it was probably for questioning him. Fenrir's suspicious about me as it is; he knows I've never liked his leadership."

"We can floo to Auror headquarters," Tonks said soothingly, "you'll need to make a formal report and we'll give you a safe house."

"What about the chateau?" asked Sian. "Why can't I go there like the others?"

Remus nodded at Tonks. "Surely she'll be safe there?"

Tonks frowned. "Honestly, I don't think Director Bones will let her leave until the attacks are done and even then…she should officially be in protective custody as an informant and witness."

Sian grimaced and shook her head. "I can't be in custody, Remus." She glanced up at him. "Please."

He sighed. Sian had acted at great personal risk to bring them the information. "If Amelia and Sirius agree, you can stay with me. Hopefully that will be an acceptable compromise?"

Sian's relief was so obviously evident that Remus didn't automatically regret giving into her plea.

"You'll still have to make a formal report." Tonks said firmly. She stood up and chucked her armful of clothing back on the sofa. "Why don't you go into the kitchen and get something to drink? I'll floo call the Director and see whether she wants us to come in or we can do it here."

Remus led Sian around the breakfast bar and into the small space. "What would you like?"

"Water will do." Sian said. She thrust a hand toward the living area where Tonks' quiet murmur could be heard. "Your girlfriend?"

"Not that it's any of your business but she's just a friend." Remus corrected briskly.

Sian breathed out audibly. "Sorry, I was…I was just concerned that I might have intruded on your date or caused problems by staying with you."

It was a thought, Remus considered with chagrin. Tonks was just a friend regardless of her proclaimed interest but how was *Clara* going to react to his suddenly getting a house-guest in the form of an attractive woman? He would just have to cross that bridge when he came to it, Remus decided; it was still very early days with Clara anyway – he hadn't even declared his interest in her to Clara herself.

Tonks popped up in front of the breakfast bar. "The Director says I can take the formal report here but she's sending Kingsley to support me. She's also going to alert Sirius so I figure we'll wait until they arrive before we set-up."

Sian pulled at her top. "Do you have somewhere I can freshen up, please?"

"'Course." Tonks gestured at her. "Let me show you the bathroom."

Sian followed her out of the living area and Remus took the opportunity of a moment alone to gather his composure. He didn't have long as Tonks returned almost immediately.

"You look like you need something stronger than tea. There's some Scotch in the cupboard." Tonks offered brightly. "I keep it for my Dad."

Remus sighed but opened up the door she was pointing at.

"So," Tonks said, resting a hip against the bar and gazing at him speculatively, "is she…"

"No," Remus said hastily, "definitely; no." He brought down the scotch and Tonks reached over to the sink to pass him a clean glass. He poured himself a generous measure. "Sian and I were friends when I was spying back in 'eighty-'eighty-one. There's no interest on either side."

Tonks cast a look toward the bathroom. "I don't know, I think there might be interest on her side, Remus." She smiled self-deprecatingly. "Maybe because I'm interested myself, I can recognise it in her."

The floo chimed and Remus had the absent thought that he'd been saved by the bell.

"I'd best get that." Tonks said cheerfully and departed.

Remus was left behind, speechless. Sian? There was no way and…it wasn't worth thinking about! Tonks was wrong; she had to be! He felt a guilty twinge again about Tonks herself but pushed it away forcefully. Tonks was young and beautiful; she'd find someone for herself soon enough – someone better than an old wolf like Remus. He was interested in Clara – Clara who didn't know he was interested in her and who might not be interested in him.

He wondered again how his life had suddenly gotten so romantically complicated just as Sian re-entered and smiled at him nervously, and Tonks gestured over the breakfast bar for them to join her in the living area.

Maybe Padfoot had the right idea, Remus thought with dark humour; maybe it was simpler to focus on Harry and forget all about other entanglements. Remus downed his scotch; he had a feeling was going to need it.

o-O-o

Harry had timed his date with Hermione for when everyone else would be at lunch. He entered the Gryffindor Common Room with a spring in his step and was thrilled to find Hermione waiting for him on their usual sofa, dressed in casual clothes of jeans and a warm-looking lavender jumper. She'd done something to her hair again, leaving it pinned back behind her ears with two silver clasps on either side. For the first time he could remember she was wearing lip gloss; it made her lips shine and thoughts of what would hopefully be their first kiss later that day zipped through Harry's thoughts.

"Hey." Harry smiled at her, set down the picnic basket he was carrying and offered her another rose; a red one in full bloom with bright green leaves. "You look great."

Hermione took the rose and smelled its fragrance. "Thank you, and so do you." Her eyes swept over him and Harry was conscious of his own jeans and green cable-knit jumper.

"When are you expected back?" Harry questioned.

"Before dinner. Ron said he'd sound an alarm if I was any later." Hermione gave a rueful smile. "I think he enjoyed setting me a curfew far too much but I guess it's better to be safe. You?"

"Sirius said he'd come looking for me around sixish if I hadn't surfaced by then." Harry said happily. "So we have all afternoon." He brandished the invisibility cloak. "We should go before someone comes back."

Hermione nodded and Harry tucked the cloak around the two of them. The days when the cloak would have comfortably covered Harry, Hermione and Ron were long gone. Even with just the two of them it was close quarters, but Harry didn't mind and he didn't think Hermione did either. He hunched down to grab the basket of food and straightened the cloak one last time. They walked out of the portrait and Harry directed Hermione through the school to the seventh floor.

"Where are we going?" hissed Hermione.

"It's a surprise," Harry said, "Dobby found this great room – and well, you'll see." He grinned at her. They paused in front of a portrait of Barnabas the Barmy and Harry checked the Marauders' map to ensure there was no-one around before he carefully took off the cloak, motioning for Hermione to stand to the side. He paced up and down three times in front of what looked like an empty wall. On the completion of the third pacing, a door suddenly appeared.

Harry opened it and ushered Hermione through and closed the door behind them.

It was the platform at King's Cross with the Hogwarts Express standing ready for a journey.

"Oh my God!" Hermione stared back at the wall with the door, at the train, at the door and shook her head. "What is this place?"

"Dobby said the elves call it the Room of Requirement." Harry said succinctly, packing away the cloak. "You think up what you want outside the door, pace back and forth with that in your mind, and…" he gestured around what looked like the train platform, "and it creates it for you." He absently minded rubbed at the thin line of his scar, a niggling itch teasing at him.

"This is just…" Hermione shook her head again. "How does it do it? Where does it get all these things?"

"I think some of it is an illusion?" Harry pointed at the far distance and the view down the tracks. "And you can't take things out that are created here; I tried that and it doesn't work. Food doesn't just appear either although the elves can bring some.

"So maybe a temporary conjuring charm of some kind?" Hermione said with wonder.

Harry shrugged. He had less interest in knowing how the room worked; he was just pleased it did. "Come on. I thought we'd have lunch on the train?" he hesitated suddenly, "if that's OK with you?"

Hermione smiled at him, reassuringly. "More than OK." Her eyes met his with understanding. "We first met on the train, didn't we? So it's kind of appropriate we have our first date there."

He was thrilled she'd gotten his thinking on the venue and offered her his hand to help her up the step and into the carriage. It was identical to the one that he'd occupied on his first train journey except there was no Ron or luggage cluttering the space.

Harry set the picnic basket on the floor and took out a blanket for the floor. Hermione helped him spread it on the floor and then they began to unload the food. He'd asked Dobby to pack Hermione's favourites and so he wasn't surprised to find a healthy option of a chicken salad accompanied with fresh warm bread rolls tucked within the spacious inside. There were slices of apple pie for dessert and Dobby had included a sparkling grape juice that looked like wine but wasn't. He poured them both a glass as Hermione served the food. They finished and sat cross-legged next to each other, using the seats in the carriage as back-rests.

Harry raised his glass. "To our first date." He said, a little nervous all over again.

"To our first date." Hermione parroted, smiling.

They gently touched their glasses together and took a sip. They shifted to eat and for a while sat in a companionable silence.

Hermione chuckled suddenly. He looked over at her questioningly.

"I was just thinking that I'm so nervous and how stupid that is since it's you and me, and we know each other." Hermione explained with chagrin.

He grinned at her sheepishly. "I know; me too."

Hermione assumed a determined look that Harry knew all too well. "So we should stop being nervous and just enjoy the time together."

Harry readily agreed. He hadn't been able to spend a great deal of time alone with Hermione with his new living accommodations, and while he didn't regret living with Sirius at Hogwarts, it did cut down on his time with his friends.

She gestured at him with a fork. "How are you getting on with the clues in the egg?"

Harry winced. "It was a poem written in Mermish. Thankfully, Remus knows the language."

Hermione raised her eyebrows, waving her fork enthusiastically to encourage him to continue as she had a mouthful of food.

"Water, water, everywhere; of your prized possession take great care; for prisoners rarely work together; and time will not last forever." Harry recited from memory.

Hermione grimaced. "That's the clues?"

"At least I have the whole thing." Harry pointed out. "Cedric only has the one line and the judges just agreed that because of the Horntail being sabotaged, Fleur will get that one too. Viktor has two lines." He swallowed some chicken. "I think the task is going to either be on the top of the lake or under it."

"Water, water, everywhere…" Hermione nodded briskly. "That makes sense." She scooped up some coleslaw. "It sounds like they're going to make you rescue your prized possession. The second task is typically about retrieving something."

"Which is weird," Harry said, "because I'd notice if any of my stuff went missing – and I'm really not attached to very much." There was the photo album of his parents, his invisibility cloak and his Firebolt. Everything else was, in Harry's opinion, expendable.

"Maybe," Hermione began hesitantly, "maybe they mean a person? They've used human hostages in three previous tournaments."

Harry felt his stutter in his chest. It was his worst nightmare; someone else in danger because of him.

"It might not be!" Hermione hastened to comfort him. It's just the third line about prisoners suggests that someone will be a prisoner and the options are the Champions or someone else so…"

"No, you're probably right." Harry said somewhat sourly. "But how would they choose someone?" He set his lunch aside and picked up his drink. "I mean, I have a few people who I, uh, care about."

"When the tasks have called for a participant to be associated with the Champion in the past," Hermione said, "the tournament judges enter a list of possibilities into the Goblet and the Goblet chooses."

"Great," Harry sighed, "because that's completely fool-proof." He adjusted his glasses. "I guess from the last line there'll be a time limit which you know makes me think what happens to the someone or something if you don't achieve rescuing it – *them* – in time?"

"Good question." Hermione said, putting her own plate aside and picking up her drink. "If it was the tasks as they were previously designed I'm pretty sure that it wouldn't be bad. I can't see Professor Dumbledore or Madame Maxime allowing a lethal consequence."

"But all bets are off since Voldemort rewrote the tasks." Harry sighed and drank some of his juice. He felt his mood darkening and shoved his impending brooding away to focus on his date. "And I think we should stop talking about the tournament."

"Probably that's a good idea." Hermione admitted. "So what would you like to talk about?"

"Well, dating is supposed to be about getting to know each other better, right?" Harry warmed to his suggestion immediately. "How about we ask each other questions? I'm sure there's loads of stuff we don't know about each other?"

Hermione nodded happily. "Shall we have dessert too?"

There were a few minutes of organising themselves and the plates of warm apple pie, (Harry dolloped a lump of cream on top but Hermione kept hers plain), before they resettled into their previous positions, slightly turned towards one another.

"So you can go first?" Harry offered, licking his spoon.

Hermione pressed her lips together thoughtfully. "What's your happiest memory before Hogwarts?"

Harry frowned. He didn't have a lot of happy memories before Hogwarts because of the Dursleys. But he did have a couple and he picked the one he liked best.

"Probably my first day at infants." Harry said. "I can remember the classroom seemed huge and we had these round tables where we sat. I was so pleased when Dudley went off to the purple table on the other side of the room, and I was on the blue. And the whole day just was great. Dudley had temper tantrums and kept getting hauled to sit in the corner to think about his actions while I was able to colour and do my writing and…it was great that first day."

It had gone pear-shaped within a few weeks – as soon as Dudley found friends and Harry in his shyness struggled; as Dudley found ways to torment Harry at school; when Petunia hadn't been interested in anything Harry did at school, any of his achievements or the pictures he drew.

"What about you?" asked Harry. "What's your happiest memory before Hogwarts?"

"Well, my first day of school is probably up there too." Hermione said with a rueful smile. She nudged his shoulder with hers. "You could act shocked."

"I am," teased Harry, "I'm very shocked."

"But," Hermione stressed, "I guess my happiest memories are of the Summers we used to spend at Gran's in Dorset. We used to have afternoon tea with scones and read books in the evening. It was great. She died when I was nine."

Harry nudged her gently with his knee. "Do you have aunts and uncles?"

Hermione shook her head and pushed her plate away. "My Dad did have a brother but he died in the Falklands War and, well, we don't really talk about him. Mum was an only child. They were aiming for two children but I was a difficult birth and so they settled for me." She bit her lip. "I kind of envy Ron sometimes having so many siblings but then…I think it would drive me mad."

"Me too." Harry admitted with a laugh. "The Weasleys are great but I imagine living in a house filled with more Dudleys and I cringe."

Hermione looked at him sympathetically. "Do you think you'll ever talk with them, I mean the Dursleys, again?"

Harry scooped up the last of his pie and considered his answer. "I don't know." He said eventually.

"You probably don't want to talk about it." Hermione said hurriedly. "I shouldn't have asked…"

"You can ask me anything." Harry interrupted her, holding her gaze firmly, "and it's not so much I don't want to talk about it as it's…difficult?"

"Things were pretty bad for you there, weren't they? More than you let on." Hermione said softly.

Harry shrugged, wanting despite his words to stop talking about it. "I knew that the way they treated me wasn't right but then…I guess I also didn't get how wrong it was until Sirius and…and it's the difference, you know? Not just the clothes and the rooms and the *things* but…Sirius always has time for me and if I draw something and give it to him, he'll display it somewhere, or he'll come and cheer me on at Quidditch. Little things." Little things that made it clear that Sirius cared for him; that he was important to Sirius. He shifted, deciding a change in subject was in order. "What about you and your parents?"

"We're closer again now that they have a way of connecting with the wizarding world." Hermione said, brightening. "The last few years, I've felt like I've been drifting away from them. There's so much about the wizarding world that they couldn't see or understand and I guess I stopped explaining things to them because I didn't want to worry them."

"I'm glad. I like your parents." Harry said.

"They like you too." Hermione blushed a little. "They're pleased we're dating."

Harry felt his own cheeks heat. "Yeah, Sirius is chuffed too."

They smiled happily at each other.

It felt like a moment; *the* moment.

Harry set his glass aside with suddenly clumsy fingers. Hermione had left hers on the floor so he didn't need to worry about upending a glass of juice on her. He held her gaze for a second, the question of 'is it OK?' travelling silently between them and Hermione gave an almost imperceptible nod, her cheeks flaring red again.

He leaned in, tilted his head…

She shifted closer…

He closed his eyes at the last minute…

And their lips met, a soft press before they gently moved and…

They were kissing.

*Kissing.*

His heart raced as he eased away, elation stampeding through him. He held out his hand and she tangled their fingers together in a way that had become so familiar since he'd asked her out.

"Was that…" Harry began awkwardly, although he didn't think Hermione was going to say it was awful because she looked the way he felt; giddy and happy and…

"Perfect." Hermione stated firmly. Her eyes sparkled. "Especially since Professor Dumbledore didn't walk in on us too."

Harry gave a huff of laughter.

Hermione squeezed his hand. "I wouldn't say no to a second."

He grinned at her with what was probably a very sappy expression. "Yeah?"

"Well, it's like you and Quidditch." Hermione said primly, although her face was alight with humour and affection. "I mean, it was perfect but we wouldn't want to let the quality of our performance slide through lack of practice."

"Definitely not." Harry happily agreed.

And as his lips met hers again, and his soul went flying without the help of any kind of magic, he decided that he'd found something that was much, much better than Quidditch.
