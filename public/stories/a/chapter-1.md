# Chapter 1

The warehouse in Prague's Smíchov district had been abandoned for three years. Aris knew this because he'd checked the records before choosing it as a meeting point—long enough for the local gangs to strip the copper, short enough that the structure remained sound. The January cold seeped through gaps in the corrugated metal walls, carrying the smell of the Vltava River and diesel exhaust from the nearby train yard.

He stood in the center of the empty floor, hands in the pockets of his leather jacket, breath misting in the dim light filtering through grimy windows twenty feet overhead. The crate at his feet contained exactly what his contact had promised: six HYDRA energy cells, each one pulsing with a faint blue glow visible through the reinforced case. Stolen from a black market dealer in Minsk, now being sold to the highest bidder.

The highest bidder, in this case, being a man who had no intention of paying.

Footsteps echoed from the north entrance—three sets, measured and confident. Aris didn't turn. He closed his eyes and felt them instead: the bioelectric signatures of three human nervous systems, the electromagnetic fields of their weapons, the residual heat from a car engine that had been running fifteen minutes ago. The world painted itself in his mind through pure energy, more detailed than sight could ever provide.

"Mr. Volkov," a voice called out in Russian-accented English. "You are early."

"Punctuality is a virtue," Aris replied in flawless Russian, though that wasn't the language he'd learned it in. He'd picked it up in Saint Petersburg in 1987, along with three bullet wounds and a healthy distrust of former KGB operatives. The man approaching—Dmitri Volkov, arms dealer and thoroughly unpleasant individual—had that particular brand of smug cruelty that came from years of getting away with murder. Literally, in his case.

Volkov stopped ten feet away, flanked by two men in dark tactical gear. One carried a briefcase that supposedly contained three million euros. The other carried an MPX submachine gun, held with the casual readiness of someone who'd used it before.

"You brought the merchandise?" Volkov asked.

Aris opened his eyes and gestured at the crate. "As promised. Intact, fully charged, and completely untraceable. HYDRA's loss is your gain."

Volkov smiled, the expression not reaching his eyes. "I appreciate a professional. It makes what comes next so much simpler."

The man with the submachine gun raised it in a smooth motion. Aris sighed.

"You know," he said conversationally, "I actually hoped you'd surprise me. Just once, I'd like one of you bastards to actually pay for the merchandise instead of trying to kill me for it."

"Nothing personal," Volkov said. "Business."

The gunman fired.

The bullets never reached Aris. They stopped three feet away, suspended in midair, their kinetic energy bleeding off into the space around him in a shimmer of heat distortion. The gunman emptied half his magazine before realizing the futility, each round joining the growing cluster of floating metal.

Silence fell. The casings clinked as they hit the concrete floor.

"My turn," Aris said quietly.

He didn't move his hands from his pockets. Didn't need to. The energy in the bullets—kinetic, thermal, the electromagnetic signature of the gunpowder combustion—all of it flowed into him like water finding a crack. It felt like drinking lightning, a sharp electric taste that made his teeth ache. Then he pushed it back out.

The bullets shot backward, each one finding the concrete centimeters from the gunman's feet, embedding in a perfect circle around him. A warning. The man stumbled back with a shout, the submachine gun clattering to the floor.

Volkov had gone pale. "What are you?"

"Disappointed," Aris replied. He pulled his right hand from his pocket and held it palm-up. A sphere of blue-white light formed above his skin, crackling with stolen kinetic energy. "I came here in good faith. You brought guns. That's just rude."

The second bodyguard reached for his weapon. Aris clenched his fist and the light sphere vanished. Every electronic device in the warehouse died simultaneously—phones, gun sights, even the battery-powered emergency lights. The electromagnetic pulse radiated out in a controlled wave, precisely calibrated. When the lights flickered back on two seconds later, both bodyguards were on the ground, unconscious, their nervous systems temporarily overloaded.

Volkov stood alone, hands raised, all his bravado evaporated.

"Please," he stammered. "Please, I can get the money—real money, whatever you want—"

"I wanted professionalism," Aris interrupted, walking toward him. Each step echoed in the cavernous space. "I wanted a clean transaction. You wanted to play games." He stopped an arm's length away, and Volkov flinched. "Here's what's going to happen. You're going to leave. You're going to tell everyone you know that trying to cheat Aris Kaine is a bad idea. And you're going to pray I don't decide you're more trouble than you're worth."

"Yes, yes of course—"

"I'm not finished." Aris let a flicker of energy dance across his knuckles, just enough to make Volkov's eyes widen. "The HYDRA cells stay with me. You forfeit your claim. And you're going to funnel me information—anything you hear about unusual weapons, experimental technology, anything that smells like HYDRA remnants. Consider it the price of walking out of here."

Volkov nodded frantically. "Anything. I'll tell you everything."

"Good." Aris gestured toward the door. "Now get out."

The arms dealer didn't need to be told twice. He bolted, leaving his unconscious men and the briefcase of fake money behind. Aris waited until the sound of a car engine faded into the Prague night before allowing himself to relax.

The energy he'd absorbed from the bullets and the pulse sat heavy in his chest, a familiar ache. Too much, too fast. He could feel it trying to disperse through his nervous system, looking for an outlet. Using his abilities always came with a cost—the energy had to go somewhere, and holding it inside felt like gripping broken glass.

He knelt beside the crate and placed both hands on the lid. The HYDRA energy cells hummed beneath his palms, each one containing enough power to level a city block if mishandled. Slowly, carefully, he let the excess energy bleed into the cells, recharging them beyond their original capacity. The broken-glass feeling eased, replaced by the hollow exhaustion that always followed.

Better.

Aris stood, lifting the crate with ease despite its two-hundred-pound weight, and headed for the south exit where he'd parked his motorcycle. He'd dump the cells with his contact in Berlin, collect his actual payment, and move on to the next job. The life of a freelance acquisition specialist—stealing from thieves, selling to the slightly less terrible thieves, and occasionally keeping the really dangerous items out of circulation entirely—wasn't glamorous, but it paid well and kept him busy.

Kept him from thinking too much about the decades that stretched behind him, or the ones that stretched ahead.

He was halfway to his motorcycle when his phone buzzed. Not the burner he used for business—his personal phone, the one only three people in the world had the number for. Aris frowned and pulled it out.

Unknown number. Text message.

*We need to talk. Coffee shop on Wenceslas Square, one hour. Come alone. -NR*

NR. Natasha Romanoff.

Aris stared at the message, pulse quickening despite himself. He'd encountered the Black Widow exactly twice—once in Budapest eighteen months ago when they'd both been after the same HYDRA scientist, and once in Manila six months later when she'd saved his life during an ambush he probably should have seen coming. Both times, she'd vanished before he could thank her properly. Or ask why a SHIELD operative kept crossing paths with a notorious freelancer.

He typed a response: *How did you get this number?*

The reply came immediately: *You're not the only one who's good at finding things. One hour.*

Against his better judgment, Aris found himself smiling.

The coffee shop was called Café Louvre, a historic establishment with high ceilings and art nouveau fixtures. At eleven PM, it was nearly empty except for a handful of students hunched over laptops and a lone woman in the back corner booth.

Natasha Romanoff looked exactly like the intelligence photos Aris had seen—red hair pulled back in a practical ponytail, leather jacket over dark clothing, the kind of understated appearance that somehow made her more noticeable rather than less. She sat with her back to the wall, a half-empty cup of coffee in front of her, green eyes tracking his approach with the calm assessment of a predator evaluating potential prey.

"You're late," she said as he slid into the booth across from her.

"You're buying, then." Aris signaled the waiter and ordered black coffee in Czech. When the man left, he turned his attention back to Natasha. "I assume this isn't a social call."

"Do we have a social relationship?"

"We could. I'm very charming when I'm not being shot at."

The corner of her mouth twitched—not quite a smile, but close. "I need your help with something."

"SHIELD needs my help," Aris corrected. "Let's be accurate."

"SHIELD doesn't know I'm here." She pulled a tablet from her bag and slid it across the table. The screen showed satellite imagery of a facility in the mountains, coordinates indicating somewhere in the Caucasus. "This is a former Soviet research station. Officially abandoned in 1991. Unofficially, it's been active for the past six months."

Aris studied the images. The facility was built into the mountainside, mostly underground, with only a few surface structures visible. Recent construction, heavy security, and what looked like significant power consumption based on the thermal signatures.

"Let me guess," he said. "HYDRA?"

"We think so. The energy signature matches some of their experimental programs." She tapped the screen, zooming in on a particular building. "Three days ago, this facility went dark. No communications, no personnel movement, nothing. Then yesterday, a single transmission—heavily encrypted, but we caught fragments. Someone inside calling for help."

The waiter returned with Aris's coffee. He waited until the man left before responding. "And SHIELD can't mount an official operation because...?"

"Because we don't officially know it exists," Natasha said bluntly. "The Russian government denies any knowledge. If we send a team and it goes wrong, it's an international incident. But if a freelance operative with no official ties happens to investigate..."

"Deniability. How patriotic of you." Aris took a sip of coffee. It was terrible. "What's really in that facility, Romanoff? You didn't track me down for a basic recon mission."

She held his gaze for a long moment, clearly weighing how much to reveal. Finally: "We think they were working on human enhancement. Experimental subjects. If HYDRA's abandoned the facility, those subjects are either dead or..." She paused. "Or they're not."

"And you want me to find out which."

"I want you to get them out if they're still alive. And I want whatever data you can recover from the facility before someone else does."

Aris leaned back, studying her. In the warm light of the café, Natasha Romanoff looked younger than her file suggested—late twenties, maybe thirty at most. But her eyes carried the weight of someone much older. Someone who'd seen things, done things, and was still trying to make up for it.

He recognized that look. He saw it in the mirror sometimes.

"Why me?" he asked. "SHIELD has plenty of assets. You could call in a favor with one of the Avengers—I hear Iron Man loves a good rescue mission."

"Because the Avengers are too visible. Because most SHIELD assets can't handle what might be in that facility." She paused. "And because I've seen what you can do. You absorbed the blast from an RPG in Manila and redirected it into the ground. You have abilities that make you uniquely suited for this."

"Uniquely suited or uniquely expendable?"

"Both, probably." No hesitation, no attempt to soften it. Aris appreciated the honesty.

He looked down at the tablet again, at the dark facility nestled in hostile mountains. Every instinct told him to walk away. Getting involved with SHIELD, even unofficially, was asking for complications he didn't need. His life worked precisely because he stayed off the radar, played all sides, and never committed to anyone's agenda but his own.

But there were people in that facility. Maybe. People who'd been experimented on, abandoned, left to die in the dark.

Damn it.

"Payment?" he asked.

"Two hundred thousand euros, plus any salvage you can carry out that isn't classified research."

"Three hundred thousand. And I keep anything I find that's not directly related to human subjects."

Natasha didn't even blink. "Done. When can you leave?"

"Give me two days to finish my current business in Berlin. Then I'll need the full intelligence package—satellite coverage, facility layouts, whatever you have on the original research program." Aris met her eyes. "And Romanoff? If this goes sideways, if SHIELD decides to disavow me or leave me hanging, you and I are going to have a very different conversation next time we meet."

"If you get disavowed, I'll be right there with you," she said quietly. "This is my operation. I brought you in. If it fails, we both pay the price."

Something in her voice made him believe her. Aris nodded and stood, draining the last of his terrible coffee.

"Two days," he repeated. "I'll contact you with a meeting location for the intel handoff."

He was almost to the door when her voice stopped him.

"Kaine."

He turned.

"Thank you," Natasha said. "For Manila. I never got a chance to say it."

Aris smiled. "You can buy me a drink when this is over. Somewhere with better coffee."

He walked out into the Prague night, collar turned up against the January cold, and wondered what the hell he'd just agreed to.

Behind him, through the café window, Natasha Romanoff watched him disappear into the crowd. She picked up her phone and typed a brief message: *He's in.*

The response came from Nick Fury: *Good. Keep me posted. And Romanoff—be careful. We don't know what Kaine really is yet.*

Natasha deleted both messages and finished her coffee, thinking about a man who could catch bullets with his bare presence and redirect explosions into the earth. About someone who'd been operating in the shadows for years without SHIELD even knowing his real capabilities until Budapest.

About the way his eyes had changed when she mentioned the human subjects—the flash of something that looked like old, deep pain.

She'd done her research. Aris Kaine had no official records before 2003. No birth certificate, no passport, no digital footprint. He'd simply appeared in Istanbul fully formed, speaking twelve languages, with abilities that defied easy classification. In nine years, he'd built a reputation as the best acquisition specialist in the grey market—expensive, effective, and surprisingly ethical for a professional thief.

But where had he come from? What was he, really?

Natasha had a feeling she was about to find out.

She paid for both coffees, left a generous tip, and walked out into the cold Prague night. She had a lot of work to do in the next forty-eight hours. Starting with making sure the Russian facility stayed dark long enough for Kaine to reach it.

After all, she'd told him the truth: this was her operation. She'd brought him in.

And she never left her assets behind.
