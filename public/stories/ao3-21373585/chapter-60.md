**A/N: Had to split this one up, or I would've been even more late than I already am. Sorry 'bout that. I was also splitting my time between this and a side-project I've been working on. It was supposed to be another CP77 one-shot...but, that was about 200 pages ago, so...**

***~...AMP…~***

  
  

“And he just left?”

Hisashi watched as Toshinori stepped outside onto his balcony, looking out into the night sky, as if looking for any traces of Hawks. “Right after I mentioned the President. If there was anyone in charge of him, it would be her. And, uh...I’m assuming she knows about all this?”

Hisashi nodded over to Pixie Bob, who was standing next to him. She answered for herself, nodding her head, “I’m very late to the party, but yeah. He just told me an hour ago. I’m Ryuko Tsuchikawa, but most know me as-”

“Pixie Bob,” Hisashi cut her off, already knowing the answer. “Even if I wasn’t a fan, you’re kind of all over the Hero Gossip tabloids right now.”

Ryuko smirked, “You read Hero Gossip?”

“Wh-? U-Uh, I mean, not really. Just things that get mixed up into the current events, and uh…”

“Yes, he does,” Inko chuckled. “Every night before bed.”

“Moving on!” Hisashi quickly turned his attention back to All Might. “I’d say our time has been cut significantly shorter. With Nagant coming at them from one side, and us coming at them from the other, they’re scared. One person knowing their secret is already too many in their eyes.”

“To Hell with our time,” Toshinori shook his head as he stepped back into the apartment. “You’re staying at UA. We need to keep you both protected until this blows over.”

“Blows over?” Hisashi scoffed. “This won’t blow over until one side wins. They’ll try and keep us quiet for the rest of our lives. The investigation can’t stop.”

“It won’t. I’m not saying to go into hiding, but UA will give you far more protection than staying here.”

Hisashi sighed, but nodded his head, “Yeah, you’re right. I just didn’t think this would come crashing down on us so fast.”

“I’ll start packing,” Inko began to move back to the hallway, going to grab their suitcases from the hall closet. 

“It’s probably time to tell Izuku,” Hisashi sighed again.

Inko looked over her shoulder, sharing a glance with Toshinori. They knew it was entirely up to Izuku, but things were reaching the point where Hisashi being in the dark was making things a whole lot harder. 

“We’ll pull him and Young Jirou aside. Let’s also hold off on talking to those Tartarus guards. Maybe we can bring them to UA. I’m sure Nezu could-

*\*Bzzzt\**

Toshinori’s brow furrowed, pulling out his phone to find someone had texted him. As proven by tonight’s events, people didn’t really contact him this late unless it was important. He opened up the message, finding no contact information to be found.

**\[Unknown Number\]:** I need your friend to stay put. Hawks will come back, but leave him to me. 

Toshinori stared down at his phone, completely frozen as he read the words over and over again. He didn’t know what to do. His first question was how did she get this number, but he hadn’t actually changed his number since they had last seen each other. 

His second question was one he could answer himself. She was watching them. Toshinori turned back towards the balcony door, looking out across the cityscape, looking for even the slightest glint of a scope against the moonlight. As expected from her, he found nothing.

“Toshi?” Ryuko peered at him. “What is it?”

He just looked back down at his phone, his heart beating in his ears as he began to type.

**\[You\]:** Kaina? 

He waited, the world drowned out around him as he waited for a reply. For what felt like an eternity, there was nothing. That was, until…

**\[Unknown Number\]:** After all these years, everything I’ve done, do you still trust me?

He looked back up and out the glass door, knowing it was pointless to look for her. Knowing Kaina, she was too far away for the naked eye to even see. 

Toshinori turned around and raised his phone up for everyone else to see, his gaze still stuck on the distant rooftops. Ryuko shook her head, “Ah, shit…”

Hisashi took his glasses off, rubbing at his eye, “It just keeps getting better. Not sure I’m comfortable with how many people are apparently watching me now. But, I guess the main question is…Do you still trust her?”

Toshinori sighed, turning back to them, “...I do, but…I’m not gonna risk your life over this.”

Hisashi chuckled, “All Might, you know that I mean this with every ounce of admiration and respect…But, you kinda already have.”

“I-...Damn,” Toshinori clicked his tongue, realizing it was unfortunately true. 

“Hisashi…” Inko set down the suitcases, walking up to her husband, worry clear on her face. “You don’t have to do this.”

“I think I do,” Hisashi shrugged, but there was a clear nervous shake in his voice. “If acting as bait is what it takes to settle all this, then I’ll do it. If All Might trusts Ms. Tsutsumi, then so do I.”

“I’ll stay with him,” Ryuko cut in. “I’ll hide in the apartment. I’m already trying to come to terms with the fact that Hawks is some kind of assassin and my boyfriend’s ex was also an assassin. I might as well see if I can get some answers out of all this.”

Toshinori opened his mouth to say that Kaina wasn’t his ex, but he could see Inko shake her head, instantly signifying that it was a bad idea and he should keep his mouth shut. 

“I truly appreciate it, but you can’t,” Hisashi sighed. “Hawks has echolocation. He’ll know you’re in the apartment, and he’ll stay far away. The only way Ms. Tsutsumi can do her thing is if Hawks has his guard down. If she needs bait, I’ll be the bait.”

“Not without a plan,” Toshinori shook his head. “I have faith in Kaina, I do. But, I refuse to do this without all hands on deck. They started this, but we’re gonna finish it. You’ll stay at UA with me tonight, just to make sure he doesn’t try to pull anything until later.”

Toshinori pulled out his phone, sending another text back to Kaina.

  
  
  

***~...AMP…~***

  
  
  

Kaina gazed through her scope, watching from the shadows on a distant rooftop. She laid under the ventilation shafts connecting from the main unit into the building. The moon’s position in the sky against the roof exit made her spot nearly pitch black. 

She could see the green-haired woman take the suitcases away, everyone else beginning to talk again. Hopefully, that meant he was staying. She had been watching the other guy for a while, long enough to know he was an HPSC employee. 

She didn’t know how Toshinori knew him, but it really didn’t matter at this point. As much as her body wanted to reject the idea, if Toshinori trusted him to help her, so did she.

She looked down at the street, her brows raising at a familiar truck, “Holy shit, Toshi. You still drive Lady Liberty?”

*\*Bzzzt\**

Kaina looked down from her scope to her burner phone, seeing the new message on screen. “

**\[Toshinori\]:** Tomorrow. We’ll be ready.

“Oh Toshinori, you beautiful man.” Kaina retracted her rifle, standing up and looking around the rooftop. It was a decent size, and had to be about thirty meters or so across. It was a tall building, but not the tallest. It was surrounded by higher buildings, perfect for setting up recording equipment. “This’ll do just fine…”

**(****UA: Heights Alliance: First Floor Common Room****)**

  
  

Izuku was seriously regretting not watching “Aliens” until after Kyouka got One For All. 

He was pretty sure his ribs were broken.

They sat on pillows on the floor in front of the couch, Shoto to their right, and everyone else was on the couch. The credits rolled, with Kyouka shaking her head as she stared up at the ceiling,  “Why did I agree to this again?”

Izuku finally took a breath as Kyouka let go of his torso, “Because it’s not as scary as the first?”

“Yeah, that’s true. Honestly, after seeing shit like the nomu in real life, it’s not as scary anymore.”

“So, you’re open to watching more horror movies?”

“You shut your mouth,” Kyouka side-eyed him, her jacks poking his side. “Anybody wanna make me feel better about myself and admit they also don’t like scary movies?”

“I liked it a lot,” Ochako shrugged.

“...You’ve been hiding behind Momo for the last thirty minutes.”

From their position on the couch, she poked her head out from behind Momo’s shoulder, “Still liked it.”

Momo nodded her head, “I thought it was fantastic. I don’t watch too many films, so something like this is new to me. Especially a film centuries old. Although, I suppose Pride and Prejudice is also not from our century.”

Kyouka shivered at the memory of trying to watch that movie back when they were studying for midterms, “I’ll take the alien.”

“So, how was detention with Aizawa?” Tenya asked as he turned off the TV.

“Huh. I honestly thought you were doing your best to ignore the fact that your friends are a couple of troublemakers that got detention.”

“I’ll promptly go back to forgetting it after this.”

“Hmhmhm, of course. It’s honestly not too bad,” Kyouka shrugged, her head resting back against the crook of Izuku’s shoulder. “I think he understands that we weren’t the ones who started the fight, and Bakugou’s always been the one with the problem. It’s just a week of after-school training, plus today’s training and tomorrow, so we’re pretty tired. But, it’s a whole lot better than getting our licenses taken away or something.”

Ochako got out from behind Momo, beginning to stack some of their dishes together, “I can’t believe Bakugou can’t get his license until next year.”

“Well, what else was he expecting?” Tenya shrugged. “He’s already lucky that Mr. Aizawa didn’t expel him. It’s honestly more surprising that he didn’t.”

Shoto grunted a bit, picking up his own trash, “Just another example of him getting away with things.”

“Aw, c’mon. One fight shouldn’t mean expulsion,” Ochako said. 

“Maybe not, but I’ve seen what happens when someone is just allowed to treat people like garbage with no consequences. I almost did for a while.”

“You got another chance,” Izuku cut in, everyone turning to him. “Expulsion would probably just make him spiral further. Might as well give him one last shot to be better.”

“Mm…” Shoto sighed, standing up from the couch. “I guess in my experience, I’ve learned not to get my hopes up.”

“...Yeah, me too.” Izuku got up, beginning to take everyone’s dishes from the coffee table. “Thanks for joining us, guys. You can go ahead to your rooms, I’ve got all this.”

They tried to turn him down, but Izuku was persistent. The couple wished their friends goodnight, heading towards the kitchen. Once inside, Izuku set down the dishes on the kitchen island, moving around to the dishwasher. 

Both of their phones buzzed, and Kyouka checked her phone as Izuku had his hands full. “...Uh-oh.”

Izuku froze, the dishwasher door halfway down, “What?”

“From All Might; Come to my house on campus. Urgent.”

Izuku sighed, picking up the dishes, “This is escalating a lot quicker than expected.”

“They already sent an assassin to follow All Might,” Kyouka shrugged, helping Izuku put the dishes inside. “This escalated a long time ago.”

“Fair enough.” Izuku looked out of the window above the sink, the moon shining up above. “...Let’s go get changed. I’ll pull out journal ten.”

Kyouka closed the dishwasher, brow raised, “I’m assuming that’s the journal with Hawks’ entry in it?”

“Yeah. I got a feeling you might wanna start memorizing it.”

**(****Tokyo: HPSC Headquarters: Madam President’s Office****)**

  
  

Hawks felt like he had been staring at the doors to her office for an eternity. He really didn’t wanna walk in, he knew what was coming. 

*“Hawks…”*

As her voice came through the door, Keigo sighed, closing his eyes as he grabbed the door handle. He walked through, finding her sitting at her desk with the moon shining behind her, wine on the left as she signed papers as if business was continuing as usual. 

“Sit.”

Hawks’ legs seemed to move on their own, striding across the prussian blue floors, sitting down across from her. “We’re still in a stalemat-”

“No,” She cut him off, her eyes moving up from her papers, “We’re not. They have no intention of stopping, that point has been made quite clear. He believes himself invincible, standing behind All Might. As long as that is the case, they will do whatever they want, and we really will be doomed. He has to go.”

He held back his sigh, pressing his tongue to the back of his teeth as he stared at the edge of the desk. “What about his wife? She might know.”

“Then find out. If so, she has to go as well.”

He looked back up, gripping the armrests tightly, “They have a son.”

“He’s been at UA, I doubt he knows anything.”

“That’s not what I meant,” Hawks groaned as he stood up, pacing around the office. “You want me to kill the kid’s parents?”

“It will be staged like an accident.”

“Again, not the point.”

“Do you think I want this,” Madam President stood up, leaning both hands on her desk. “Do you think I wanted any of this? I know this isn’t what you’re used to, I’m not used to it either. This is the result of the last chairman, and we’re still picking up the mess he left behind.”

“Can’t we just explain that to the public?”

“It’s too late,” she shook her head, sighing as she stared down at the desk. “That option was only viable back at the initial murder of the chairman, condemning him, using him as our scapegoat. Now? We’ve kept the same secret for too long, and they’ll consider us guilty of the same crimes.”

Hawks grabbed the back of the chair, “And so we just double down and *actually* commit the same crimes?”

“Either they go down, or we go down and take Japan with us. We’ll be bled like a stuck pig in no time, and the League will take their opportunity to strike. Why do you think they broke Ms. Tsutsumi out? Why do you think they sent her on her little quest?”

“To get us off their back?”

“Or, to get rid of us entirely. Villains tend to search for more permanent solutions to their problems.”

“And, what you’re asking me to do isn’t a permanent solution?”

“Saying as we’ll still have All Might to deal with? No.”

Hawks dragged his hands down his face, taking a deep breath as he shook his head. “You gonna ask me to kill him too?”

“You know we can’t do that.”

*“...You say that now,”* Hawks mumbled.

“What was that?” Madam President asked sternly.

“Nothing,” Hawks sighed. 

She stood back up, walking back to the window, “...Will it be done?”

Hawks closed his eyes, biting down hard on the inside of his cheek, the metallic taste of blood already filling his mouth. 

“...Yes, ma’am.”

**(****Some Time Later: UA: All Might’s Housing Unit****)**

  
  
  

*\*Knock-Knock\**

The couple stood outside of All Might’s place, the night becoming a lot colder as the end of the year grew closer. Kyouka zipped up her (Izuku’s…So, hers) green jacket, her jacks perking up a bit. 

“Everyone’s inside.”

“Define everyone.”

“All Might, Aizawa, your mom and dad, and Pixie Bob.”

“...Yeah, this isn’t gonna be good.”

The door opened, Toshinori looking at his students with a sigh, “...Yeah, it’s not good.”

“What else is new?” Kyouka returned his sigh with her own, walking inside. They walked in, finding everyone sitting around Toshinori’s living room, overnight bags near the steps. “...Do I need to call my parents?”

Aizawa, who was sitting in the arm chair and staring up at the ceiling, cup of coffee dangling in from his hand, “Probably not the worst idea.”

Kyouka hummed, leaning down to hug Inko, “You okay.”

She returned the hug, shaking her head, “By our definition of okay, I suppose I am.”

“So, not at all.” Kyouka stood back up, nodding at Hisashi sitting next to his wife. “Hey, sir.”

“Great to see you again, Jirou,” he smiled at her. “Sorry for dragging you into this.”

Kyouka scoffed, “Trust me, sir. I’ll be saying that a whole lot more than you in the future.”

“Hey, mom. Dad.” Izuku hugged his mom, looking over to his dad, nodding over to All Might. “Looks like your dream is coming true.”

Hisashi chuckled, “Not exactly how I pictured it, but I guess I can't be too picky.”

“Okay, we’re all here,” All Might said, moving to stand in front of the TV. “Young Midoriya, Young Jirou, I know this is all a bit confusing, bu-”

“Don’t worry, we read everything in your messages,” Kyouka cut him off. 

Toshinori furrowed his brow in confusion, but Izuku continued, “Yeah, it was definitely a shock, but learning about government assassins is unfortunately on the lower end of crazy things in our life.”

“I…Yes,” Toshinori quickly caught on, playing along. “Forgive the wall of text, but I figured I would save everyone time, rather than going over the entire story again here.”

Hisashi looked at the couple, brows raised, “You two are taking a battle between government assassins extremely well.”

The couple looked at each other, both shrugging as Kyouka replied, “Pretty par for the course around here. At this point, we’re just happy we weren’t directly involved this time…Until now, that is.”

“I’m not sure you’ll be so lax once you hear the plan,” Toshinori sighed. “Kaina reached out to me. It seems Hawks wasn’t the only one watching us. She knows that Hawks will come back for Mr. Midoriya…and she wants us to use him as bait.”

The couple was silent, with Kyouka slowly turning towards Izuku, who was staring right through Toshinori, tongue pressed under his bottom lip. “...I’m sorry?”

“Hawks won’t come back until he can get your father alone. If we want to end this now, give Kaina the chance she needs to complete her plan, then…”

“I…” Izuku clicked his teeth together, taking a deep breath. “...I am my father’s son, and knowing myself, that means he’s already agreed to this and will not be convinced otherwise.”

Hisashi shifted his eyes around, clearing his throat, “...Yeah.”

“...I now know what it feels like to be Kyouka and my mom.”

Kyouka pursed her lips and nodded, “The unfortunate part is we both knew what we were signing up for.”

“Dad, you really don’t have to do this,” Izuku shook his head, concern etched into his features. “It’s not that I believe Ms. Tsutsumi would let you get hurt, but Hawks is the number two hero for a reason. Something could very easily go wrong.”

“I know. Believe me, I do. But, I trust All Might. And…I trust you.” Izuku’s brows knit together at his father’s words, Hisashi smiling up at him. “I’ve seen you in action. I know what you did at camp, I know you fought the Hero Killer, and that was when you were first starting out. I feel a whole lot better knowing I’ve got you in my corner.”

That was…

Izuku didn’t know. He couldn’t remember the last time he had heard something like that from his father. He had always been supportive in the times that they did speak, even when it grew rarer over the years. But, not just hearing he had faith in him, but that he trusted his son to protect him with his life…

“...God-damn it. Okay, what are we doing?”

“We’re splitting up into teams,” Ryuko answered. “By the way, you two could’ve mentioned the crazy, assassin ex-girlfriend when giving me his number.”

Aizawa snapped his head up, glaring at the Problem Children, “You did *what?”*

“Stay focused, Mr. Aizawa!” Kyouka quickly changed the topic. “Crazy assassins! Government bullshit! Anyway, All Might, please continue.”

“You guys had All Might’s number?” Hisashi looked at them, brow furrowed. 

“Anyway!” Kyouka continued to push the conversation along. “Mr. Midoriya has to be alone. Hawks will know if someone is in the apartment.”

“Echolocation,” Izuku and Hisashi said simultaneously, both then glancing at each other. 

“Exactly,” Toshinori nodded. “Young Midoriya and Jirou, you’ll be with Aizawa protecting Mrs. Midoriya in case she’s a target too. You’ll be near, but not too close to the apartment building where Hawk’s will see you. Ryuko and I will be driving around the block. Odds are Hawks has seen my truck, so we’ll take Aizawa’s car.”

Shouta looked up from his coffee, deadpanning at Toshinori, “Of course, I’m happy to offer up my car without any previous knowledge of that being the plan.”

“You know I’ll pay for any damages.” 

Aizawa merely grumbled in response, sitting up in his chair and turning to his students, “Hawks is *very* fast, and based on Lady Nagant’s entire shtick, she’ll most likely attack from far away. You two are the only ones with the speed to even slightly keep up. Pixie Bob and I are relying on you to inform us on where Hawks goes. Wherever he and Lady Nagant decide to face off, we’ll need to get there quickly. I’m sure Ms. Tsutsumi is more than capable, but Hawks is a different beast.”

The couple glanced at one another, both already what would likely end up happening. Izuku turned to his teacher with a sigh, “Mr. Aizawa, I know you’re going to object, but we-”

“You’re going to fight anyway. Yeah, I know,” Shouta leaned forward in his seat, looking at them with a steely gaze in his eyes. “You two have your licenses now. Provisional or not, I expect nothing less than for you to do your jobs. All you two have ever done is punch way above your weight class. This is no different, you do what you’ve always done. You do your absolute best, you think smarter and faster than your opponent. Above all else, you protect one another, and you fight as one. Nobody can read each other’s minds like you two walking tornados, so use that to your advantage. Once Pixie Bob and I get there, the fight will be over. Hawks won’t stand a chance. I’m not asking you to defeat him, but I’m expecting you to give him Hell all the same.”

The couple nodded, once again surprised by their teacher’s ability to give inspirational speeches. Despite happening quite a few times now, it just wasn’t expected from his typical behavior. They both answered simultaneously, “Yes, sir.”

“Tomorrow you’re gonna go get your suits from school, I’ll worry about the release forms.”

“Alright,” Toshinori nodded, looking around at everyone. “I think that’s everything for now. We’ll figure out more when things come down to the wire.”

“Acutally, here’s one more thing…” Izuku turned back to All Might, brow furrowed. “What happens if the League show up? Our running theory is that they’re the ones that broke her out.”

“Then, we’ll have to deal with them.”

“...What if she still wants to go with them?”

“...She won’t,” Toshinori shook his head, looking down at the floor. “She had to have joined them as a means to an end. Nothing more.”

“But-”

“She won’t,” Toshinori looked up at his protege, her voice firm. “I know her. She won’t.”

Izuku sighed, but relented with a nod of his head, “I understand.” 

Toshinori closed his eyes and took a deep breath. He looked back up at his assembled team, determination in his eyes, “If the League does show up, leave Shigaraki to me. A conversation between me and him has been long overdue. Just focus on Hawks. Saving Kaina is our top priority….Tomorrow, we clip his wings.”

  
  
  
  
  

***~...AMP…~***

  
  
  

**(****Next Morning: Ground Beta****)**

  
  

From a bird’s eye view, one would see two streaks of light rushing through the streets of the faux city. 

They weren’t going particularly fast, keeping Kyouka at her low percentages, but they were going about the speed of cars on the highway. Izuku still wasn’t particularly comfortable full-on sparring with Kyouka quite yet. 

It wasn’t a question of whether or not he could handle it. She was more than capable, she had proven that time and time again. Izuku just wasn’t a fan of attacking the people he loved, even if just a spar.

But, he knew he’d have to get over it sooner rather than later. Kyouka needed proper training, and she wouldn’t get that if he was too soft. 

…Kyouka, however, didn’t seem to share the same problem he did.

Izuku slid to a stop in front of the moving truck, moving his head to the right as Kyouka barreled at him and punched the truck, a huge dent being formed in the metal as the truck rocked to the side.

“Ow! That…” Kyouka looked down at her hand in astonishment. “That didn’t hurt.”

Izuku grabbed her arm, sliding his foot behind hers, spinning Kyouka around and lightly pushing her down the road, her feet sliding against the concrete. “You’re still as surprised as when you first got these powers.”

“You act like it’s easy to get used to.”

“Hmhm, I know. Should I be worried about how badly you want to hit me?”

“I don’t want to hit you,” Kyouka rushed forward again, throwing an uppercut that Izuku dodged. “I just know that I can’t. You’re like three-times faster than me.”

“Fair point.” With every word, Kyouka threw jabs, each of which Izuku dodged. Izuku kept his hands near his sides, weaving left and right to avoid Kyouka’s attacks, flipping back as her jacks tried to sweep his legs out from under him. 

Kyouka took the chance to stab her jacks into the road, vibrations pulsing down the street, shaking the area and cracking the ground beneath them. It caused Izuku to lose his balance when landing, wobbling a bit to regain his footing. 

Seizing her opportunity, Kyouka rocketed forward in a burst of violet light for a drop kick. 

Still being much faster, Izuku brought his arms up, blocking the kick. But, while he stayed standing, it still sent him sliding across the asphalt, dust clouds around his shoes. 

He smiled brightly at Kyouka, “That was great! You’re really getting the hang of this.”

Kyouka chuckled, a little out of breath, trying to keep her rhythm as she bounced on her feet, “As cliche as it is to say, it really does help that I have a good teacher.”

Izuku smiled back, cyan sparks dancing around him, “Then let’s review mobility. C’mon!”

Izuku ran off, Kyouka not far behind him. She followed Izuku through the streets of Ground Beta, following his movements as he curved into an alley. They hopped up onto the walls, bouncing back and forth against the buildings at breakneck speeds, going up higher until Izuku began to sprint up the skyscraper.

“Don’t think about it too hard!” Izuku called back to her. “Just keep your momentum, and you’ll go up!”

Kyouka internally sighed to herself, breaking into a full sprint once her foot hit the building, rocketing up the side. She was doing fine up until her eyes darted to the right, realizing how high up she was, causing her to falter.

“Whoa!” Kyouka reached up, grabbing the edge of the roof, instantly regretting looking down at the street below. She felt Izuku grab her arm, hoisting her up easily, holding her close. Kyouka blushed, her jacks clinking together, “...I might’ve thought about it too hard.”

“That’s okay,” Izuku chuckled. “I didn’t get it my first try either.”

“When was that?” Kyouka asked as they moved over to the edge of the building, sitting down with their feet hanging over the edge. 

“Gran Torino’s. I wanted to train up on the roof, because fighting in his apartment was, uh…Not ideal.”

“I’m still dreading the day that we tell him about all this. I’m already sick of explaining the whole shared stockpile thing.”

“We’re gonna have to get used to it. There’s him, there’s Nighteye…eventually. There’s my dad…”

“And, when’s that last one gonna be?”

Izuku blew a raspberry, shaking his head, “Throwing One For All on top of all this stuff with Lady Nagant and his own employers? It’d probably be better to keep waiting on that.”

“It’d be a lot, yeah. But, if things really do go bad tonight and we have to fight, I’m gonna fight. He might see some things. It's gonna be hard to explain the purple lightning.”

Izuku scoffed, “It’s gonna be hard to explain the purple lightning to Hawks.”

“Bah, he’s an assassin who knows nothing about my quirk. He doesn’t know what I can do. Who’s gonna believe him? His Tartarus inmates?”

“Mhmhm, fair point. But, maybe he’s like Lady Nagant. Maybe he was tricked into doing all this, or blackmailed.”

Kyouka sighed, resting her head on his shoulder, “Optimistic as ever. Unfortunately, him coming to his senses wouldn’t bring back everyone he’s probably killed.”

“Yeah, but…It didn’t for Lady Nagant either.” 

“Mm, I know. I’m not sure how that’s gonna go. Do you think she’ll actually stick around to testify? I don’t think she’ll go back to prison willingly.”

Izuku hummed, shaking his head, “I think that’s the part we’re gonna have to leave up to All Might.”

“And, if the League shows up? Supposedly that’s who broke her out.” Izuku didn’t even have a proper answer for that one. He just groaned, his shoulders slumping. “Hahaha! Don’t think about it too hard, handsome.”

“Thinking about things too hard is my specialty.”

“I know,” Kyouka chuckled, kissing his cheek. She checked her phone, looking at the time as she stood up. “We should probably go and get our costumes; savor the hours of peace we have left today.”

“Yeah,” Izuku nodded, standing up too. He furrowed his brow as Kyouka started walking towards the roof access door. “What are you doing?”

Kyouka turned back, brow raised, “Going back down?”

Izuku smiled, chuckling in realization. “It’ll take you a while to remember that falls from heights don’t really mean anything to you anymore.” 

Izuku fell backwards over the edge, the wind rushing past him as he plummeted to the ground. As he got closer to the bottom, he lightly kicked off the wall and rolled. He brushed himself off as he stood back up, looking back up towards the top to a very unamused Kyouka.

“I’m very happy you’re moving past it, but I personally would very much like a warning before you jump off of buildings!”

Izuku cringed, clearing his throat, “S-Sorry! You don’t have to do the kick off thing, but it’s better for your knees!”

Kyouka sighed, shaking her head as she stared down at the streets below. “This is stupid. This is so damn stupid.”

She took a deep breath, exhaling as she leaned forward and off the rooftop. It had to be a seven-story building, but her brain was trying to ignore that, even when the road was barreling towards her.

She flipped forward, kicking off of the building. Once she hit the ground, she rolled, standing up right into Izuku. He stumbled back, holding them both in place. 

Izuku smiled, “You okay?”

“Welp, my heart’s pounding, my legs are wobbling, and it feels like my stomach is still up on the roof…So, yeah.”

“Mhmhm, like I said, you’ll get used to it. C’mon…” Izuku kneeled down in front of her, waiting for Kyouka to hop on. “It’s been too long since we’ve done this.”

“Last time was at camp, so I don’t wanna count that one since it was during a time of…You know, horror.” Kyouka hopped on, wrapping her arms around Izuku’s shoulders as he hooked his arms under her legs. They began to journey back to the dorms, heading for the main gate to Ground Beta. “Hey, I know you’re always nice, and I’m your girlfriend, and the love of your life, and the greatest thing to ever happen to you-”

“Mhm, all true. Continue.”

Kyouka chuckled, “I’m just wondering…Am I really doing okay? With One For All, and all that…”

“Kyouka, you’re doing amazing. You’ve got it a lot easier than I did at the start.”

“Yeah, but that’s only because I have you to make sure I don’t make the same mistakes.”

“So? That’s my job.”

“I guess. I dunno. I’m not like…cramping your style, or anything?”

“Cramping my style?”

“You know, holding you back or something? I don’t wanna hinder your progress with all the attention you’ve been giving me.”

Izuku turned his head, his face near Kyouka’s as she rested her chin on his shoulder, “Not at all. Honestly, it’s been great having an actual training partner. If anything, you’re helping me more than if you weren’t a part of One For All.”

Kyouka smiled, kissing his temple, “Thanks. Just feel like I’ve got a lot to live up to, is all.”

“Mm, join the club.”

“Hmhmhm. Fair point.”

**(****Unknown Musutafu Apartment****)**

  
  

Twice set two duffel bags down on Kaina’s floor, Tomura walking in behind him through the portal. Tomura nudged the bag with his foot, calling out to Kaina, “Delivery for a shit-load of recording equipment.”

The bathroom door opened up, Kaina stepping out in a long, sleeveless, dark purple dress, her belt and grappling lines secured around her lower abdomen, and her wrist launcher on her left arm. 

Kaina walked over the bags, crouching down and unzipping them, checking everything over. Handheld cameras, tripods, network boosters, attachable wall cameras, parabolic microphone attachments; the works. “All of these can wirelessly stream?”  
  

Twice saluted, “Sure can! **How am I supposed to know?!**”

Kaina zipped up the duffel bags, nodding her head, “Thanks.”

“No problem,” Tomura nodded, pocketing his hands. “Is it safe to assume this is it?”

Kaina looked at him, brow raised, “Meaning?”

“Meaning it looks like you’re gearing up for something big; something you need visual proof of. If this is what you’ve been working towards…What are the odds you come back from this?”

Kaina scoffed, throwing both bags over her shoulder, “Might’ve been outta the game for a while, but I haven’t lost my touch.”

Tomura rolled his eyes a bit, turning to Twice and nodding back towards the portal, “You can go back now, buddy. Thanks.”

“You got it, boss! **I don’t wanna go!”** Twice turned around, diving straight through the dark vortex. 

Now alone, Tomura turned back to Kaina, “Now that I’m the only one here to witness the fall of your pride, you know what I meant.”

Kaina bit the inside of her cheek, sighing as she scratched the back of her head, “...Dunno. Doesn’t matter though. Whether I live or die was never really a factor, as long as the job gets done. I’m not going back to Tartarus.”

“And, if you live, you’re not coming back here?”

Kaina looked around, taking one last look at her little apartment; the simple, yet perfect taste of freedom. “...No. Our little deal was so I could expose the HPSC. Otherwise, I want no association with you and your group. No offense, but no matter what you or others may think of me, I’m no villain. Never gonna be.”

“I get it,” Tomura nodded. “You need anything else from me?”

“No, but…Thanks, I guess. For getting me out, I mean.” Kaina gripped the straps of the bags, looking back at Tomura. “Might not agree with you on things, and what I did might indirectly help you hide, but…I don’t know. I don’t think you’re hopeless.”

Tomura chuckled, shaking his head, “What a glowing review. I keep hearing that, but if you think that, then you don’t know me. You know where you’re going?”

“Yeah, same place as last time.” A portal suddenly swirled open behind her, Kaina turning around and staring into the void. She sighed, looking back at Tomura, “...See ya around, kid.”

Kaina stepped through the portal, her deal with the League officially ending. The portal vanished, leaving Tomura alone in the apartment. He sighed, removing his hand from his face, “Guess that’s it then…Kurogiri?”

From the portal behind him, Kurogiri stepped through, “Yes, Young Tomura?”

“Giran put a tracker in one of the cameras, right?”

Kurogiri held back a sigh, knowing where this was all leading, “Yes, he did. Are you certain you want to follow it?”

“She said it herself, she’d rather die than go back to Tartarus.” Tomura looked back at him over his shoulder, placing the hand back on his face, “I guess I’m just feeling generous today.”

  
  
  
  

***~...AMP…~***

  
  
  

**(****Many Hours Later: Night: Midoriya Family Apartment****)**

  
  

Hisashi moved the curtain away from his balcony door, looking out into the Musutafu cityscape. The moon shone brightly above, thousands of city lights underneath it.

He moved away from the door, leaning back against the couch. No matter how many deep breaths he took, he couldn’t get his heart rate down. Usually whenever he was on a case, he was the guy watching the cameras, waiting in the surveillance van. 

Now, despite technically having a team, he was alone. 

But, he’d be fine. If Lady Nagant was watching, she’d be in direct line of sight to the balcony. She shot before Hawks ever even stepped inside. He just needed to be patient. 

*“Mr. Midoriya, are you alright?”*

Hisashi sighed as All Might’s voice came through, readjusting his earpiece, “Define alright.”

  
  
  

***~...AMP…~***

**(****Nearby Street**)

  
  

“Fair enough,” Toshinori sighed, making a left as he drove aimlessly throughout the neighborhood, Ryuko in the passenger seat next to him. “AMP, are you ready?”

*“Define ready.”*

  
  

***~...AMP…~***

**(****Deku Park****)**

  
  

“Also,” Kyouka continued over the call, “I understand we’re supposed to look conspicuous, but my boyfriend looks like he’s sitting on another kid’s shoulders to sneak into the movies.”

As Inko chuckled, Izuku snapped his head towards Kyouka, taking off the trench coat he borrowed from All Might, his hero suit underneath, “Not all of us have costumes that are just a jacket and pants.”

“We drove here, dingus. Nobody would’ve seen you. You look like a flasher.”

“Why did I get assigned to the Problem Children again?” Aizawa deadpanned from his position on the park bench. “Ju-...Does that sign say Deku Park?”

Near where Toshinori’s truck was parked, a fairly recent street sign was placed with the park’s new name presented for everyone to see.

“Long story,” the couple answered simultaneously. 

Izuku set his duffel bag onto the park bench, taking out and securing his pauldrons on his shoulder, “Any word from Lady Nagant since last night?”

*“No,”* Toshinori replied dejectedly. *“Probably a burner phone she already broke. I can’t send messages to that number anymore.”*

“Going off faith,” Kyouka smiled, oozing sarcasm. “My favorite.”

*“Hey, after all the bullshit with you two this year, you owe us to follow one sketchy plan.”*

“Ugh, fine.”

*“Just keep your ears open, Young Jirou.”*

Kyouka saluted, “Listening for any really giant birds.”

Hisashi suddenly came through over the line, *“Your quirk really makes your hearing that strong?”*

“Well, if I’m listening in the right direction, honing in on the right distance…Are you tapping your foot right now?”

*“...How the hell?”*

“I’m just kidding, I heard it over the phone.”

*“O-Oh, right. Yeah, hehe.”*

“I’d say not to be nervous Mr. Midoriya, but that would be incredibly hypocritical of me. Just know we’ve got your back.”

*“Phew…Yeah. Yeah, okay. Thank you.”*

Izuku pointed at his own earpiece, signaling for Kyouka to mute hers. Once she did, Izuku readjusted his gauntlets, his armor plating fully on, and asked, “Were you really joking, or did you actually hear him tapping his foot all the way from here?”

Kyouka just smirked at him, “Wouldn’t you like to know?”

  
  
  

***~...AMP…~***

  
  

**(****Midoriya Family Apartment****)**

  
  

Hisashi took a deep breath, standing up from the couch and walking towards the kitchen. Was drinking probably the smartest choice right now? Absolutely not, but he didn’t see anyone else volunteering to act as bait for an assassin. 

Walking around the kitchen island, he opened up the top cabinet and pulled out a small glass and a bottle of whiskey.

“Evening.” Hisashi jumped in surprise, swiveling around to see Hawks in his front foyer, shutting the door behind him. “Sorry. I promised your wife I’d use the front door next time.”

Five voices rang out from Hisashi’s earpiece, all with a collective, *“Shit.” / “Shit.” / “Shit.” / “Shit.” / “Shit.”* 

He could hear everyone start rushing around, the plan already taking a sharp left turn. Hisashi didn’t say anything, just standing there with his glass and bottle in hand. He wasn’t on the balcony. He was supposed to come through the balcony. He wasn’t visible, Nagant had no shot. 

Hawks also didn’t particularly look…happy. 

His typical relaxed and snarky behavior was gone, he had no smirk on his face. He seemed sad, if anything. 

*‘Just walk forward. For the love of all that’s holy, walk forward.’*

Hawks did in fact walk forward, but only made it past the foyer, still not in sight of the balcony door. “You know why I’m here, I take it?”

“...Yeah. I’m more confused as to why you’re announcing it.”

“Cause I don’t wanna do this,” Hawks sighed, a feather floating out from his wing and landing in his palm. “But, I figured the least I could do is let you get any last affairs in order. I can’t let you leave any notes or anything like that, you could leave a hidden message or something. But, mementos, money, stuff like that.”

Hisashi looked down at his glass, clearing his throat, “...How about one last drink?”

“I can get behind that,” Hawks chuckled, nodding his head. Hisashi walked around the island and stepped in front of the archway into the hall, directly across from the balcony door. If Lady Nagant was watching, she had to see he was speaking to someone. “You know, don’t think I’ve ever seen someone so calm during these moments.”

“Ah…Cause I know they’ll be alright. My family, they’ve…they’ve done just fine without me. My wife’s definitely put up with me for long enough. And, my son? He’s the strongest person I know, and he sure as shit didn’t inherit that from me. I thought I was doing the right thing my whole life, working for the HPSC. I thought I was really helping people, and that’s not to say that I didn’t. But…then, I look at people like you. I realized it’d be better finally acting like a hero, like my kid, than to be an ignorant slave.”

“...Well, damn. Ouch.”

“Sorry, but it’s true. I just hope this makes him proud.” Hisashi tilted his head back, downing his glass in one swig. Hawks made his feather sharpen, taking a step forward towards Hisashi. But, Hawks stopped, peering at Hisashi as his chest and throat began to glow orange. 

“Ah, come the fuck o-”

***\*FWOOOSH!!!\****

Hawks covered himself with his wings as billowing flames exploded from Hisashi’s mouth, pushing Hawks back to the front door. The heat died down quickly, Hawks growling as he lowered his wings, patting down little fires on his feathers. He looked up, finding scorch marks and little flames covering the living room…

…And, Hisashi was gone.

“You just had to make this more difficult than it already was, man! Hawks slid to a stop in front of the hallway, the moonlight from the balcony door shining against his red wings. 

…There it is.

Hawks’ feathers ruffled, the vibrations in the air shifting as he felt something small approaching, like a speeding bulle-...

“...Ah, shi-”

A bullet crashed through the balcony door, piercing through the air and slamming directly into Hawks’ back, sending him down the hall and crashing into the wall. With a pained groan and a loud crack in his shoulders, he managed to stand back up. He turned around, cursing under his breath, his eyes locking on a little pink and indigo ball rolling down the hall and stopping directly at his feet. 

*“Hawks?”* Madam President came in over his earpiece. *“Hawks, what was that noise?”*

“It’s her. Fuck, I think she broke a rib or something.”

*“Don’t let her get away.”*

“What abou-”

*“You can deal with Midoriya later. Lady Nagant. Right. Now.”*

Hawks furrowed his brow, wings extending out in front of him. With one strong movement, he launched himself down the hall and out the balcony door in blinding speeds, soaring off into the night sky. 

From the door, directly next to where Hawks had been standing, Hisashi very slowly peeked out from behind the door. He fully opened the door and looked around, finding the coast clear. He slumped against the wall, holding his pounding heart.

“Oh, fuck…” Hisashi chuckled, a huge wave of relief washing over him. He looked up, seeing a glow from down the hall. But, it wasn’t the moon. It looked yellow, or orange. “...Oh, fuck.”

Hisashi rushed down the hall, seeing half of his living room on fire. He dived over the kitchen counter, grabbing the fire extinguisher from under the counter. He pulled the pin and sprayed down everything he could. 

“Dad!” Hisashi swiveled around, seeing Izuku and Kyouka barrel through the balcony door, their hero costumes on. “Are you okay?”

“I’m fine! Don’t worry about me, you need to find where Hawks went. Be careful, okay?”

“Right,” Izuku nodded, his expression switching from concerned to determined. “C’mon!” 

Izuku and Kyouka ran back out to the balcony, leaping off of the ledge, bouncing across the rooftops in streaks of cyan and violet.

Hisashi picked the nozzle to the extinguisher back up, pointing at the remaining fire an-...

He spun back around, eyes wide like saucers as he stared at the couple trailing across the cityscape.

*“Mr. Midoriya, are you there?”* Toshinori’s voice came through his earpiece. *“Are you alright? Did AMP make it to you?”*

“Y-...Yeah, I’m alright. They just went after him.”

He heard Toshinori sigh in relief, the engine to Aizawa’s car roaring as he sped down the street, *“Okay, perfect. You need to head down to the park and meet your wife there. Stay on the line, we’ll handle the rest.”*

“Yeah. Yeah, um…I’m sorry, but-...Am I crazy or did Jirou just have super speed...and lightning like my son’s…and did she just leap fifty-meters?”

*“...Would you believe me if I said you were crazy?”*

  
  
  

***~...AMP…~***

  
  

**(****Edge of Musutafu Suburban Area****)**

  
  

Hawks soared across the neighborhoods, Midoriya’s apartment now far behind him. He was just entering the more urban zone of the city. Buildings were growing higher, and far more packed together. 

He had to be careful. The urban jungle was where Nagant thrived. He would have to send out feathers to search for her. 

She could be anywhere.

…Like, right in front of him.

Hawks furrowed his brow, seeing Lady Nagant standing at the edge of a skyscraper, her dress flowing in the wind and her rifle extended out from her arm. 

“Oh, this can’t be good…”

He flew up higher, spreading his wings out to slow himself down. Once he stopped, Hawks looked down at Lady Nagant as she stood in the center of the rooftop. They were on the outskirts of the main city area, but the building was fairly tall, the parked cars below like little bugs from his perspective. 

She had ammo belts around her waist and strapped to her arms, each loaded with pink and indigo swirled bullets. 

“First of all…” Hawks jabbed his thumb back over his shoulder, pointing at his back, “Ow. Second of all, I have a strong feeling you’ve been waiting for me.”

“Whatever could’ve given you that impression?” Kaina deadpanned up at him. 

“Mm. Any chance you could see reason and surrender peacefully?”

“We both know your boss would never allow that. Not anymore.” Kaina shook her head, casually pacing across the roof. “And, I’m clearly not the one that needs to see reason.”

“Mass panic is your definition of reason.”

Kaina scoffed, shaking her head, “They told me the same thing too. Told me they had great plans for me. Told me I was taking down people who posed great threats to the country. Told me that I was the last defense for keeping everyone happy, and at peace. It didn’t take me long to realize how bullshit that was…But, my first bullet was already fired. They had me. They wouldn’t let me quit. I was too ashamed to tell-...Doesn’t matter now. I had a chance, but I was too late. But, you? I remember you…You were just a little boy. They sunk their claws into you early, brainwashed you. You never even had a real chance.”

Hawks sighed, shaking his head, “You don’t know me.”

“Yes, I do. You weren’t the first…” The image of Toga flashed in Kaina’s mind. “...You weren’t the last. But, no more. No. More.”

“...You really were wrong for the job. You couldn’t handle the difficult choices we have to make. People need me, whether they know about it or not. I’ll save them from the nightmares before they even have them. I may not like some of the things I have to do, but it serves a purpose. *I* have a purpose.”

“Yes, you do have a purpose. You cover the asses of the corrupt politicians who want to protect their bottom line.”

“I protect everyone…” Hawks scowled, pointing at himself, “I would rather bare all of these burdens on my shoulders, than have anyone feel scared, alone, and unprotected.”

“It’s good that you see it that way,” Kaina stopped pacing, looking up at Hawks again. “It means there’s hope for you. Tell me…Did you think your job would involve murdering an innocent man and his wife to cover up the HPSC’s dirty work?”

“...”

“Do you think it’ll stop there? If you kill him, you’ll break the dam. You do it once, they’ll expect it from you again. It’ll snowball, and eventually you won’t be able to sleep at night. You won’t recognize yourself in the mirror. You did this for purpose? Whose? Yours or theirs? I know they kicked things up a notch after my fiasco. How much of your life do they control? Do you even have a life?”

“...”

Kaina retracted her rifle, her expression finally softening, “...Help me. Help *All Might*. Testify against them, cut a deal. The people love you, they’ll understand. If you truly want to help people, free them from the illusion. They might be scared at first, sure. But, it’s the only way to give them actual leaders they can trust. They’ll feel safer knowing they’re not putting their trust in the hands of murderers who are only interested in keeping the status quo for their own benefit.”

“...All Might,” Hawks pressed his tongue against his back teeth, peering down at Kaina. “...You set him after us. You knew…”

Kaina closed her eyes, her face returning to her cold demeanor as sighed, gazing back up at him. “...I knew Toshinori wouldn’t go at it alone. You would never touch him, but you would go after whoever he was with. Honestly, I expected to watch over Torino or Nighteye, but one of your own? Now, that was certainly unexpected. Man, you guys just can’t seem to stop having your own employees turn on you. Sorry if I set a precedent.” 

“...You wanted us to know you escaped, and you wanted us to follow All Might.”

“Cause I knew Toshinori would instantly jump at the chance to help me, no matter what. You think your bosses are scared of me? I’m assuming the instant they heard All Might was going after them, they shit their pants. They’d pull out the big guns. AKA…You.”

Hawks chuckled again, sighing as he pocketed his hands, “Gotta admit, you played us. But, what now? You try to convince me to testify, and…If I say no?”

Kaina smiled, shrugging her shoulders, “Already took care of that.”

She nodded over her shoulder, and Hawks looked past her to see a slight glint in the shadows next to the roof access. There was also a small, blinking red dot.

“...You’ve gotta be shitting me?” Hawks scowled.

“What was that?” Kaina raised a brow, reaching into her belt and pulling out a little mic wired to her body. “Speak into the microphone, please?”

Hawks fired out a feather, careening right into the camera, destroying  it instantly. 

Kaina clicked her tongue, shaking her head, “Damn it…If only I hadn’t set up and hidden multiple cameras surrounding the building, all with parabolic mics.”

“...”

“Oh, and even if you destroy them, they’ve been livestreaming directly to my apartment. Which, I should also mention, the address was put into a scheduled message to All Might’s number.”

  
“...”

“...Is this the part where we fight now?”

*\*SHING!!!\**

Hawks threw his wings out, feathers launching right for Kaina. Her rifle extending out of her arm, Kaina’s barrel expanded rapidly, her bullet firing out with a crack as she set air pressure in her rifle to its max. The bullet shot out, blowing through one of Hawks’ feathers and sending most of the others flying off course. 

Hawks just barely managed to cover his body with his wings, the impact still knocking him back, grunting as a sickening crunch could be heard in his left wing. He fell back off the building, the rest of his feathers still aimed right at Kaina.

Kaina flipped back, the feathers zooming past her and impaling the AC unit. She took one of her bullets from her belt and reloaded, her eyes widening as she heard the creak of metal behind her. The feathers pulled themselves free from the AC unit, zipping past her and over the edge of the building. 

Hawks suddenly shot up from the other side of the building, soaring up high and throwing his wings out, another hail of feathers coming her way. Kaina quickly hit the button on her belt, the grappling hooks at her waist firing back and stabbing themselves in the concrete at the edge. 

She was yanked back, the feathers curving right before they hit the roof, continuing their path towards her. Kaina grabbed onto the lines, pulling her back and over the edge of the building, retracting her hooks back to her belt as she plummeted down. 

Appearing over the edge, Hawks’ feathers returned to their place in his wings, spreading out wide, his body arching back before he shot himself down at Kaina, a crack in the air as the sound barrier was broken in an instant.

Now halfway down the skyscraper, Kaina aimed her rifle up at Hawks, her rifle barrel expanding to its max once again. She fired, a crack in the air mimicking Hawks’ own.

The windows trailing behind Hawks all shattered as he flew past them, the same happening with Kaina’s bullet. 

Hawks curled his wings around himself, doing a barrel roll to dodge Kaina’s bullet as it soared into the sky, parting a small hole in the clouds with it. As he spun, more feathers fired out like a machine gun. 

Kaina grabbed onto her grappling lines, using them to change her trajectory and crashing through the windows of the building, Hawks and his feathers just barely rocketing past her. But, the shockwave still hit her, knocking her further into what seemed like a marketing office, her body tumbling over a conference table and crashing into a display board on an easel, mini shards of glass leaving small cuts on her body. 

She grunted as she got up, moving over to the exit and kicking it open, “No, no, no. Let’s get you back in the spotlight, Tweetie Bird.”

She left the room, with Hawks coming through the window shortly after. He grumbled, his wing smacking the table aside as he walked towards the door. Stepping through, he found himself in an open office, maybe thirty-meters across. There were groups of desks, all with computers and tablets. There was artwork on the walls, ads probably made by this company. The far left wall had tall windows, allowing the moonlight to shine through. There were other hallways, probably to other offices and bathrooms, not to mention exits. 

“Hm…” He pulled two feathers out, both sharpening into blades as a handful of other feathers floated out, pointing out in front of him. They shook, all pointing far to the left to the rows of desks near the windows.

Hawks moved his eyes over, pinpointing which desk she was hiding under. He started moving, completely silent. His feathers slowly floated over to the desk, stopping just above, pointing down and ready to strike. 

Under the desk, Kaina watched the reflection of Hawks in the glass. She could see him slowly circling the office, his footsteps not making a sound. His feathers were just too oppressive. She just needed a lot of noise. 

She watched him move, looking at where he was heading. Kaina flicked over eyes at the corner of the office, her shot already lined up. 

Kaina extended out her rifle, firing at the metal support beams between the windows. She dived to the right, the feathers stabbing down through the desk and into the floor where she had been hiding, but not without one catching her left shoulder. 

Her bullet ricocheted against the support beams, it’s trajectory switching and slamming into Hawks’ shoulder, knocking him back against a desk, the monitor falling onto the floor. 

Kaina got up, holding the cut on her shoulder, blood slowly going down her arm. Hawks got up, his shoulder cracking as he rolled it. “Fuckin’ hell, lady. I know you’ve been out of the game for a while, but you know the bullets are supposed to pierce the body, not break it.”

He threw his wing out, more feather shooting out at Kaina as she dived over more desks, reloading her rifle with more soft bullets. “My days of killing are over. Yours should be too.”

“They would be, if you just made this easy for me,” Hawks growled as his feathers floated up, firing again at Kaina. She used her wrist grapple to hook a rolling chair behind her, swinging it widely and hitting the feathers, knocking them out of the air. “All of this started, because of you!” 

Hawks’ wing slammed into a desk, knocking it into air towards Kaina. She dived backwards, the desk flying over her and crashing into the far wall, shattering a framed poster. 

Kaina looked up at the end of the room, seeing a fire alarm switch on the wall near the hallway entrance. “I know you don’t really believe that, kid. And, don’t blame me on making this harder for you. Blame that fact that everything about your quirk is posted online.”

Kaina slid between the desks, her grapple shooting backwards as she took another shot at Hawks. He tried to cover himself with his wings, but the bullet slipped right through, slamming direclty into Hawks’ diaphragm, knocking every last ounce of air from his lungs. It certainly didn’t help his rib that he was still pretty sure was broken. He threw his wings out as he gasped for air, feathers flying everywhere. 

Kaina hit the back wall, throwing her elbow back and shattering the glass, pulling the white switch. The fire alarm blared, the red emergency lights kicking on as feathers began flying around at random, having no clear target. 

Kaina bolted, feathers stabbing into the wall where she stood. She rushed towards the windows, jumping up and spinning around, firing at Hawks. The force from her gun shot her through the window, crashing through the glass.

She knew Hawks had to be a good fighter, but she didn’t expect Hawks to sharpen his wings and slice right through the bullet, the pieces flying off on either side of him. 

“Okay, I’m fucking done.” Hawks launched himself directly at Kaina in breakneck speed. Her eyes went wide, grappling up the building, trying to dodge in any way she could. But, he was too fast. Just as was Kaina was being pulled up, Hawks’s blade sliced right through her right side.

Kaina yelped as she zipped up the side of the building, a shooting, sharp pain right under her ribs. She made it back to the roof, grunting in pain as she pulled herself up. 

Kaina propped herself up onto her arm, her other hand touching her side, sighing as she already felt her dress soaked and warm. She moved her hand away, seeing blood paint her skin. “Of fucking course.”

“I gotta admit, Ms. Nagant,” Hawks landed down on the roof, standing across from her, holding his side with a slight rasp still in his voice. “You’ve got a lot of fight left for an old timer.”

Kaina got up onto her knees, side-eyeing him as her blood hand tried to reload her rifle, “I’m thirty-eight, asswipe.”

“Hehehe. Okay…” Hawks pulled out another two feathers, more floating behind him, the feathers from inside the building coming back up to return to their place on his wings. “Let’s finish this…”

***\*ZOOM\****

Both assassins’ eyes widened as two streaks of light came over the side of the building, coming to a stop between them. The crackle of lightning faded, revealing Izuku and Kyouka standing in front of Kaina. 

Kaina and Hawks were both staring with raised brows, not quite sure where these two came from. Hawks clicked his tongue, putting on a smile for them, "Well, well, well, some back-up. Don't you kiddos worry, I got this all under contro-..."

Hawks was cut-off as Izuku and Kyouka weren't facing Lady Nagant...

They were facing him. 

He shifted his eyes between them, a little confused chuckle escaping his lips, "...Uh…You guys okay? With those looks on your faces, it's almost like you don't trust me or something. It’s me…Hawks, you know? Number two hero?”

Kaina held her bleeding side in silence, looking between the combatants of the stand-off in total confusion. 

"We think it would be better," Izuku stepped forward, "if we heard what Ms. Tsutsumi has to say."

Hawks eyes narrowed as a nervous smirk grew on his lips, "...That right?"

Kyouka stepped up next to Izuku, "That's right, KFC. So just hold your feathers for a minute."

Hawks scoffed with an eye roll, "KFC? Wow, totally haven't heard that before. But, really, I think it'd be better for all of us if you let me do my job.” 

"Your job?" Izuku asked, slowly stepping in front of Nagant. "...You mean your job as Lady Nagant's replacement."

Hawks smirk twitched ever so slightly, and Kaina’s eyes widened. 

How the hell did this kid know about her?

"I don't know what you're talking about, kid. But, slander like that, well...it's bound to get people into trouble. You wouldn't want that, would you?"

Kyouka shrugged, readying herself as she could hear everyone's heartbeats begin to hasten. She reached over her shoulder, grabbing the hilt of the Equalizer, "Getting into trouble is kind of our thing."

“Listen, kids, I’m serious. This is way bigger than you understand. Please, let’s just calm down and talk for a se-”

*“They have to go.”*

Hawks faltered at Madam President’s command came through the earpiece. He was frozen, his body unable to decide on his next move. 

“...Kids, could you just gimme a second?” He turned to the side, keeping his eyes on the couple and lowering his voice as he responded. *“Ma’am, they’re jus-”*

*“It’s irrelevant. They know, Hawks. I’m sorry, but you know what must be done.”*

*“...Ma’am, I’m begging you-”*

*“They’ve made their choice, Hawks. Now, you must make yours; the correct one. Their lives, or the safety and stability of the entire country. There will be panic amongst citizens, villains will take the opportunity to run rampant as we’re left leaderless and neutered. She’s working for the League. Think of Kamino, all those lives lost. If she wins, they win.”*

“Or…” Kyouka spoke up, clearly hearing everything the president had said. “You lose, and Japan gets someone they can actually trust. They can have someone who doesn’t resort to murdering everyone who causes them the slightest problem.”

Hawks blinked a couple times, clicking his tongue, “...Ma’am, I don’t think those things on her ears are for show.”

*“Even more reason to handle it.”*

Hawks clenched his face in frustration, already feeling sick to his stomach. “I-...”

*“Hawks…Japan needs you right now. More than anyone.”*

“...” Hawks ultimately sighed, looking over his shoulder at the couple. "...You're really doing this?” 

Izuku rolled his shoulders back, cyan lightning dancing around his body as he glared at Hawks, “You tried to kill my dad. What do you think?”

“Hm…Fair enough. I want you to know, I don't want any of this, but…” Hawks turned back to them, his wings spreading open. “...Your funeral.”

**A/N: Quick little thing here I wanted to ask.**

**The characters have gone over it a few times now, but I just really want to ask:**

**Is there anyone who's still confused as to how the OFA sharing works? I don't want the characters to go over it again and again, but there's always the possibility that I didn't explain or word it in the most understandable way. I did my best, but everyone reads into and process information in different ways. I'm still SO INCREDIBLY GRATEFUL that the reception to this has been 90% to 95% positive, and I just want to make sure that those who are still not sure how to feel or are just a little confused but going along for the ride are satiated to the best of my ability.**
