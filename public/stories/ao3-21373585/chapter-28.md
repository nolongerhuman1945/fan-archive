“So…today kinda sucks.”

Kyouka scoffed, “Whatever could have given you that idea?” The couple sat outside during lunch, both eating from the same tray as they leaned against a tree. Izuku insisted he wasn’t hungry, neither was Kyouka. But, she knew better than to let either of them drown themselves in muddled feelings and ignore bodily needs. “So…You wanna talk about it?”

Izuku shook his head, “I’d rather talk at home. Just let the school day end and be done with it. Who do you think I’m more worried about, anyway?”

“It doesn’t happen to be me, does it?” Kyouka asked rhetorically. “I get it.” Kyouka placed her chopsticks down, instead using her hands to hug Izuku’s arm. “I never did get to thank you for standing up to him.”

“Me? You didn’t need me. He’s still at Recovery Girl’s for his eye.”

“You know what I mean, dunderhead.” She kissed his cheek before continuing, “I could hear it, no one else was doing anything. Iida made his good ol’ report threats, but no one else tried to actually stop the little rat bastard.”

“I just don’t get him…” Izuku said, shaking his head.

“Yeah. I mean, he knows what porn is, right?”

Izuku broke out into laughter, “I’m not explaining that to him.”

“Good, a laugh. I’m getting through.” 

“There’s nothing to get through, it’s just…you know.”

“I do,” Kyouka agreed. “Well, hey, one stain on our day isn’t going to ruin it. We still have something great to look forward to. We’re telling Mr. Aizawa about us after school, remember?"

“...How does a social interaction that’s destined to be extremely awkward make this day any better?”

"Because we get to make our desire to be a Hero Duo official."

A little smile grew on Izuku's face, "Yeah, I-I guess you're right. We should really thank Iida. He's the one that suggested it."

"Eh, maybe hold off on thanking him for now. I'd bet money that Iida can't lie to save himself, so he's already a ticking time-bomb on our relationship being public. So, odds are we tell him we're a hero duo, and he proceeds to be terrible at playing coy and gives us overly exaggerated winks from across the classroom."

"C'mon, Iida's not that bad."

The door nearby suddenly opened, revealing the class president himself. "I just came out to inform you that lunchtime is almost over, and we're to report back to class soon. I hope you two enjoyed the peace and quiet of the outdoors, perfectly content with each other's company." Iida gave a thumbs-up and an exaggerated wink before going back inside.

"...Sometimes I don't even know why I bother."

Kyouka patted Izuku's cheek before standing up to head back inside. "Hey, it was better than what I was expecting.” They took their leave, heading back inside to dispose of their scraps and hopefully get through the rest of the afternoon without any trouble.

  
  
  
  
  
  

***…~AIV~...***

  
  
  

**(A Few Hours Later: Class 1-A)**

  
  

Apparently, Mr. Aizawa had other ideas…

"...It's been brought to my attention that someone here made an attempt to spy on the girl's locker room as they were changing. Fortunately, they were persuaded to stop. Now…Who did it?"

The class was silent, until Iida raised his hand, "But, sir, I already told you it was Min-"

"Quiet. I want them to say it. Heroes own up to their mistakes." After more silence, Shouta walked over to Mineta's desk and merely stared down at him with a blank expression. "...Who did it?"

Mineta looked up at his teacher with his good eye, the other covered by a bandage until it was fully healed. “...Me, sir.”

“Mm…” Shouta sighed through his nose before his blank expression turned into a scowl. "You're going to be in detention from today until summer vacation begins, and I'll be meeting with your parents. The mere attempt makes me want to kick you out right now." Aizawa bent down to be eye-to-eye with Mineta, his eyes glowing red and his glare fierce. "If you had gone through with it, I'd make sure you never come within one-hundred feet of another hero school. I've only heard tales of your antics before, but this is proof I've been too lax with you. You and your partner." Shouta said, an accusatory glare sent towards Denki. 

Kaminari stuttered, "I-I tried to sto-"

"Really? Did you *really* try to stop him? An actual effort?” Shouta looked back towards the rest of the class, more specifically at all of the boys, “Did *any* of you?” Everyone was quiet, most just ashamed to give the honest answer.

“Midoriya did, sir.” Shouta turned to Kirishima, who was the only one to speak up. “Iida threatened Mineta, but…Midoriya was the only person to really stop him. After that, Jirou must’ve heard us through the wall and, uh…well, you can see what happened,” Kirishima finished, gesturing towards Mineta’s patched up eye.

Shouta’s scowl never left his face as he heard the entire tale. He turned towards Kyouka, “You won’t be punished for your reaction.” He crossed his arms and looked at the boys of the class as he shook his head, “I have to admit, it took a lot longer than I expected. But, I can finally say I’m completely and utterly disappointed in you. Forgive me, I thought most of you were smart enough to understand what it means to be heroes, know when to intervene in a clearly wrong situation, to know that inaction can be just as bad as evil actions…I guess I overestimated you.” Shouta had never exactly been one for a lot of positive reinforcement, but hearing that still hit like a gut punch to many in the room. “Except for Midoriya and Iida, every boy in the classroom will write a five-page paper on the sexual harassment and sex-related crimes unit of your Hero-Work Textbooks, not including the formal apology you’re going to write to the girls, by first thing *tomorrow* using pencil and paper. Understood?” No one dared to groan or object. Shouta’s gaze returned to Denki, “Have you been involved in any of his ideas before?" Kaminari only looked down at his desk in silence. Shouta then turned back to Mineta. "Any harassment in my classroom, in this *school* , will be met with *extreme* consequences. Do you understand?"

Mineta gulped, nodding his head, "Yes, sir."

Shouta stood up, looking around the class, "This goes for all of you." He then looked at Denki in the next desk over, "...Understood?"

Kaminari didn't look scared, he just looked ashamed, "Yes, sir."

Shouta looked back to the rest of the class, awaiting a response. Everyone said they understood, waiting for Shouta to dismiss the class. But, he then walked over to the left side of the class and stood in front of Katsuki. "And when I say harassment, I mean harassment of any kind."

Katsuki furrowed his brow in confusion, "The fuck did I do?"

"If you don't understand that, then we have a long three years ahead of us." Shouta turned around and moved back to his desk. "Class dismissed," he said with a dismissive wave of his hand.

Everybody stood up and began filing out of the classroom, an uncomfortable silence filling the air as they left. Izuku sighed, covering his eyes as he rested his head on his hand. He was mentally and emotionally tapped out for the day, maybe even the week. 

“Hey, Midoriya?” Izuku tensed as he felt an unfamiliar hand laid down on his shoulder. He looked up to see Momo standing next to his desk. “I just wanted to say thank you, from the rest of the girls and I.”

“Oh, o-of course. I-AH!” 

Izuku was suddenly grappled into a hug by Mina, “Our hero!” She puckered her lips and went to plant a long kiss to his cheek, “Mmmwah! Eh?”

Mina followed the hand that had gotten in between her lips and Izuku’s cheek to see Kyouka standing there with a blank expression. Kyouka placed her hand on Mina’s face and shoved her off, “Anyway! I’m sure Izuku appreciates the gesture, but we have something very important to discuss with Mr. Aizawa.” Kyouka deadpanned as Mina grumbled and walked away. Soon, they were the last two students in the classroom. 

Izuku smirked, “Are you sure Iida is the ticking time-bomb?”

“I don’t share. Besides, even without knowing we’re together, Mina knows her place. Now, c’mon.”

“A-Ah, are you sure this is the best time? Mr. Aizawa seems pretty…” They both looked over to the other end of the room to see Shouta trying to open his sleeping back, but the zipper was stuck. He was furiously tugging at it, swearing under his breath. “...irritated.” 

“Well, you’re pretty much the only guy in class he likes right now, so weirdly enough this might be the best time.” 

Izuku sighed, “I guess we’ve been talking about doing this long enough.” They approached Shouta’s desk, neither sure how to start the conversation as their teacher had opted to forgo the zipper and was trying to slip in the sleeping bag feet first. 

Kyouka began, "Uh…Mr. Aizawa, is it a bad time to talk to you about something?"

He turned around, sleeping bag around his waist, “Oh…you’re still here.” Shouta furrowed his brow, "Has Mineta done something directly to you?"

"Oh! Nonono, it's not about that. I can handle that creep, he's terrified of me. This is an unrelated matter." Aizawa tiredly sighed, running a hand through his hair before motioning for Kyouka to continue as he sat down at his desk. "Mr. Aizawa, you see the thing is, Izuku and I are…well, you se-"

"Dating. Got it. And?"

"...Wow, are we really that obvious?"

"You play the Friendzone in public well, with some moments of exception. But, it's my job to observe all of my students. I notice certain things like this from time-to-time."

Izuku and Kyouka looked at one another, both understanding how serious their request was. Kyouka turned back to Aizawa, "I know this might sound stupid for a high-school couple to be thinking so far into the future, but…we want to be a hero duo. Like, officially. Same agency, our names used together, well…everything."

Izuku cleared his throat and added, "S-So, we w-were wondering if there was anything we could do to further that. W-We wanted to tell you in case there was some sort of ch-change in curriculum or practices when it comes to hero duos. O-Or, if for partner assignments, if that means we have to be paired together. Learning to fight together will be essential for us. Especially after wh-what happened with the Hero Killer."

Kyouka nodded, "We weren't exactly perfect. We got thrown into each other…a lot. We know th-"

Aizawa suddenly opened up his desk and placed a paper down, "Both of you sign here." Both teens looked at one another in confusion, then back at Aizawa. Shouta saw their confusion and sighed, "Listen. Hero duos can become complicated. Duos that are real-life romantic partners can get even more complicated. But, I've seen you two work together. I've seen faster improvement from you two than almost any students I've ever had, and I can tell it's from your relationship. Yes, I'm a hardass. I can be tough, and my methods aren't ideal in manys eye's. But, the future of my students is my top priority. I'll teach them to survive, how to make it…and, doing my best not to sound like that hulking mass of Japanese-American patriotism…achieve their dreams. If this is your dream, then we'll make it happen."

Both students were silent, surprised by the sudden openness from their teacher. "Th-Thank you, sir," Izuku responded.

Shouta raised a pen out to them, "Sign this, and UA will recognize you as a 'Hero-Duo-in-Training'. Any further internships and partner training assignments will automatically assign both of you together. You're now a package deal, so any future internship requests will be shown that before deciding if they want you. Your grades, while remaining separate, will also reflect one another. If one begins to fail, the other shall also be held responsible for their partner's failure, and will be expected to help. You're responsible for one another. Once you graduate, UA will sign you both off as an official duo. If you are to both pass with above average GPAs, UA and the Hero Public Safety Commision will give you a large grant to begin your agency. It's a *lot* of money. Keep that in mind. You can both terminate your partnership before graduation, but both partners must sign off on it. Is that all clear to both of you?"

One last time, Izuku and Kyouka looked at one another before Kyouka smiled at their teacher, "Pass that pen."

Kyouka took the pen and signed her name, and Izuku followed directly after her. But, then Izuku looked down at the blank line under their names, “Oh boy. We forgot a name.”

Kyouka furrowed her brow as she looked down at the paper again, “Name?”

“Our duo name. Every hero has their titles, the same works for groups.” Izuku turned back to Mr. Aizawa. “U-Uh, sir, we-”

“It’s fine,” Shouta assured them. “It’s not required, but if you think of one just come back to me tomorrow. I’ll go inform Nezu, and we’ll finalize the papers tomorrow if you have a name. I should, however, mention that this will make certain things difficult. For instance, the midterms are a couple months away. The plan is to have the students face off against situations where their quirks can be used to great effect. You two…no offense, bu-"

"Sound and punching don't exactly mix. We know. Lean towards Izuku's favor."

"B-But, Kyouka-?"

"I need to learn to face big situations, too," she interrupted. "What you face, I'll face." Izuku knew she was talking about All For One, and he also knew there was no changing her mind on the matter. 

"...Okay," Izuku nodded.

Shouta hummed to himself, remembering who exactly they would be going against in their test. "Good luck. You'll need it." Shouta rubbed his temples with a groan, “First the bone-breaking, then the running out of school, the two of you attacking the Nomu, everything from the Sports Festival, the Hero Killer, everything that’s happened today, and now this. Why are you two *always* somehow involved? The Problem Children.”

Izuku rubbed the back of his neck, “U-Uh, to be fair, Mr. Aizawa, it’s most likely j-just me. Kyouka’s th-there to make sure I come out of those situations alive.”

“You two just signed a contract that makes you a package deal. You’re the Problem Children.” Shouta picked up the contract and slid it into a manilla folder as he stood up from his desk. “This is a big step, especially for first years. We only get a handful of duos on rare occasions, but most are at minimum second years. So, I’ll say this: My expectations of you are even higher than before. You two are clearly very serious about your futures, so I’ll be expecting real dedication. Romantic partners as heroes can either push the other further, or be a distraction. Like I said, you’ve been nothing but the former so far, but that can quickly change. Just keep doing what you’re doing, and we’ll be fine.”

Both teens nodded and answered together, “Yes, sir.”

Grabbing their bags, they began to leave. But, Kyouka stopped at the door and turned back to her teacher, "Oh, by the way, um…could you not tell anyone about us? At least, the relationship portion of it."

“Do I look like Nemuri to you? I’m no gossip.” Accepting that answer, Shouta’s students left the classroom. Aizawa ran a hand down his face with a long groan, "Why is this my most complicated class?"

Shouta stood up from his chair and left the class, making his way towards the elevators to head up to the top floor. 

“Hold up!” Shouta grabbed the door to stop it, allowing a rushing Toshinori to enter. “Phew, thanks. Top floor, please.”

Aizawa hit the button, sending them up towards their destination, "You heading up to Nezu as well?"

Toshinori nodded, flicking through a short stack of pages in his hand, “Just finished printing off my reports from the internship. Unfortunately, with all the craziness that happened, it was twice as long as it would have been, so I’m only getting it to him now.” 

"I’m sure.” Shouta merely flicked his eyebrows up in response, his hands moving to his pockets. "...So, what were you doing in Hosu, anyway?"

"Oh, I was visiting my mother. She's buried in Hosu." 

"Hm, okay. Pretty convenient Midoriya was there the exact same night, huh?"

Toshinori sighed, "You know, Eraserhead, you're the last person I would expect to act coy. Do you have something you want to say?"

Shouta bored expression remained, "Do you?"

"No. I don't. If you think I'm lying, I can take you up to see my mother's grave this weekend. Make a whole day of it. Doesn't that just sound fun to you?"

"Sarcasm? That's unlike you."

"Being around Young Jirou tends to do that to you."

"Hm, I can imagine." Shouta nodded, looking down at the floor. He really didn't want to betray his students' trust. But, if he was right, and he was sure he was, then what he was about to do wouldn't matter. "Those two definitely influence people, especially one another. Jirou and Midoriya, I mean. I guess that's what relationships do to you."

Toshinori's eyes widened, "They told you?"

"They told me when they signed up to be a Hero Duo just a few minutes ago." Aizawa raised the paper in his hand, "Just need to get this to Nezu and they're set."

"Oh, that's amazing."

"Mhm, it should be interesting." Aizawa took a deep breath, "I'm admittedly glad they told me about their relationship. Makes things much less complicated to deal with. They've been so secretive about it. Which does beg the question…" Shouta looked up to Toshinori, "...How do you know about it?"

Toshinori's heart stopped for a moment, before he quickly responded with, "I went to check in with Young Jirou again the morning after the fight. Young Midoriya was already in her hospital room. They were asleep together. I figured I should keep their secret."

Shouta looked at him for a few moments, analyzing his answer before giving an amused scoff, "God-damn it, I'm dealing with love-drunk teenagers, aren't I?"

"Well, Nemuri will have a field day. She's a romantic, through and through."

"We should keep this to ourselves though. They asked me to keep it a secret."

Toshinori furrowed his brow, "But, you just told me."

Shouta looked over to his fellow teacher, "You already knew."

The elevator came to a stop, allowing Shouta to exit and make his way down the hall without another word. Toshinori sighed, realizing he had played himself right into Aizawa's trap.

The man had no evidence, or even a clue to what was really going on. But, his suspicions were enough to put the pressure on. 

If Shouta kept pushing, things were going to get a lot more complicated.

  
  
  
  
  

***…~AIV~...***

  
  
  
  

**(One Hour Later: Kyouka’s Room)**

  
  

Kyouka threw her bag on the floor as she yawned, “Well, at least we ended it off on a high note.”

“Mhm,” Izuku nodded in agreement as he discarded his own bag, “We’ll have to tell your parents when they get here. They’ll probably want to know that their daughter just legally bound her career to another person.”

Kyouka shrugged, “They did it.”

“Yeah, but they’ve been married for twenty years. We’ve known each other for four months, and have been dating for two.”

“What? C’mon it…” Kyouka furrowed her brow as she thought back on the year. “I…Wow…It felt *way* longer than that. But, I mean, you don’t regret it…right?”

“It was my idea, remember?” Izuku shook his head, unbuttoning his blazer and tossing it on the piano seat. “I’m sorry, I’m just tired. It’s just…Long day, you know?”

Kyouka nodded with a sigh, shrugging off her own blazer and moving over to Izuku. She took hold of his tie, bringing him down for a quick kiss before undoing it for him. " I know. Screw the day, we’ve had a long few months. But, just look on the bright side. You're the girls' hero, you don't have to write a paper, and I fulfilled my promise of poking that sucker in the eye. Now all that's left is giving Bakugou a swift dick kick."

Izuku chuckled, “I get a feeling that last one is going to be difficult to pull off.”

Kyouka slipped off the tie from around Izuku’s neck, then ran a hand through his hair, “Where’s my optimistic boyfriend, huh?”

Izuku leaned into Kyouka’s touch before deciding that it wasn’t enough. He wrapped Kyouka in a hug, "Kyouka…I don't like who I turned into today." Izuku furrowed his brow, frustrated as he tried to find the proper words to express himself. "It's not defending you and the other girls that I don't like. I'll do it again, and again. Not that you can't defend yourself, it's just…"

Kyouka nodded quickly, "I get it. I'd do the same for you." She took him by the hand and sat them down on the bed. “Go ahead.”

"…I don’t like being angry. But, I feel it all the time. I mean, I'm happy. Incredibly happy. This has easily been the best year of my life, but sometimes I just catch myself being angry, and there's no one in particular I'm even mad at. It's just…everything. And, then the pressure builds up and I…I-I snap. Like at my mom, or at Mineta, or Kacchan during our fight. There's just… *something* in me that wants out, but I won't let it. I've always tried to be optimistic, but then stuff like today happens." Izuku breathed in deep, then looked up at Kyouka, "I almost hurt someone today. This is different from a villain, or defending myself. I almost hurt someone today, because I was angry at them. Because I don't like them…Because, I-I…I wanted to. I'm not…I don't wanna b-"

"You're not a bully," Kyouka quickly intervened, already knowing where Izuku's thought process was going. "What happened to you, and what happened today, are not the same. Not even close. Everyone in the class knew Mineta had it coming, and you just couldn't take it anymore. It doesn't help that you're romantically involved with one of the girls he would've seen…Or, does help, I guess."

Izuku gazed down at his feet, shaking his head in disbelief, "How are you so much stronger than me? Every time my emotions spike, I just feel myself crumble, and you have to pick up the pieces. You told me everything you're dealing with, and I'm still the center of attention."

Kyouka shook her head, placing her hand in his, "I'm not strong. All I ever did was fall apart. You just keep me together. I'm returning the favor. You went through over a decade of shit; you've more than earned the right to fall apart. Don't feel bad about me, I happily signed up to keep you together."

Izuku gave a dry chuckle, "So, if we ever break up, we're both screwed."

"One-hundred percent."

“Hmhm…I guess I’ve just never got over what he said about you on the first day of school.”

Kyouka shrugged, “And to be fair, I get a feeling that he knows if he had mentioned getting a peek at me, things would have ended even worse for him. You probably would have sent him three cities over in a single punch.”

“I-...” Izuku tried to retort, but his response died on his lips, “Y-Yeah, that’s…that’s actually fair.” Izuku’s face then scrunched up in disgust, “Oh, God, yeah. Now I’m thinking about him actually being attracted to you and it’s just making me more angry.”

Kyouka facepalmed with a laugh, “Maybe his taste in women has actually been a blessing in disguise for us. At least he left us alone. But, now hopefully he’s learned his lesson about perving on the rest of the girls.”

Izuku rubbed his temples before he laughed, “I guess…Hehehe…”

“What?” Kyouka smirked back. 

Izuku shook his head, a smile he couldn’t get rid of apparent on his face,  “N-Nothing.”

Kyouka smiled, cherishing the lightening mood, “Nuh-uh, you don’t get to back out of this. What?”

Izuku sighed, “...I guess I shouldn’t expect him to have perfect taste in women like I do.”

Kyouka covered her face as she burst out laughing, falling back onto the blankets, “Hahahahahahaha! Oh my God, that’s *so* bad! Hahahaha!”

“I tried, okay!” Izuku laughed back. “It’s still true though.”

Kyouka moved her hands away from her face, “Lemme guess, and your taste in women is me exclusively.” 

“Exactly.”

Kyouka raised her arms out, “Get over here you cheesy bastard.” Izuku crawled over and hovered over Kyouka. She wrapped her arms around his neck, pulling him down to bring their lips together. “Are you feeling better?”

“Much. Thank you.”

“Like I said, it’s what I’m here for.”

“But, enough about me though.” 

Kyouka playfully groaned, “I don’t wanna focus on me.”

“I made a promise, and I have to keep it. I know you’re affected by what happened today, too. You’re just a lot better at containing yourself than I am. But, I guess showering your body with praise can wai-”

“Nonono, I take it back! Praise away.”

“Okay. Okay,” Izuku laughed out, “Um, I talked about your hair last time. So, I guess I should move on. I love your face."

Kyouka snorted out a laugh, "Uh-uh, thank you."

Izuku laughed, "I don't know how else to phrase it. Hm…When I first saw you walk into Recovery Girl’s office, I was just…captivated. Your features are so soft…angelic. Yet, your expressions can be so hard, absolutely judgemental of whatever it's facing."

Kyouka chuckled and shook her head, "Way to make me sound like a good person."

"Then there's that: Your laugh. Your nostrils flare a little, you close your eyes, and you smile wide and bright. I don't think I'm very funny, but…I'll always keep trying just to see that look on your face. Or, well, I just hope my various slip-ups continue to amuse you."

"Oh, very much so. Man, who knew spending most of your life practicing observing people and keeping note of it would help you seduce the ladies?"

Izuku blushed, rubbing the back of his neck, "W-Well, technically I seduced you a long time ago."

“Well…” Kyouka’s jacks hooked around Izuku’s ears, bringing him down closer, “it’s working again.” Their lips clashed again, this time with even more passion put behind it. She nipped at Izuku’s bottom lip as he undid her tie, allowing him clear access to her neck. Kyouka sighed in content as Izuku kissed his way on and around her pulse point, “I want to continue this. I really really do, but I’m so exhausted.”

Izuku kissed her jawline before he nodded, “Yeah, me too. Ah, but I haven’t trained today. Not to mention we still need to study for midterms.” Izuku stood up from the bed, making his way towards his backpack. But, Kyouka’s left jack wrapped around his wrist to stop him.

“I can tell you’re tired. We just got back from our internships, and we already got a bunch of bullshit thrown at us. Our grades are good, we can worry about studying later.” Kyouka patted the spot next to her on the bed. “C’mere.” 

“But, I-”

“Nap.”

“Kyou-”

“Nap!”

Izuku's exhaustion and Kyouka's persistence finally beat his stubbornness. He sat down on the bed, allowing Kyouka to lower him down to the mattress. Izuku sighed in content the moment his head hit the pillow and Kyouka curled up into his side, “...You were right.”

Kyouka kissed his cheek before nuzzling into Izuku’s shoulder, “Mhm.”

Izuku closed his eyes, his body already beginning to allow sleep to overtake him. *‘Just remember, life is good. Life is good.’* Izuku peeked one eye open as he watched Kyouka’s jacks reach down and drag the comforter over them. He felt Kyouka’s warm breath against him as she snuggled closer, *‘Yeah…Life is very good.’*

  
  
  
  
  

***…~AIV~...***

  
  
  
  

**(Unknown Location)**

  
  

“I must admit, the Hero Killer’s arrest was…surprising.”

The doctor scoffed as he inserted the IV bag needle into All For One’s arm, “Which part? The part where he surrendered, or the part where now people aren’t sure if he’s a bad guy or not.”

“Both, I suppose. Now, nobody is certain if he is with our organization. Tomura’s Nomu simply sent a message of chaos, while the Hero Killer’s arrest video sent a message of someone with a purpose, a philosophy. They’re too contradictory. We will attract two different kinds of people now. Those who believe the Hero Killer was with us, and those simply wanting to partake in the chaos. Tomura will have to forge a story that both sides will believe. But, our name is out now. More will come, and he will adapt.”

The doctor shook his head, “I don’t see why you put so much faith in that kid. He’s a brat.”

“If you want me to be at the head of this, then I suggest you heal my body already.”

“We both know we’re years off from that.”

“Then believe in the boy. He’ll make a fine successor.” All For One changed the feed on his television, the screen showing the arrest of the Hero Killer. He focused on the green-haired boy standing behind Stain. When Stain surrendered, he watched that same boy become wrapped in a fierce hug by the girl of the teen group. “...We still need time. We’ll let them have their peace, for now.”

  
  
  
  
  

***…~AIV~...***

  
  
  

**(A Few Hours Later: Kyouka’s Room)**

  
  

Izuku woke up, his body somehow even more drowsy than when he went to sleep. He could feel that his left arm was asleep, likely due to the musician clinging to it like a child with a stuffed animal. Kyouka had turned in her sleep, her back was pressed against Izuku’s side and she was holding onto his arm. She was resting her head right where Izuku’s shoulder met his bicep. Izuku rubbed his eyes and carefully tried to slip his arm from Kyouka’s grasp.

…Which resulted in her grumbling in her sleep and holding on even tighter with her jacks wrapping around his elbow.

Well, he wasn’t going anywhere for a while.

He checked the clock on the nightstand, 7:23 p.m. glowed brightly in the dimly lit room. The golden-orange shimmer of the sunset pierced the dark room through the small gaps of the drapes. Izuku pulled his phone out of his pocket, along with his headphones. 

After plugging them in, he began scrolling through his music collection, which had expanded vastly in the last few months. Kyouka had sent him multiple different playlists with different styles of music to, and Izuku was quoting, “broaden your musical horizons because I refuse to have a boyfriend who knows as little about it as you do.”

It was a good thing Izuku liked to learn…and that he was absolutely smitten with the woman.

He played a song from the list of old music. A song called "Pirouette" by someone called Chiiild from the 2000s, back before quirks even appeared.

He laid his head back down, more relaxed than he had been in the last month. He didn't want to go back to sleep, or he would end up just staying the night. He was sure Kyoutoku wouldn't be all that happy finding him here in the morning. 

So, Izuku let his gaze wander the room, taking in the surroundings of his partner's personal space. He loved Kyouka’s room. It fit her so well that every time he entered it was like being a part of her. Izuku’s eyes eventually landed on some of her equipment in the far right corner of the room. Her collection of instruments was insane, but he focused on one item in particular. Kyouka’s guitar amp sat on the floor under her hanging guitars.

Izuku picked up his phone again, and looked up amplifiers to see if his thought process would prove fruitful. *‘Amp…Amplifiers...Ampere: the measure of an electric current in motion…Huh.’*

Izuku was shaken out of his thoughts as Kyouka released his arm and rolled over, now deciding to cuddle Izuku’s torso instead. “Whaddya doin?” She asked sleepily, one eye just barely open.

“...I think I just figured out our duo name.”

Kyouka raised a brow, “Lay it on me.” Izuku nodded his head over to the corner of the room, his finger pointing towards Kyouka’s equipment. “My amplifier?”

“Y-Yeah. AMP. You know, like, it fits for you obviously. And, amplifying my body, or it even works for ampere. The measure of an elect-”

“An electric current in motion,” Kyouka finished for him. “That definitely sounds like you, Cyan Speedster. Not bad at all. Sound, power, electricity.”

“Thunder and Lightning.”

Kyouka scoffed, “Oh my God. Really?”

“I-It works! That can be an attack name for us.”

“I wouldn’t say I’m very thunderous, but…Actually…” Kyouka propped herself up on her elbow, and looked down at Izuku, “Okay, hear me out. I’ve been thinking a lot lately about how we can work more fluidly together. And, I was thinking about gear and stuff, and maybe something that both you and I can use effectively. My speakers are exclusive to my quirk, and the Equalizer is the most effective when I’m using it. But, I was thinking that I kinda want…a hammer.”

“A hammer?”

“Yeah, a pretty big hammer. It’ll be for bigger situations, I doubt I can carry that thing around all the time. But, I can plug into it, cause massive shockwaves, stuff like that. And, maybe we can see if the Support Studio can find a way where you can charge it up or something. And, I think it goes without saying that you with a hammer would be fairly effective.”

“That’s…actually a really good idea.”

“Oh! And I wanna call it the Boombox.”

Izuku chuckled, “Of course.”

“Hey, watch it, Mr. Thunder and Lightning.”

“I didn’t say it was bad! I’ll make some sketches. I’m sure Hatsume will hop on it immediately.”

“Awesome.” Kyouka looked over at the clock and grimaced, “Crap, that was a bit longer than just a nap. Ugh, and why did I decide to sleep in my school clothes? Now I have to iron these.” Kyouka gave Izuku a kiss before sliding off the bed and moving towards her closet. Once she was inside, Izuku hopped off the bed, grabbed his backpack, and sat down on the floor. He grabbed his notebook and a few pieces of scrap paper and spread them out in front of him. He opened his journal to Kyouka’s entry, and got to work.

Kyouka stepped out of the closet in black leggings and…

Izuku furrowed his brow, “Is that my ‘T-Shirt’ shirt? I thought I lost it.”

Kyouka’s eyes widened and she gave a nervous smile, “Right, well you kinda did. We went to train a couple weeks ago, and you switched shirts to workout in. You forgot it here, and…I more or less forgot to tell you.”

“More or less?” Kyouka simply blushed and rubbed her arm. Izuku just smiled and got back to work. Kyouka walked past Izuku, kissing the top of his head as she made her way over to her guitars. She picked up her acoustic, her eyes landing on her amplifier sitting against the wall.

“Huh…Amp.” Kyouka looked over her shoulder and smiled at Izuku. “I like it.”

Izuku smiled back before going back to work. He scratched down some quick sketches, erasing every mistake he made in his attempt to make Kyouka’s image a reality. 

He heard Kyouka begin to play her acoustic guitar, curled up on her window nook. Izuku recognized the song. It was from another centuries old band she liked from the West called Journey. 

*“When the lights go down in the city.~”* She sang softly, only just audible to Izuku. *“And the sun shines on the bay. Do I wanna be there in my city? Oh, oo, oh.~”* Izuku looked up from his journal, and his heart stopped. Back on the night they had become official, Izuku had caught Kyouka in the moonlight, and he thought there was nothing more beautiful. Now, he had a strong contender, and he couldn’t decide which was better. “ *So you think you're lonely. Well my friend I'm lonely too. Oh, oo, oh~.”*

Kyouka was completely bathed in the rays of the vanishing sun. The saturated orange contrasting on her deep violet hair and shining off of her eyes; the purpling skies contrasting with her porcelain skin, but blending so naturally with her…

Izuku almost couldn’t believe she was real. Hell, that was how he had felt everyday since he had met her. 

This girl, who easily could’ve slipped away had he never gotten the nerve to speak to her. 

This girl, who made him laugh, made pain go away, made him even more determined, stronger, who he trusted, who he believed in and *she* believed in *him* .

This girl, that ignited a roaring fire in his body that he never even thought was possible to feel, all from just a simple look, a touch, a few words. 

This girl, who had risked so much for him, and would continue to do so purely out of the goodness of her heart. 

This girl…who was everything. 

He didn’t care if people said teenagers know nothing about it, that he was too young to truly understand. 

He didn’t care that in the grand scheme of things, she hadn’t been a part of his life for that long. 

As he gazed at Kyouka, her perfect voice gracing his ears, strumming away on her guitar, her passion on display for him, and only him, to partake in, all bottled up in the most beautiful being he had seen or ever will see, there was only one thing on his mind. 

One absolute. He really just couldn’t put a veil over his eyes anymore, too scared of falling too fast and ruining things.

*‘...I’m in love with her.’*

Kyouka’s eyes flickered over to Izuku, their eyes met and her heart stopped. Kyouka thought she didn’t tell him enough how handsome she thought he was. She needed to. If she was willing to accept all this praise about her looks, he deserved it right back. Kyouka wished she could say she was captivated instantly when she first laid eyes on him, like Izuku said he was to her. But, that’s not how it was processed for her. She never really looked at people like that. 

It was just little things that made this big picture. When they met, she could see such curiosity in his eyes, and it was cute. He would rub his chin as he thought. He’d furrow his brow, bite the inside of his cheek, eyes set on nothing, as if he was imagining his journals all splayed out in front of him. 

Later, she’d see his face when he was determined, which she found downright sexy.

But, she was sidetracking herself. As they spoke in that office, she then realized she liked his curly hair and its color. Next, those cute freckles of his. His smile, she thought his nervous stutter was adorable (even though she knows Izuku would probably prefer being without it), even that stupid tracksuit he had been wearing was kinda funny. 

All of it just suddenly came together as a whole, and she realized she didn’t just like those little things. She adored them. 

Then, even if unintentionally, he made her laugh. And, she just couldn’t get enough of him. It took a bit of poking and prodding on her end, but eventually he began taking her jabs and jokes in stride. Even trying to return a few of them with his own. Talking to him just came so easily. She could see he was as iffy about meeting new people as she was. 

To think she was going to be content with just sitting there and not talking to him. She wished she met him sooner, but apparently life always wanted to wait until a person’s teenage years to drastically change their lives forever.

This boy, who would risk his life for a stranger, and who knows what for someone he loves. His pure heart was just so wonderful.

This boy, who she would risk everything for, too. She’d face it all with him. 

This boy, who made her pain go away, made her stronger, that made her a better hero.

This boy, that made her heart soar, made her feel like so much more.

This boy, that she wanted to give everything to, who she believed in more than anybody, who believed in her.

She didn’t care what anyone said about how little time they had known one another. She couldn’t imagine life without him. She didn’t *want* to imagine life without him. He was better than any song. Trusting her instincts was usually inadvisable since she was a hormone-filled, stressed out teenager. 

But, there she sat, staring at this beautiful boy, pages of notes laid out around him. He was in his element, using his brilliant mind to help her, which in turn would help dozens or even hundreds of people in the future. His emerald eyes sparkling in the setting sunlight, his face covered in a warm glow as he stared back with adoration in his eyes. A look she hoped she was giving back in full force. 

Yeah...She just couldn’t help it. She knew. 

*‘...I’m in love with him.’*

Kyouka asked, “Something on your mind?”

Izuku swallowed, opening his mouth to respond. But, he just shook his head. “No…You?”

Kyouka smiled warmly at him, shaking her head as well. “...No.”

They smiled at one another, simply content with the other’s presence as they went back to their business.
