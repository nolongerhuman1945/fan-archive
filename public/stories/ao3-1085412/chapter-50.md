*10* *th* *November 1994*

The Wizengamot was in chaos.

Sirius watched carefully at the shouting brouhaha and reminded himself never to piss off Griselda and Augusta since both of them were doing a sterling job of shouting Wenlock into submission, and simultaneously staring down Flint and Gibbon who had stood up to agree with Wenlock's position on the proposed suspension of the Werewolf law.

He glanced across to where Lucius was observing the melee of heated debate with an expression of disdain and careful calculation. Too many people were giving themselves away, Sirius mused as he turned his attention back to the others.

Clearly Wenlock's wooing of the pureblood Ancient and Noble Houses that hadn't agreed détentes with Sirius had been somewhat successful since Flint and Gibbon had stood up in support of his argument against suspending the Werewolf law. Several of the minor pureblood houses were displaying supportive and submissive body language accompanied by approving expressions toward Wenlock. So Wenlock had a greater level of support than he'd had at the previous sessions.

Maybe, Sirius considered, Lucius's prediction of some of the minor houses rushing to hide behind Wenlock to avoid Voldemort's return was proving true. According to Lucius, Wenlock had sneered at Lucius's attempt to warn him. Sirius was satisfied they'd done the right thing and if Wenlock didn't take the warning seriously than that was not Sirius's problem.

For their part, the Potter alliance had done a good job of standing firmly behind Harry and not letting the threat of taking on Voldemort shake them. Daniel Greengrass had done a fantastic job of corralling the minor neutral houses. They might not be as ready to sign up to the Potter alliance as they would have been a month before, but they were also not wandering openly in Wenlock's direction. It helped that the neutral houses were not exactly in favour of the Werewolf law.

Since Sirius hadn't done anything but concentrate on Harry, he was immensely grateful to Daniel, Augusta and everyone else for stepping up. The flash of red and gold on his wrist had him smiling. Most of the Potter alliance was wearing them although a couple like Leonard Abbott were also wearing Diggory's yellow and black. His eyes slid to Amos in the fourth tier and he wasn't surprised to find the man glaring back at him. He moved his gaze onwards dismissively.

It was a confrontation waiting to happen.

Leonard had already run interference that morning at the session break, and Sirius was pleased for once that he had the use of Cornelius's floo which meant that he avoided the public forum of the atrium arriving because he had a feeling Diggory wanted a showdown in front of the press. Probably Diggoty wanted to confront him about the warning letter that Mary Baron in her capacity as Harry's solicitor had sent warning Diggory that if he continued to make snide insinuations about Harry's character and well-being in newspapers, they could and would sue him for slander, regardless of Harry's respect for Cedric. They'd sent a similar letter to the press warning them that they wouldn't tolerate slurs against Harry's character. They'd backed off since the letter which was good since the laws were completely nonsensical and Sirius wasn't too certain that they'd actually win if they brought it in front of the Wizengamot. Sirius wasn't too worried about the impact of a public showdown with Diggory in truth – he was fairly certain he could remain in control – but he didn't want to take part in something that would make it more difficult for Harry at Hogwarts.

It was tough.

Despite the visible support Harry was receiving from a good majority of the school population and his close friends, Harry returned every day from his classes with small lines of tension bracketing his mouth and eyes; a stiffness to his posture that suggested hours of being braced for an attack. It hadn't helped that the first day back, some students had worn badges proclaiming 'Support Diggory, Ignore Potter the Rotter.' The ringleaders had been punished under the Anti-Bullying policy, but it hadn't stopped Harry from being hurt by it. Sirius had never been so glad that he'd insisted on being on site for his son, for giving Harry somewhere that he could relax and be himself.

He wasn't impressed by Cedric Diggory either. Whatever good will had been generated in hearing Cedric's stand on the night Harry had been announced as a Champion had eroded. While there was nothing to suggest Diggory himself had known about the badges before they'd appeared, he hadn't exactly gone out of his way to state that they were unacceptable, and while Sirius had gathered from Harry's discussions with Neville, Ron and Hermione in their rooms that Cedric had stopped the more vociferous of his supporters from parroting his father, he hadn't quite shut them up either. The Hogwarts' Champion was, for the most part, ignoring Harry.

Strangely, both the other Champions seemed much more willing to think of Harry's inclusion as a good thing. Viktor Krum was surprisingly a stalwart supporter; he had turned up the evening before after apparently joining Harry and the Gryffindor team for Quidditch practice. Sirius had kept watch through an open study door to the living area in case he was needed but the discussion had revolved around Quidditch and Seeker moves, with Krum mentoring Harry like a big brother, or an older cousin. While Sirius still had concerns about Krum's befriending Harry, who was so much younger than him (and he figured some of it had to do with mutual issues with fame and because it was good politics), he was satisfied that as far as the tournament was concerned, Krum didn't have a hidden agenda.

It had been Wednesday night when Ron and Hermione had popped round to do their homework with Harry that Sirius had finally heard how Fleur Delacour had approached Harry at Monday lunch time to welcome him back and to inform him she looked forward to competing against him. Ron had been the one to blurt it out, mostly excited that Fleur was Veela. Harry had dismissed the whole thing as 'not a big deal' but accepted it was a nice gesture on Fleur's part. Sirius suspected that his dismissal of the French girl's action was partly to reassure Hermione that she was still the one he wanted to ask out.

Not that Harry had asked Hermione out during the past four days which was another source of frustration for Harry. The one time Sirius had asked how it was going and if Harry needed any help, he'd gotten snapped at in a way that Sirius remembered all too well from when James had been courting Lily. He had carefully not inquired since. Harry would work it out himself; Sirius knew that.

Sirius dragged his attention back to the Wizengamot which was settling back down after an admonition by Albus.

Dirk Cresswell, the Chair of the Committee reviewing the laws on Magical Races and Creatures, stood up again. "The Werewolf law passed in early June is a resoundingly ugly piece of legislation. It doesn't do anything except make it more difficult for a wizard or a witch infected with lycanthropy to find work in the wizarding world." The thirty-something good-looking wizard glared at the Wizengamot. "Imagine that you were bitten tomorrow. Immediately, you would be removed from your positions within this body. If you own your company, you are no longer able to retain ownership. If you work for someone else, they have the right to fire you. If you have money and property…maybe you will be able to buy Wolfsbane and survive. But if you need that job or need your company or rely on the status this position brings you…well, you will struggle the same way that over two thousand weres in our society already do."

There was a resounding silence.

Sirius glanced around and noted that there were some considering looks on those that a moment before had been vehemently opposed. His eyes swept over one of the minor neutral houses – Zeller – because according to Cornelius, there was a suspicion that Arnold Zeller was actually an unregistered werewolf.

"This legislation pushes werewolves into criminal behaviour out of desperation," Dirk continued passionately, "or it forces them to look for work in the muggle world and to place the secrecy of our world at risk." He made another sweeping look of the chamber. "I encourage you all to suspend this law immediately. Thank you."

Dirk was good, Sirius thought, impressed by the wizard. He had been Arthur's recommendation; a muggleborn wizard in the Goblin Liaison office who spoke fluent Gobbledegook.

Albus cleared his throat. "Let's vote."

The vote was passed in favour of suspension but it was a close thing. The Potter alliance remained steadfast despite some of the members previous voting through the law. Sirius breathed a sigh of relief as the session was closed and the Wizengamot started to empty.

Richard leaned over to him. "Shall we pretend to have an in depth conversation so Diggory can't approach you?"

"That would be great." Sirius said with a grateful smile as he sketched a privacy bubble. "Thank you."

"No problem." Richard said, grinning back at him. "I should be thanking you for sending me to Paris again. Flick had a great time." He waved a hand. "Only fly in the ointment was having to deal with Fevrier again. He really is a little turd."

Sirius nodded. Turd was a surprisingly good description of the French antiquities dealer; conman was the other term that came to mind. "I can afford his stringing me along for a while."

"At least we have our eyes open." Richard admitted. "Merlin knows how many people he must con out of a fortune."

"Too many." Sirius agreed. But he figured that Fevrier would acquire the Lumiere translation by the beginning of the next year and that was the only important thing.

"How's Remus?" Richard asked tentatively.

Sirius gave a soft hum in response. "Good, I think. He finds being Alpha a bit awkward but the others haven't given him any trouble at the chateau and seem to be accepting his leadership so…" he shrugged, "I'll be glad when he's back."

"And is Harry prepared for the Weighing of the Wands?" Richard asked.

"As much as he can be." Sirius smirked suddenly at the memory of Harry realised that his wand was going to be examined close-up. "He's taken a sudden interest in polishing his wand and I don't mean metaphorically or euphemistically."

Richard burst out laughing. He motioned towards the door. "We should be fine to leave now."

Sirius dismissed the privacy bubble and the two of them made their way down the stairs and out into the corridors of the Ministry. They parted at the stairwell; Sirius headed for Arthur's office and Richard made his way home.

Arthur waved him in, his blue eyes shining a welcome. "Sirius! I hoped you'd stop by."

"I wanted to apologise again for abandoning our weekly dinners," Sirius said, sinking into the visitor's chair, "but I don't want to leave Harry alone."

"Don't worry," Arthur assured him, "Molly and I understand. How's it going?"

"I'm glad I'm there." Sirius said simply. "I think I'd have gone mad if I hadn't managed to convince Albus to give us our own rooms and Harry had just gone back and I'd had to support at a distance."

Arthur frowned, his freckled face creasing with concern. "I thought the other students were being supportive?"

"His friends, yes; the Potter alliance and Gryffindor, for the most part although some are more vocal and visible than others; the rest of the school?" Sirius sighed. "It's a mixed bag because of the situation with Diggory." He motioned with his hand. "It was easy in the heat of the moment on Halloween for them to stand up and acknowledge that Harry hadn't entered himself but to continue to support him when he's gone on record as saying he'll try to win when the school already has a Champion?"

"It is a bold strategy," Arthur commented, "and given his history with facing danger, I wasn't surprised by it. But I know Molly was hoping that he'd walk out and do the least he needed to do to pacify the contract with the Goblet."

"It's not really Harry's style." Sirius murmured, a twinge of guilt running through him as he considered it wasn't his style either and he hadn't even attempted to convince Harry that there was another way of participating in the tournament. "Maybe I should have…"

"No," Arthur cut in before Sirius could verbalise the thought, "you're right to support his decision, Sirius. Harry is…he has instincts about these types of situations and if you'd done a Molly with him, he'd have walked out to do the task and gone with his instincts anyway, but without probably a tenth of the preparation he's getting now."

Whatever Sirius had been about to say remained unsaid as Percy barrelled into the room. Arthur's third son was clearly distraught and Sirius got to his feet, intending to leave.

"I've resigned!" Percy declared, giving no sign that he had even registered Sirius's presence.

"Oh Percy!" Arthur said, glancing in Sirius's direction.

Percy's chin came up. "It's pretty clear I'm going to be fired, and who can blame them since I was stupid enough to almost get my own family killed! I just didn't want to give them the satisfaction of kicking me out."

Sirius cleared his throat and finally Percy realised he was in the room. Percy went bright red then white under hid freckles.

"I'll leave you to it." Sirius said diplomatically.

"Thank you, Sirius." Arthur said. "Stay in touch and if you need anything, let us know."

"I will do." Sirius promised and made his escape.

It wasn't a surprise that Percy had resigned and Sirius thought it was probably the right decision. The likelihood of Percy being fired was very high since someone needed to take the blame for the breach of security that had happened with Barty Junior and Percy was a handy scapegoat. It was a shame but Percy hadn't endeared himself to his colleagues over the previous months. Sirius made a mental note to talk with Remus about it. It was possible that Remus needed an assistant to help with his steward duties and Percy, for all his faults, was a good worker.

Sirius had barely taken three steps away from Arthur's door when Amos Diggory appeared from a side office to stand in front of him, blocking his way.

"Black." Amos snarled.

"Diggory." Sirius returned evenly. Diggory had obviously waited for him. "I don't think we have anything to say to each other, do we?"

Amos's face turned a strange purple colour and Sirius briefly worried Amos was going to have a heart attack.

"Your solicitor may have threatened me, Black, but you'll find it's not that easy to shut me up!"

Sirius hummed under his breath and reminded himself that punching Amos wasn't a good idea. A waft of the other man's breath swept over him, and Sirius got hit with the stench of whiskey. This was not good, Sirius mused.

"You were slandering my fourteen year old son, Diggory. You can hardly be surprised that I stepped in. You would do the same if we were to make similar comments about your son." Sirius attempted to keep his voice calm.

"My boy isn't an attention seeking glory hound!" Amos blustered.

"And neither is mine." Sirius retorted, trying to keep his temper and reminding himself that Amos was counting on that very outcome. "I'll also remind you that my son didn't enter himself."

"Right," Amos said derisively, "he was entered by the oh-so-conveniently resurrected Bartemius Crouch Junior."

Oh, so that was his latest game.

Sirius smiled, and something must have registered with Amos that Sirius smiling wasn't a good thing because he took a step back.

"You don't want to go there, Diggory." Sirius said softly.

"Or what?" Amos bit out.

"Or you'll find yourself contradicting an official Ministry and DMLE view," Amelia's voice snapped, causing both men to turn to face her, "and the last time I looked, Amos, you weren't that stupid."

Sirius could have kissed her. Amos flushed brightly and scuttled away.

"You are a lifesaver." Sirius told Amelia as soon as Amos was out of earshot.

"I'm certain the life in question was Amos's." Amelia responded dryly.

"You'll get no argument from me." Sirius said candidly.

"Come on," she jerked her head towards her office, "you can floo to Hogwarts from mine and I'll give you my take on how Harry won our duel last night."

Sirius gave a grin and fell into step beside her.

o-O-o

*13* *th* *November 1994*

Harry adjusted his robes, letting the fall of material straighten. He looked at himself critically. His hair was as good as it was going to get, his glasses gleaned showcasing his green eyes, and his outfit was smart - sharp black trousers and a green silk shirt under his best black open robes with his family crests proudly displayed. He was ready.

Panic stirred faintly in the back of his mind, but he pushed it away before it could take hold.

He marched out of his room determinedly. Sirius looked up from reading the paper and smiled at Harry as he picked up the pink rose Neville had dropped off earlier that day.

"All sorted?" Sirius asked.

"I think so," Harry replied, hating the note of uncertainty that crept into his voice. He took a deep breath and nodded with more confidence. "Yes. Ready."

For a moment Harry thought Sirius was going to tease him as he often did when the subject of girls was raised, but Sirius smiled again instead.

"I don't think you'll need it, but good luck." Sirius said with a wink.

Harry smiled gratefully and threw on his invisibility cloak – he didn't want to be seen in transit with the rose. He left their quarters and made his way through the school to the Runes classroom. It was empty and for a second Harry wondered if he was going to be stood up, despite knowing that Hedwig had delivered a positive reply to his request for a rendezvous that morning. Before the thought could take root, the door opened and Hermione slid inside.

"Harry?" She called out softly.

He belatedly realised he was invisible and yanked the cloak off, throwing it over his arm. Hermione smiled brightly at him and he smiled back at her.

"Hey," Harry said warmly, "you look great." And she did. Her hair had been tamed again into soft curls that fell to her shoulders, and although she wore her uniform it was pristine, the Gryffindor crest catching the sun coming through the large windows. She looked very pretty.

"So do you." Hermione said shyly. She gestured at his hand. "Is that for me?"

Harry walked over to her and held out the rose. "It is. It's a token of...of, well a small token of how much I like you." He tried to ignore how hot his cheeks were burning.

"Thank you, Harry," Hermione took the rose with a nervous smile, "I think it's the first time anyone has given me a flower."

Harry took confidence from her pleased expression. "I know you know, and I know you know I know, but I wanted to ask you properly." He said a little hesitantly. "So…" he took another deep breath. "I really, uh, like you and I would really like it if you would agree to go on a real date with me?"

He was blushing again but so was Hermione and he held onto the delight in her eyes as a good sign.

"I really like you too and I would really like to go on a real date with you too." Hermione agreed softly.

They grinned at each other for a long moment before Harry reached for her hand and Hermione tangled their fingers together. The feel of her hand in his made Harry breathless. He squeezed her fingers gently.

"We do, uh, need to talk about…" He began.

She nodded enthusiastically, sending her curls bouncing. "Our friendship is the most important thing; I don't want to ever lose that." She said quickly. "And, of course, I don't want us to make things awkward for Sirius as far as the House of Black is concerned." She grimaced. "We need to make sure Ron especially doesn't feel left out too."

"Exactly." Harry breathed out a sigh of relief. "Sirius approves by the way."

Hermione smiled at him, her eyes alight with laughter. "I thought he might."

Harry smiled back because she was right; Sirius hadn't been at all subtle over the previous week.

"And so does Ron," Harry continued, "but I agree; we should make sure he's not left out."

"We will." Hermione assured him. Her face turned considering. "We really need him to wake up and realise Lavender is head over heels for him."

"Maybe he will now we're…we're dating." Harry said, hopefully. Delight sailed through him as he caught Hermione's flush at his words. He shifted position as his conscience prodded him. "About the actual date…"

"We need to wait until after the first task." Hermione said firmly. "You've only got just over a week to prepare after today's Wands ceremony and that has to take priority."

Harry stared at her. "You are just…thank you." His fingers brushed the band of red and gold on her wrist.

"Are you worried about it?" Hermione asked. "I've been trying to talk to you all week but there's always someone else around and…well, everyone else is getting ready for the Weighing of the Wands and we're alone so…"

He had chosen the time for them to meet up precisely for that reason.

"Yeah," Harry answered her initial question without thinking about it; they'd been friends too long for him to think twice about confiding in her – he wanted to confide in her, "I guess I am worried about it." He pushed his glasses up his nose with his free hand. "It is going to be dangerous and just because I wanted to make Voldemort regret entering me by doing well doesn't mean that I think I'm actually going to do well. Although, I mean, maybe I think I'm going to be OK with the first task? If it is something to do with magical creatures like everyone thinks? Because I think I'm good with those and the study plan is catching me up with theory and Moody was brilliant about tutoring me in the spells you listed for me, but…" he sighed and met her warm gaze, "I usually have you and Ron with me, you know? Whenever I've gone off to do one of these insane things and…now it's just me."

"It was just you and Voldemort at the end of the traps, Harry," Hermione reminded him, "and just you with the basilisk."

"You were there for Sirius though." Harry reminded her.

"But you were the one who produced the patronus that saved us all from the Dementors." Hermione said quietly. "You're…you're brilliant at this type of stuff. Do you remember what I said to you the first time? You're a great wizard, Harry."

A flush of warmth rushed through and his gaze snagged on hers. It was a perfect moment and his gaze dropped to her lips. His heart pounded a little bit as he leaned in toward her and he could feel her shift, leaning towards him…

The door to the classroom flew open and Harry immediately turned defensively, letting go of Hermione as his wand was unleashed from its holster.

"Expelliarmus!" He yelled.

A blur of purple went sailing back through the doorway as a wand whipped across the air between to land in Harry's outstretched empty hand.

He and Hermione rushed to the door and took in the sight of their potential attacker lying on the floor of the corridor with a stunned expression.

Harry blanched.

"Professor Dumbledore!" gasped Hermione as she hurried forward to help their Headmaster, Harry following belatedly in her wake with the Professor's wand in his hand buzzing with power as his thumb drifted over the mark at the base.

"It's alright, Miss Granger," Dumbledore took her outstretched hand and levered himself off the floor, "my robes have cushioning charms and no harm was done." His rheumy eyes met Harry's. "An impressive disarming spell, Harry."

"I am sorry, sir." Harry said miserably. "It's just…"

"No, no," Dumbledore waved off the apology, "I understand you are in a state of constant vigilance!" His eyes twinkled as he brushed the dust off his bright purple robes. "And quite right too! My own fault for believing two students lurking in a classroom would have nefarious motivations. If I had known it was you and Miss Granger I would have continued onto the Great Hall for the Wand ceremony." His eyes flickered to the pink rose Hermione held.

Both Harry and Hermione went bright red.

"Your wand, Professor." Harry said hurriedly. He flipped the wand over and offered it to the Headmaster.

Dumbledore paused and his keen gaze found Harry's again, a question in the depths.

And it was then Harry felt a whisper of something – a call that resonated deep inside of him – the wand calling out to his blood – Peverell blood. He could sense the power of the wand, the connection with the family magic that bubbled up eagerly to encourage him to accept the wand that it had once made, and there was an echo from the cloak left lying in the classroom of recognition and welcome.

But it wasn't the right time.

They had no idea still how the Hallows were supposed to work together and Harry couldn't take the risk of owning a wand that was so powerful when there was the slightest chance Voldemort could get his hands on it.

Harry firmed his lips, ignored the whisper in his mind, and nodded briskly. He had a perfectly serviceable wand and the Elder wand was safest with Dumbledore.

"Thank you, Harry." Dumbledore took his wand back and smiled somewhat sadly at it.

The nudge of something faded and Harry shrugged the feeling away as though trying to dislodge an itch.

Hermione threw Harry a curious look and he mouthed the word 'later' at her.

"Well, we should all be making our way to the Great Hall, I believe." Dumbledore said chirpily. "After all, you and I are participating in today's Ceremony, Harry."

More's the pity, Harry thought, before he nodded his agreement and gestured back at the classroom. "I just have to pick up my cloak."

"Ah, then I shall leave you and Miss Granger to make your own way while I check that all is in order." Dumbledore sighed. "We had not planned for this to be in front of the whole school originally!"

He glided away and they watched him disappear around the corridor before looking at each other nervously.

Harry started to chuckle at the memory of Dumbledore sailing through the air. Hermione looked at him askance.

"It's not funny, Harry. I can't believe you disarmed Professor Dumbledore!" She said, folding her arms over her chest.

"It's a little funny." Harry countered as he went back into the classroom and picked up the silvery material he'd left on the floor. There was no time to return it. "Dobby!"

Dobby popped in immediately. "You bes calling Dobby, Master Harry Potter, sir?"

"We have to get to the Wand ceremony," Harry explained, "can you take my cloak back to my room for me, please?"

"And my rose back to my dorm, please?" Hermione asked quickly. She smiled at Harry. "I don't want it getting damaged."

Dobby hopped happily taking both items. "Dobby will take care of all." He popped away again.

Harry held out his hand a little anxiously but Hermione simply rolled her eyes and took it with another shy smile. He was giddy as they walked to the Great Hall, discussing the history behind the ceremony that Hermione and her researchers had uncovered. By the time they entered the wide doors, Harry was reassured that it was a fairly straightforward examination of his wand without the possibility of any spirits manifesting or strange things happening.

"Harry!" Rita swooped on them as soon as he and Hermione crossed the threshold into the hall. Her eyes glittered behind her oversized specs, arrowing in on their joined hands. "Is there something that you want to tell the readers of the Daily Prophet?"

"Yes," Sirius was suddenly beside Harry, his hand heavy on his shoulder, "he wants to tell you that he can't take part in conversations with the press without his guardian present, Rita."

Rita wasn't phased by the rebuke. "Lord Black," she said dryly, "what a surprise to see you here." She motioned at the other Champions already gathered up at the front of the hall. "I didn't realise that the families of the Champions were allowed to be present, or have they made a special exception for you?"

Harry kept his face impassive knowing Sirius was more than capable of handling the question with its nasty undertone.

"The other Champions are of age," Sirius pointed out, "and therefore don't require an adult to safeguard their interests; Harry is still a minor and therefore when appropriate will have a guardian present at official tournament meetings." He smiled sharply.

Rita gave a weak smile in response and made her way back to the other journalists.

"Ready, Harry?" Sirius asked him quietly.

Harry grimaced but nodded. He felt Hermione squeeze his fingers before letting go.

"It'll be fine, Harry." She promised and swiftly headed in the direction of the Gryffindor table to where an avid Lavender and Parvati seemed to be awaiting her, along with a smug looking Ron and Neville.

Harry was ushered forward by Sirius and he missed the dark looks of consternation and understanding from his stalkers; the disappointment that had Ginny lowering her head, hiding behind a fall of red hair. Instead, Harry fell into line beside Viktor who acknowledged him with a grim smile; Fleur bowed her golden head a touch, and Cedric did what Cedric had spent the previous week doing; he ignored Harry.

Harry huffed out a breath and breathed in slowly, refusing to allow himself to get frustrated in front of everyone.

"Ah, excellent!" Dumbledore spoke up loudly, silencing the Hall immediately. "Now that we are all gathered, we can begin!" His gaze swept around the room and the doors to the Great Hall banged shut as Hagrid closed them. "We had initially intended this to be a quiet affair, but with recent developments it was felt more appropriate to make this a public event for our three schools and, of course, the illustrious members of the press." He smiled benevolently to the right where Rita, Luna's father and Esmeralda Goose sat on a narrow bench. "So, the Weighing of the Wands Ceremony dates back quite a number of years and is where the Champions' wands are examined to ensure fairness. I am pleased to introduce Master Wand-maker Ollivander who will do the examinations."

The old wizard stepped forward and bowed to the politely applauding students. "Thank you. If I could see Mister Krum's wand first, please?"

Viktor stepped forward, resplendent in deep burgundy robes. He handed his wand to Ollivander briskly.

"A Gregorovitch." Ollivander lifted the wand examining it carefully. "Hornbeam and…dragon heartstring, ten and a quarter inches, thicker than I would have made it. Good condition, I see." He made a jabbing motion and a flock of birds erupted from the end of the wand and out of an open window. "Good, good. A fine wand, Mister Krum, and one most appropriate for a man with a penchant for the air."

The wand was handed back and Krum moved to the other side of Ollivander.

"Miss Delacour?" Ollivander waved her forward and took her proffered wand with a gallant bow. "Oh what a lovely wand!" He carefully lifted it to the light and made a gleeful sound under his breath. "Well, well. A Limone creation with rosewood and a Veela hair?"

"My Grandmother." Fleur confirmed, her accent heavy.

"Rather inflexible but…" Ollivander made the same jabbing motion as he had with Krum's and a shower of dragonflies emerged, flying over the crowd before disappearing. "Fire and air!" He said delightedly. "How remarkable but definitely appropriate for one of your beauty, young lady."

Fleur took her wand back with a pleased smile lifting her rosebud lips.

Harry tried not to fidget as Ollivander called for Cedric.

"Now this I recognise! My own creation!" Ollivander beamed at Cedric who beamed back. "Ash and the tail hair of a unicorn stallion. I remember it well!" He gave Cedric an approving glance. "You've taken excellent care of it, Mister Diggory."

Cedric continued beaming.

Ollivander made the jabbing motion for the third time and a single dove flew from the wand disappearing into the rafters of the Great Hall. "Ah, earth and air; a bird suggesting a pure heart and a desire for peace." His shrewd eyes met Cedric's. "You would be wise to listen to its message."

Two slashes of red appeared across Cedric's cheeks and he swiftly took back the wand to make his way to the other Champions.

"Mister Potter."

Harry tried to ignore the churn of nerves that had settled heavily in his stomach. He tried to ignore the fact that everyone was looking at him and handed his wand over.

"Oh my," Ollivander said, "I remember this wand very well." His intent look fell upon Harry. "Holly and a phoenix feather. It has seen battle since we last met, Mister Potter."

It was all he could do to nod.

"I did say that you could accomplish great things with this wand." Ollivander said quietly. "And so you have."

Harry couldn't quite manage a smile.

Ollivander frowned and he peered at the wand, darted a glance at Harry, and then one in the direction of Dumbledore. "Remarkable." He murmured before he jabbed the wand in a now familiar motion.

Fire shot out of the tip, forming a large blazing image of a phoenix in flight almost the height of the Great Hall. Harry's mouth fell open and he could hear gasps and shouts from the students and teachers. And as suddenly as it had appeared, the image disappeared leaving nothing but a trail of smoke.

"Fire and air symbolising rebirth, rising from the ashes." Ollivander blinked as he handed Harry his wand back. "You are a truly impressive wizard, Mister Potter. Great things indeed."

"Thank you?" Harry muttered uncertainly and quickly stepped over to the others.

"Are my fellow judges satisfied that the wands have been examined and cleared for use?" Dumbledore asked loudly before the quiet mutterings in the Hall could become actual babble.

Madame Maxime nodded with a large smile, Karkaroff gave a dismissive wave, and Ludo Bagman grinned broadly towards the press as he gave a thumbs-up gesture.

"Then the ceremony is over!" Dumbledore clapped his hands and dismissed the gathered students.

Harry searched out Hermione and they exchanged a quick smile before she left, flanked by Ron and Neville. Unfortunately Harry had to suffer through Bagman's insistence on a posed photo of all of the Champions before he finally got to leave with Sirius.

"So," Sirius sketched a privacy bubble as they walked to the tower, "I'm sure I don't really need to ask since you were holding hands with her and all but…how did it go?"

Harry smiled and knew he probably had a fairly sappy expression on his face but he didn't care. "She said yes!"

Sirius grinned at him. "Way to go, Harry!"

"And she understands about the date being delayed until after the first task." Harry added. "She was great about everything."

"I'm pleased for you, Harry." Sirius said warmly, slinging an arm around his shoulder.

"There was kind of a thing with Professor Dumbledore?" Harry hurried out the explanation of what had happened and by the end of it they were in their quarters and Sirius was howling with laughter.

It was good to see Sirius laughing for once. He hadn't done that enough recently, Harry mused, feeling guilty even though he knew it wasn't really his fault.

A knock had them both turning for the door. Sirius waved Harry back and went to answer it. Minerva and Ollivander were on the other side.

"My apologies, Sirius," Minerva said, "but Mister Ollivander was insistent on speaking with you and Mister Potter."

Harry's eyes widened and he could see Sirius morphing into his Lord Black persona as he considered the request and agreed to it, inviting Minerva and Ollivander into the room with an offer of refreshments.

Five minutes later, they were drinking tea, compliments of Dobby, and Ollivander's discreet suggestion of privacy had been dismissed with Sirius's confirmation that "Minnie had their complete confidence" to allow Minerva to stay.

Ollivander set his cup down. "You'll have to forgive me if I come directly to the point."

"Directness would be appreciated." Sirius countered, his expression guarded.

Harry found himself the object of Ollivander's unsettling stare once more.

"Mister Potter," Ollivander began, "am I right in assuming that you recently came into possession of the Headmaster's wand?"

Harry glanced at Minerva before he nodded. "I, um, accidentally disarmed him earlier today when he surprised me."

Minerva rolled her eyes, an exasperated breath escaping her, but she didn't rebuke him and Harry relaxed a touch.

"Hmmm," Ollivander's eyes sparkled briefly with amusement before sobering again, "do you remember that I once told you that the wand chooses the wizard, Mister Potter?"

Harry nodded, a sinking feeling in his gut at where the discussion was headed.

"The Headmaster's wand chose you when you proved your worth and disarmed him." Ollivander continued.

Sirius tensed beside him.

"I doubt that you could have failed to notice since the wand in question is powerful enough to make its choice known." Ollivander said quietly. "Yet somehow the wand remains with the Headmaster and you are facing a difficult tournament with a greatly inferior wand."

Harry bristled on behalf of his perfectly fine holly and phoenix wand.

"Wands don't change their allegiance that way." Minerva spoke up sharply.

"Ordinarily, no," Ollivander said with a slow smile, "but the Elder wand is no ordinary wand."

Everyone froze and Harry knew his own thoughts of should they deny it, should they admit they knew, were running through Sirius's head.

Sirius met Harry's eyes briefly before he sighed and acknowledged Ollivander's words with a tilt of his head.

Ollivander blinked. "You are all aware of the significance of the Headmaster's wand?"

"We are." Sirius replied.

The wand-maker looked shaken. "Then, you gave it back to the Headmaster knowing of its power?"

Harry shot a questioning look at Sirius for permission before he nodded. "The wand is safest with the Headmaster."

"Remarkable." Ollivander said, staring at Harry. "It was remarkable when I thought you had given up the wand without knowing but to give it up when you do know…even more remarkable. I assume you felt its pull?"

Harry settled for another nod, unwilling to explain the exact nature of the pull that he'd felt. There was a niggling feeling that he only had to focus and he would feel it again, its seductive whisper across his heart.

"I'm not sure I understand how the allegiance thing works," Harry admitted, vaguely remembering that Ollivander had said something in the memory he'd watched from Sirius's grandfather.

Ollivander smiled slightly patronisingly. "Wands choose the wizard because the magical element within them resonates with the wizard's own magical energy, the wood acting as a grounding force to allow the transference back and forth. Family members usually have similar energy so it's not unusual for children to be able to use their parents' wands or some other relative's. Generally, it's unusual for an opponent and non-relative in a duel situation to be a better magical match for a wand to change its allegiance. It has happened but rarely."

And OK, Harry thought he got that.

"But the Elder wand doesn't work that way." Sirius stated.

"It is an unique wand without a core magical element, but a powerful wand that understands power." Ollivander expanded, with a gesture meant to convey the more the better. "And so, if it feels one wizard has more than another, say because it was taken in a disarming spell, it sides with that wizard and will not work for the one who holds it if he tries to use it against the wand's chosen master. It is said to be the reason why it always ends up with the victor of the duels it has participated in."

"So it has no true allegiance?" Minerva questioned, a worried frown creasing her forehead.

"In some tales of the wand, that is the theory. However, one origin story says the wand has no allegiance except to the blood that runs through it." Ollivander's gaze slid to Harry. "The blood of the Peverells – your bloodline."

Which would explain the pull Harry had felt.

"Now that it's found you, Mister Potter, I rather suspect the wand won't give its allegiance to anyone else." Ollivander finished.

So presumably it wouldn't give its allegiance to Voldemort, Harry mused; that was good news.

"But there's not really an issue with the Headmaster continuing to have the wand, is there?" Minerva asked anxiously.

"Oh, I dare say it will continue to work for the Headmaster if not as well as it has done, as well as his previous wand." Ollivander said brightly. "He is a powerful wizard in his own right." His gaze moved back to Harry. "If you feel the wand is safer with him and wish to use another, well, that is a remarkable choice and perhaps only one who has Peverell blood could make – to refuse the power the wand offers you. But I would caution you that you may need the wand, especially in these dangerous times."

Ollivander held up a hand before anyone could say anything.

"I see the signs and I know the one who wields the brother wand to your own rises again." He gestured. "I suspect he is behind your tournament entry."

Harry looked helplessly at Sirius.

"If Harry is to face Voldemort," Sirius began, "which believe me will only be happening over my dead body, but ignoring that, you truly believe Harry using the Elder wand is worth the risk of it falling into Voldemort's hand?"

"I understand the concern, but regardless that I rather think that the Elder wand wielded by a Peverell would be practically invincible," Ollivander replied smartly, "there is the pressing concern that Harry's own wand would be useless against its brother wand."

Sirius stiffened. "Explain."

"When two wands containing magical elements of the same creature are set in opposition, there is a battle for dominance that takes place between the wands." Ollivander said swiftly. "The wands are locked until the stronger overcomes the weaker. At that moment, priori incancatem occurs with the defeated wand spilling out its secrets. A normal duel is out of the question."

"I can't use my wand in a duel with Voldemort?" Harry checked, a sinking feeling in his stomach because he liked his wand – he loved his wand – he didn't want to have to use a different wand if he was fighting Voldemort.

"I'm afraid it wouldn't do much except…" Ollivander spread his hands in lieu of repeating himself.

"Great." Harry muttered.

Sirius reached over and clasped his shoulder briefly. "At least thanks to Mister Ollivander we know now." He turned to the wand-maker. "Thank you."

Ollivander waved away the gratitude. "There is one tale that if you truly need it, the Elder wand would come to its rightful master by calling it with a simple thought." He smiled. "If the Elder wand ever does come into your possession, Mister Potter, I would appreciate the opportunity to examine it."

Sirius and Minerva hustled Ollivander away in some gracious manner that didn't make it look like they were hustling him away, leaving Harry contemplating the information Ollivander had imparted.

"We can get you another wand." Sirius's voice wrenched Harry from the tumbling single thought of 'what now?'

"I like my wand." Harry sighed and flopped back against the sofa.

"There's always the Elder wand." Sirius said, sitting down beside him. "And frankly we always thought you might have to use it since its one of the three Hallows and if they are the power he knows not…"

"Yeah." Harry murmured. "It's just…every time something goes right, something else seems to go wrong."

Sirius patted his shoulder, understandingly. "My advice is to focus on the positive."

Hermione.

Harry started smiling as he remembered their conversation; how she'd said she liked him; her absolute confidence in him.

"And there we go." Sirius said amused. "I recall your Dad had the exact same sappy expression." He got up. "Well, my work here is done. I'm going to call Remus and update him on the ceremony and everything."

Harry pushed himself out of the sofa and made for his room. He had some reading to do on magical creatures and then…and then he had a date to plan.
