# The Forbidden Library

Two weeks into the term, and Alex was starting to find their rhythm. Classes were challenging but fascinating. Spells that once seemed impossible were beginning to make sense. But something was nagging at them.

The Forbidden Library.

Every student had heard the warnings: *Never enter the Forbidden Library. The knowledge within is too dangerous. The books have minds of their own.*

But warnings had never stopped Alex before.

It was past midnight when they slipped out of the dormitory, their wand casting a soft glow ahead. The halls of the Academy were silent at this hour, and their footsteps echoed as they made their way to the oldest part of the building.

The door to the Forbidden Library was unlike the others. It was made of dark wood, covered in runes that seemed to shift and move when looked at directly. Above it, carved into the stone archway, were words in an ancient language Alex didn't recognize, but somehow understood:

*Knowledge is power, but power without wisdom is destruction.*

"Here goes nothing," Alex whispered, and pushed the door open.

The air inside was thick with the smell of old paper and something else—something metallic, like ozone after a storm. Shelves stretched into darkness, books floating between them, their covers opening and closing as if breathing.

*"New visitor,"* a voice whispered from the shadows.

Alex spun around, wand raised. But there was no one there. Just books. And shadows that seemed to move.

*"Seeker of knowledge,"* the voice continued, and now Alex could see it—a massive tome hovering in the air, its pages turning without hands. *"What do you wish to know?"*

"I..." Alex hesitated. What did they want to know? There were so many questions. But one stood out. "Why was I chosen? Why me?"

The book's pages rustled, and an image appeared on one of the open pages—a symbol. The same symbol that had appeared during the sorting ceremony. The vortex of stars.

*"Because,"* the book replied, *"you are connected to something greater. Something that has been lost. And the Academy needs those who can find it."*

"Find what?" Alex asked, but the book was already closing, sinking back into the shadows.

*"That,"* came the final whisper, *"is for you to discover. But beware—the answers you seek may cost more than you're willing to pay."*

Alex backed out of the library, their mind racing. As the door closed behind them, they couldn't shake the feeling that their life at the Academy was about to get a lot more complicated.
