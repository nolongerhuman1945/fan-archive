"NO!" Hermione screamed as they landed on the floor in the Hogwarts' infirmary.

The wards of the school responded instantly to the magical intrusion and locked down the infirmary wing.

Hermione staggered to her feet and hurried to the door, attempting to get it open by shaking it. When that didn't work, she pulled out her wand and aimed it at the thick wood.

"What the HELL are you doing?" shouted Ron, grabbing her wrist and pulling it down sharply so it pointed at the floor.

"Let go of me!" She wrenched out his grasp. "I have to get out of here and back to London! I have to get back to Harry!" She didn't care that her voice sounded too high and too panicky.

Ron stared at her furiously. "DON'T YOU THINK WE ALL WANT TO DO THAT?!" He pushed his hands into his wild red hair.

"THEN WHY ARE YOU STOPPING ME?"

"Because the wards have been activated and you aiming a spell at the door might kill us." Luna said matter-of-factly, wandering up to stand beside Hermione.

"Oh." Hermione's body slumped with disappointment and hard on its heels was the overwhelming urge to burst into tears.

Sirius was dead.

Harry had just lost Sirius – had just lost his father.

And instead of allowing her to comfort him, he had sent her away. He had broken up with her – to protect her, yes, but *broken up* with her.

He was alone and she was…

She covered her face with her hands.

Ron patted her awkwardly on the back. "He didn't mean it, you know. He's just…"

"Trying to protect me, I know." Hermione rubbed at her watery eyes and frowned. "He doesn't get that I don't need protecting! I should be with him."

"No." Luna spoke before anyone else could. She was gazing into the far distance, seeing something nobody else could. "He needs this time to forge shield and sword and spirit…to prepare for the battle ahead because ultimately he and he alone will face the Dark." She blinked suddenly. "What did I just say?"

Hermione opened her mouth to respond and snapped it shut again as the wooden door opened, revealing an impressive looking battle-ready Dumbledore, with Professors Snape and Moody just behind him.

"Professor!" Hermione said hurriedly, jumping in before anyone else could. "You have to help us!"

Dumbledore frowned heavily at them while Snape sneered.

Moody motioned at her. "Before we do anything, you'll explain how you lot managed to crash through the Hogwarts' wards!"

"Well," Ron exchanged a quick look with Neville, "that wasn't us so much as…" he grimaced, clearly unwilling to give up Harry as the culprit.

"Potter." Snape immediately jumped to the right conclusion.

"It wasn't Harry's fault!"

"Harry was just…"

"We needed to find out what happened and…"

"You can't blame Harry!"

"Harry just sent us away and…"

"I think Hogwarts has pretty colours."

A sharp whistle cut through their combined babble and yanked their attention back to the concerned looking Headmaster.

"Miss Granger, perhaps you could explain from the beginning what has happened." Dumbledore said calmly.

Hermione took a deep breath and nodded, her hair bouncing lightly around her shoulders. "When Neville came back from the infirmary, we went to see Harry…"

Dumbledore's rheumy eyes sharpened brightly. "You were there when I visited with Professor Trelawney."

"In Harry's room, yes." Hermione agreed, refusing to feel guilty for seeing Harry despite Dumbledore's advice. "When you left, well…"

"Professor Trelawney went kind of funny and had a vision." Ron supplied helpfully, stepping up to stand close to Hermione in support.

"Something to do with someone who had worn a cursed object dying and being reunited with their loved ones, Professor." Ginny added.

"Harry thought," Hermione had to stop and take another breath as tears stung her eyes again at the memory of Sirius lying dead, "Harry thought it meant Sirius."

Ron's hand patted her awkwardly on the back.

"So…"

"We went to Saint Mungo's to check on Sirius." Neville said gravely.

"You did WHAT?" Snape spluttered indignantly.

"We went to London." Neville repeated, his shoulders straightening as he met Snape's furious glare. "Nobody," he shot a look at Dumbledore, "was telling Harry anything."

"Typical Potter!" Snape snapped. "Of course he had to know and so off he went to London!"

"Snape!" Moody growled. His magical eye whirred and spun before fixing on Neville. "That isn't the end of it, is it, lad?"

Neville shook his head. "We found out…" he stopped and Hermione could see him struggle to find the words, "we found out Sirius is dead."

The adults blinked at them in shock.

Dumbledore looked dumbfounded. "I'm afraid that's impossible."

"It's not impossible!" Hermione argued. "We saw…we saw for ourselves!" The memory of Sirius's broken body on the gurney had her covering her face as though she could block the sight from her memory.

"Miss Granger," Snape sneered, "Black is currently alive and well. Whatever you think you saw…"

"Don't talk to her like that! WE SAW THE BODY!" Ron roared, white with rage, his freckles standing out in sharp relief.

"Professor Snape is quite right. You might have seen a body but it could not have been Sirius." Dumbledore asserted calmly. "Last night, it was quickly ascertained that Saint Mungo's was not secure nor could the healers there deal with his injury, thus Sirius was taken to the Valley clinic by Doctor Jordan. Professor McGonagall has gone with him."

They all stared at him.

"But, but…that can't be true," Hermione said, "because if Sirius is in the States then whose body did we see in the morgue and…OH MY GOD, HARRY!" She raised her stricken gaze to Dumbledore, "Harry thinks Sirius is dead!"

"Where is Potter?" Snape demanded.

"He was just so upset…" Hermione said in a rush.

"He sent us back here." Neville interjected. "We have to get back to Saint Mungo's and find him!"

"I will go and retrieve Harry." Dumbledore said crisply.

"Not without me." Hermione said, raising her chin and glaring at him. "If you had just told Harry when you saw him this morning, none of this would have happened!"

A part of her was appalled at how she was speaking to her headmaster but she was just furiously angry with Dumbledore.

"I'm coming too!" Neville said firmly. "I'm sworn to Harry's service! I can't leave him there! It would be against the oath I took!"

"Me too." Ron insisted.

Dumbledore held up his hand and sighed. "Very well. Severus, you'll come with us and protect the children."

Nobody looked happy at his pronouncement but putting up with Snape was better than being left behind.

Dumbledore whirled around and marched to the infirmary floo. He took a pinch of powder and threw it into the flames. "Saint Mungo's!"

Snape went through first and Hermione followed after him. He held her back when she would have stormed to the morgue and as she waited for the others, the strange chaos surrounding her filtered through her worry.

A large number of Aurors were gathered in the reception, a gawking and babbling crowd around them, peering into the huddle as they tried to get more information.

"What's going on?" Hermione murmured.

A passing healer overheard her and paused. "Someone wrecked the wards!" She hissed and hurried off.

"I wonder who?" Snape jeered.

Hermione glared at him.

The others stumbled through the floo and went as equally wide-eyed at the sight of the reception area.

Dumbledore strode through and immediately caught the attention of one of the Aurors.

"Professor Dumbledore, sir!" The dark skinned man called out with relief. "It's good to see you. The wards…"

Dumbledore nodded briskly, his eyes taking on a faraway gaze as he magically took in the damage. "I will confer with Directors Croaker and Bones to re-establish them. Where…"

"Morgue, sir." The Auror gave a grateful smile. "Epicentre of the magical disturbance was there."

Hermione followed after Dumbledore, Ron falling into step beside her. Luna and Ginny flanked Neville, while Snape brought up the rear.

The morgue fairly glimmered with magic.

"Oh my dear boy!" muttered Dumbledore as he passed through the double doors. The inside of the morgue was filled with people – Amelia Bones, Bertie Croaker and Remus among them.

Remus caught sight of their entry immediately and did a double take. He strode over, a furious scowl on his face. "Where is Harry?" He glared at Dumbledore.

"Now, Remus…" Dumbledore began soothingly even as he sketched a privacy bubble that encased the room and its occupants.

"Don't!" Remus growled, his eyes flashing amber. "His magic is all over this room! What was he doing here and where is he now?"

"He's gone?" asked Hermione before Dumbledore got a chance to derail her question.

Remus snapped his eyes to hers. "What happened, Hermione?"

"I think we would be…" Dumbledore began.

"Harry overheard Professor Trelawney say that someone wearing a cursed object would die and he thought it was probably Sirius so we all came with him here to find out and, well…" Hermione waved a hand towards the once-again covered up body across the morgue. "We thought that was Sirius."

Remus glowered at Dumbledore and took a step toward him. "Why would Harry come here when you were supposed to tell him that Sirius was at the Valley clinic?"

Dumbledore's cheeks tinted red. "I had to spend most of the morning with Hagrid after that appalling article this morning and I thought it was perhaps best to wait until I had more time to explain."

Hermione noticed Snape shoot Dumbledore a disgusted look before he hid it behind his usual sneer.

"Of course you thought best." Remus shook his head.

"Why didn't you tell him?" Ron blurted out.

Hermione folded her arms and pierced Remus with a pointed stare as she registered the truth of Ron's accusatory tone. "Yes," she added briskly, "why didn't you? You said something about how you were going to tell Harry Sirius was gone when Harry and I eavesdropped on you earlier!"

"What? When?" Remus looked confused before the moment Hermione was referring to seemed to come back to him. "I meant how was I going to tell him Lawrence was dead on top of his being told Sirius was gone – gone to America!" He waved his hands at them. "And why would you kids think Lawrence Appleby was Sirius anyway?"

"It looked like Sirius." Ron jumped in before Hermione could reply.

Remus frowned heavily, his eyes dimming down to a brown before flashing amber again. He went back to the body and ran a diagnostic spell.

Amelia watched the results appear and swore. "Pettigrew was here again?"

"This is a…" Remus started but cut himself off as his eyes landed on Hermione and the other teenagers around her. He drew in another breath. "So, let me summarise." He pointed at Dumbledore. "You decide not to tell Harry the truth about where Sirius is…"

"I was with Hagrid and didn't want to worry Harry when I couldn't be with him." Dumbledore said defensively.

"…and Harry," Remus continued on, "worried regardless of your efforts, and attempted to come and see Sirius for himself. Only Sirius isn't here and the rat sees Harry and sees Sirius isn't here and decides to take advantage by using Lawrence's body to mimic Sirius." He waved his hand at Hermione. "Have I got this right?"

Hermione nodded quickly. "Harry was very upset. His magic…he sent us all back to Hogwarts! He didn't give us a choice!"

"And so we have a distraught, powerful and grief-stricken wizard missing!" Remus glared at Dumbledore and he wasn't the only one. "But more importantly, we have a young boy who believes his father is dead!"

"To be fair, I could not have anticipated this." Dumbledore pointed out calmly, although there was a faint hint of chagrin in his blue eyes.

Remus gave a huff. "But you could have prevented it!" He pushed a hand through his hair. "I have to find Harry!"

Amelia placed a hand on his shoulder. "We'll find him, Remus."

Ron clicked his fingers. "What about Dobby? Won't he know where Harry is?"

Remus's eyes widened for a moment before he called for the elf.

Dobby didn't appear.

Remus frowned heavily. "Mumby!"

The Black elf assigned to the School House popped into the morgue with a guarded expression. "Mumby bes here, Steward."

"I need you to tell me where Harry is, Mumby." Remus instructed tersely, almost vibrating with impatience.

Hermione found herself holding her breath as she waited for the elf to answer.

"I cannot answer, Steward. Orders from the Heir." Mumby said, waggling his ears in distress.

"Harry thinks Sirius is dead." Hermione jumped in. "Can you tell him he isn't and to come home?"

Mumby's round protruding eyes blinked rapidly. "Elves cannot be sensing Lord Black."

"That's because Lord Black is in a time bubble." Bertie explained patiently. "You can inform Harry that his father is at the Valley clinic."

Mumby started rocking side to side. "Heir orders all but Dobby from his side. Only the Lord can overrule."

"DAMN IT!" Remus snarled and whirled away.

"Thank you, Mumby." Amelia said softly. "I believe you can return to your normal duties."

"Well, this is unfortunate." Dumbledore sighed.

"UNFORTUNATE?" Remus stomped back up to Dumbledore. "THIS IS YOUR FAULT!"

"Perhaps rather than laying blame we should focus on retrieving Potter." Snape stepped up to Dumbledore, drawing Remus's attention.

Hermione rubbed her head and tried to think how they could find Harry. "What about the family magic? Is there any way that we can find him through that?"

"If Sirius was able to call it, yes," Amelia informed her briskly, "but I'd rather not wait until he's back before we try to find Harry."

That wasn't what she had meant, Hermione fumed silently. Of course they couldn't wait for Sirius to return in a week before trying to find Harry.

"Merlin help us all if we haven't found Harry by the time Sirius returns!" Bertie pointed out quietly.

"The family magic," Snape pondered out loud, "won't he realise that he was wrong about Black's demise when he does the inheritance ritual?"

"I very much doubt that Harry will attempt the inheritance ritual, Severus." Remus retorted. "He's grieving for Sirius. Confirming his succession as Lord Black is going to be the last thing on his mind."

Snape looked at him sceptically but bowed his head in acceptance.

Ginny tentatively raised her hand. "Wouldn't he have gone back home? I mean, that's where I would go if…"

Remus brightened at the thought and snapped his fingers. "I'll check."

"Good." Amelia said crisply. "We'll reconvene in one hour at Hogwarts if you haven't found him by then."

"I want to come with you!" Hermione stepped in front of Remus as he made to leave.

Remus gently shook his head. "You said Harry sent you back to Hogwarts? I'm sure he was trying to protect you and that was right; you should all be back at Hogwarts." He placed a hand on her shoulder. "I'll find him." Without another word, he marched out.

Amelia sighed and rubbed her head. "Let's hope Harry has gone home. We can't publically declare Harry missing and do a large scale search. It'll play right into Voldemort's hands and cause chaos."

"Agreed." Bertie sighed tiredly. "We should start thinking about how we can find Harry if he isn't at any of his usual abodes."

"Well, let's put our thinking caps on and reconvene in my office in an hour." Dumbledore asserted authoritatively.

"That should include us too." Neville waved a hand at the group of teenagers.

They all turned to look at him and Hermione realised with a start that her friend had assumed his role as Harry's second. His face was set in determined lines, a stubborn cast to his jaw.

"Now, Mister Longbottom…" Dumbledore began.

"Headmaster, this was your doing." Neville stated forcefully. "Had you told Harry the truth as Remus clearly asked you to, Harry would never have come here. He would never have been tricked into believing Sirius was dead – *we* would not have been tricked! And just because you're our Headmaster, don't think for a moment that you're in charge here and making the decisions!"

"That's enough, Longbottom!" Snape snarled angrily.

Neville ignored him, continuing to glower at Dumbledore. "Harry being missing is an alliance matter. He's sworn to protect us and we are sworn to protect him!"

"He's right." Amelia stated firmly. "The alliance – well, key members of the alliance at any rate – will need to be informed."

Dumbledore made a dismissive hand wave. "I'm sure young Remus will find Harry shortly and we can put this whole thing behind us without anyone else having to be involved."

Amelia regarded him evenly and Hermione admired her rock-steady calm in the face of Dumbledore's natural authority. Amelia didn't challenge him aggressively but she made it clear that she wasn't afraid of him and wasn't simply going to bend to his will either.

"We'll wait until we meet in your office in an hour." Amelia made a circular gesture that encompassed the teenagers. "All of us. If Harry is back…fine." She smiled humourlessly. "If he's not then we'll inform those who need to be informed."

"Very well." Dumbledore said, clearly irritated that he wasn't getting the final say.

Hermione didn't care about his annoyance; she was just relieved that she wasn't going to be shut out of looking for Harry. And as she turned to follow the Headmaster back to the floo, she only hoped that Remus would find Harry and that it wouldn't matter at all.

o-O-o

Somehow Harry had expected it to be much harder to get to the Potter vault but when he'd shown up at Gringotts and made his request to a teller, it had been surprisingly easy.

He quickly filled a pouch with money. He was going to need money to travel, to buy food…all the necessities of life. Surviving had been the only coherent thought he'd had once he'd apparated away from the hospital.

That and he had to move fast. The sheer amount of magic he'd expended at the hospital would soon alert everyone to his running away…

No.

Not running away.

He wasn't running away like a coward. He was staying away from his friends and family to protect them.

Retreating.

Regrouping.

The terms from the military books Moody had made him read as part of his leadership training echoed through his head.

He'd ensured he was hidden. He'd called Dobby to collect a few key items for him – namely, his invisibility cloak, his photo album and some clothes. He'd also called the Black elf that had taken over from Kreacher and ordered that his location not be disclosed to anyone; that the elves themselves stay away from him so they would be safe.

Just like he'd sent his friends to safety.

Ron and Hermione were going to be furious with him, probably Neville too, but they were safe and that was all that mattered.

He wouldn't let anyone else die trying to protect him.

His eyes caught on the trunks from Godric's Hollow.

Too many people had died already.

He shivered; a tug on his spirit and his gaze drifted to land on the small innocuous box that sat on the shelving.

The Resurrection Stone.

Without thinking, he raised his hand and the box zipped across the space and landed in his palm. He struggled with the storm of emotion that swept through him like a tidal wave. He could talk with Sirius…he could talk with his parents…

He closed his eyes and wrestled the temptation back. He pushed the small box into a pocket and stood up to leave.

His exit from Gringotts was swift and he immediately apparated again.

His bedroom at Privet Drive was freezing.

The house had been abandoned by the Dursleys and bought immediately by Sirius. He'd told no-one except Harry that they owned the property.

Harry's mind slipped back to the Summer…

He was always happy to spend time with his new father and thrilled that their Sundays had been designated for father-son quality time. He sensed Sirius was a little nervous about their trip that day though and wondered why.

"*Hold on." Sirius said. "We're going to apparate to our destination." He placed his arm around Harry's shoulders and Harry leaned into Sirius's solid premise.*

*They landed in the back garden of Harry's old house.*

"*Phew." Sirius said brightly. "Was a bit worried I wouldn't remember it right."*

*Harry tensed. "Why are we here?"*

"*Good question, Pronglet." Sirius said, leading him up to the back door and waving his wand at it so it opened. "We're here because this just became our newest property."*

"*Why?" demanded Harry as they stepped into the kitchen.*

*It had been left with the Dursleys old furniture and belongings as part of the deal Sirius had agreed with Petunia on Harry's custody had him providing a sum of money for her to furnish and decorate her new property.*

"*Because it's an asset." Sirius said with enough gravitas that Harry knew he was serious.*

"*An asset." Harry mumbled unbelievingly.*

"*Your Mum created a blood ward around this place; a very strong pretty impenetrable blood ward that kept you safe for years. It's weak right now because you've barely lived here for most of the last year and your Aunt has moved out – and its strength was predicated on you living here with your Aunt; renewing its energy through the spell of protection your Mum cast at her death." Sirius spun his wand in his hand absently. "Now there's no way that we're having you live here with your Aunt but I did some digging and…there is another way to renew the protection."*

"*How?" Harry asked, curious despite himself.*

"*Blood." Sirius grimaced. "We have to unfortunately reinforce the original binding with our blood. Your blood and mine as you living with me is now what anchors your protection."*

"*But why keep this place at all?" Harry asked tentatively. "I don't get it. I mean, we have our house and the Manor and all the other properties so…why have this place?"*

"*Because very few people would ever think to look for you here." Sirius said patiently. "Nobody except Dumbledore and a few others even know the address of where you used to live and certainly those who do wouldn't think you'd ever return here since you hated your life here. A bit like how nobody thought I'd go back to Black Manor this time because I hated it there."*

*Harry began to understand.*

"*People will look in the obvious places." Sirius continued. "They'll look at places you considered safe and home. This place isn't one of those and that's why it's perfect. Not only that, but only you and I even know we own the property now. I've already added some minor wards – notice-me-not, muggle repelling, that kind of thing. Once we've renewed the blood ward, this will make a good bolthole if we ever need it."*

"*Only you and me?" Harry frowned. "Remus doesn't know?"*

*Sirius shook his head. "I trust Moony, Harry, I do. But we need somewhere even he doesn't know about. This place," he waved a hand around the kitchen, "is our secret."*

And it had remained their secret.

Harry swiped at his eyes and when he lowered his hand Dobby was there in front of him, sat on a small trunk with Hedwig perched on his shoulder.

Dobby sniffed at the sight of the bedroom and snapped his fingers. Instantly the broken furniture was mended, the stale air gone and a magical warmth covered Harry like a blanket.

Hedwig flew to Harry's shoulder and she began nuzzling his hair. He felt his resolve waver under her comforting touch.

"Don'ts you be worrying Master Harry Potter." Dobby said solemnly. "Dobbys be taking care of you."

"You should leave, Dobby, and…"

"I bes a free elf and I bes choosing to remain with you as your Paddy would have wanted. Yous be hungry and tired. Too much magic. You'll need to sleep." Dobby ushered him to the bed and a moment later Harry was in pyjamas and being tucked into bed.

Horizontal, the last of his energy drained out of him. He was tired…so tired. The pain of his loss snaked through him again and he gave a sob, turning his head into the pillow. He felt the tug of Morpheus and gave into it, tumbling into sleep and darkness where the pain couldn't reach him; where he could dream that he hadn't lost Sirius…

o-O-o

The newspaper was thrown across the kitchen with a snarl and Peter quickly rearranged his expression into one of abject servitude. He had known as soon as he had read the rag with its report of a magical catastrophe at Saint Mungo's the day before being nothing more than a result of a cursed body being blown up that the Dark Lord was not going to be happy. Especially when he'd been so gleeful at Peter's retelling of what had really occurred.

"REPORT!" The Dark Lord snapped at Dennis Travers.

Travers drew himself up but his expression was respectful and filled with deference. "The traitor Karkaroff reports that the boy is back at Hogwarts and is currently being kept in protective seclusion in his rooms along with Black."

"You don't believe it." The Dark Lord's red eyes bore into his minion.

"The alliance kids have been sent home rather than staying on at the castle as planned." Travers shrugged. "If Black and Potter are there why do that? Something's not right."

"You believe Potter is still missing?" The Dark Lord probed.

Travers nodded. "Patrols this morning acted as though they were looking for something and the oaf left his shack to join them search the Forest at the Headmaster's urging. He's been shut in there since Skeeter's article yesterday about his being half-giant."

"Hmmm." The Dark Lord turned to Barty who was kneeling by his chair and pushed a childish hand through Barty's hair. "Has Severus made contact?"

"No." Barty said, leaning into the touch in a manner that made Peter's gut churn.

"Contact him." The Dark Lord ordered. "He will know the truth."

Barty immediately leaped to his feet, eager to prove his worth after his previous failure.

The Dark Lord nodded approvingly at Travers. "You've done well, Dennis. Return to Hogwarts and continue to watch."

Travers gave a small bow and disappeared into the Vanishing cabinet.

"Fetch a map." The Dark Lord motioned at Peter and Peter knew better than to dally. He hastened to the sideboard and pulled out an old Encyclopaedia that had been left there. It had a map of Britain and he swiftly flicked to the right page and placed it in front of the Dark Lord.

The Dark Lord pointed his wand at the book and muttered a spell under his breath. A yellow light sprang from the wand's tip, skittered around the map and slid off the page to dissipate harmlessly on the floor.

"Interesting." The Dark Lord mused contemplatively as his snake slithered around his chair. "Potter is well shielded or somewhere unplottable but he is definitely not at Hogwarts." He tapped his fingers against the edge of the dining room table.

"Shall we search for him?" Peter inquired, unable to stay silent any longer.

The Dark Lord's eyes slid to Peter briefly before returning to the map. "No. I think not." A wave of his wand had the book sent back to the sideboard. "We shall let him remain broken and hiding, grieving for his father, looking over his shoulder in the belief that I will try to find him when he is so vulnerable. What better way to torture him for our ritual?"

"Brilliant, Master." Peter simpered.

The Dark Lord's lips twisted into a mockery of a smile. "And I believe we shall ask Severus to pass on that we are hunting for Potter though. It should keep Dumbledore and his minions running around and allow us time to set things up for the second task."

Peter smiled tightly and nodded. It looked like he had been right in his decision to remain loyal to his Master. Potter had run away like the scared child he was and the Dark Lord was once again proving why he was the most powerful wizard around.

o-O-o

Remus blew out a frustrated breath as he dropped into the chair by the fire.

The parlour in the School House was small but cosy and Remus needed its warmth and familiarity while he took a moment to rest. He rubbed at his tired eyes.

It had been five days since Harry had gone missing; five very long, very tiring days of searching with no sign of Harry.

It looked increasingly likely that they weren't going to find Harry before Sirius came home. Remus closed his eyes. He wasn't looking forward to telling Sirius Harry was missing. Guilt suffused him again.

He should gone to Hogwarts as soon as Sirius had disappeared in the whirl of the portkey to the Valley clinic. He should have ensured Harry was comforted and fully informed about Sirius's healing and condition.

Sirius was going to kill him.

Why had he trusted Dumbledore to tell Harry what had happened? Why had he chosen to stay at the hospital in the hopes that Wormtail would reappear and they could trap him? Hadn't he learned from what had happened in 'eighty-one when Sirius had made the same choices?

It wouldn't happen again, Remus swore to himself. He only hoped Sirius and Harry would forgive him for his poor decisions.

The thought made him pause for a moment as he realised deep down he expected that when Sirius did return, Harry would be found. Of course he believed that, Remus mused; Sirius would turn over every rock in Britain to find Harry. Padfoot wouldn't rest until he had found his son and brought him home.

Home.

The memory of searching Griffin House and finding nothing raced through his brain again. He had been so sure Harry would have sought sanctuary there…

The sound of the fire flaring caught Remus's attention; the flames turned green and a moment later Tonks stepped out.

She looked frazzled; her pink hair was tied back into a braid but tendrils had come lose and drifted haphazardly around her face. There were purple circles under her eyes giving truth to her exhaustion. Her Auror robes were wrinkled and creased as though she had been wearing them for days.

"Hey." Tonks said and fell into the opposite chair with a groan. She raised her hand and gave a half-hearted wave. "Anything?"

Remus shook his head. "Nothing. You?"

It was Tonks's turn to shake her head. "The Director's got more patrols out in the Alley, around Hogwarts and Hogsmeade, and at the hospital but so far nothing. The Underage magical sensor hasn't activated either so wherever he is he's either not doing magic or he's heavily shielded. Has there been no sign of him at any of the properties?"

"I've alarmed every property in the Black and Potter estates here in Britain." Remus said. "He's not taking refuge in any of them." He sighed. "None of his friends have had any contact with him. I know Amelia was hoping that by sending them home to their parents it might tempt him into approaching them but…"

"Are you sure they aren't lying, protecting him?" Tonks asked carefully.

Remus nodded. "Hermione's too upset that he's missing for him to have contacted her. Ron is angry and resentful that he hasn't been contacted – it's written all over his face. Neville's too stoic when asked; he's trying to keep it together because Harry isn't around." He sighed. "I don't think Harry's close enough to either Luna or Ginny to have approached them and besides…he sent them all back to Hogwarts to protect them. He's staying away from everyone to protect them."

That had been clear once they'd had the chance to examine Hermione's memory of what had happened at Saint Mungo's in Dumbledore's pensieve.

A noise behind them had them both turning.

Sian stepped into the room, tying the belt on her silky purple dressing gown tighter. "You both look wiped out. Have either of you eaten?"

Both Remus and Tonks replied negatively at the same time.

Sian motioned for them to follow her into the kitchen.

"Where's Mumby?" Remus asked slumping onto the bench at the kitchen table, Tonks sitting beside him and leaving the opposite bench free for Sian.

"Back at the Manor." Sian said, heading to the Aga and pulling on heavy oven mitts. "I thought it was best to have someone there in case…"

Remus gave her a grateful smile, oblivious to Tonks's annoyance at the other woman's thoughtful action.

Sian took out a casserole dish from the lower oven and set it on the centre of the table. A moment later, she had cutlery and plates in front of them and was spooning out a thick beefy stew. She set bread on the table beside it and without asking, she poured them both a glass of Merlot before sitting down with her own glass of wine.

"Thank you, Sian." Remus said, his stomach growling appreciatively at the taste and scent of the food. He hadn't eaten since a quick chocolate bar at lunch time.

"Yes," Tonks waved her spoon, "thank you."

"I hope Harry has something to eat." Remus said, feeling a little guilty as his hunger abated.

"Dobby is with him." Sian pointed out. "He's pretty devoted. I can't see him letting Harry starve."

"He won't." Tonks agreed. "That elf is too obsessed with his Master Harry Potter." She twirled her spoon around. "And we know Harry has money, Remus."

It was the one thing that they had been able to verify; Harry had gone straight to Gringotts and visited the family vault. There had been a small withdrawal of funds – too small to sustain Harry for long but enough to tide him over for about a month.

"What I find weird is that any mail owl won't leave with a letter for him." Tonks added. "He's somehow managed to convince them that they're not to give him anything."

"Is Hedwig still missing?" Sian sipped her wine.

"Nobody's seen sight nor sound of her." Remus scooped up some stew. "The current theory is she's with Harry." He let a small smile touch his lips. Somehow knowing the owl was with Harry reassured him; Hedwig seemed to consider Harry her charge. She would look after him.

"So," Tonks said despondently, "we know nothing. There are no leads, no reports of him, no signs of contact. It's like he's disappeared into thin air."

"Which is good, isn't it?" Sian said softly. "If we can't find him, neither can…can you know."

"Voldemort." Remus stressed the name and shot Tonks a look not to argue with Sian. He gave a short sharp nod. "And in some ways, you're right. Severus says that they're looking but haven't found him yet. He's leaking false leads to them to keep them off track."

He pushed his plate away and picked up his wine. It was horrifying that the only good news they had was that the bad guys were no closer to finding Harry than they were.

"Mum and Dad are devastated." Tonks murmured. "They think they should have offered to have stayed with Harry when they heard about Sirius being injured." She grimaced. "I should have stayed with Harry."

"Dumbledore should have just followed his bloody instructions and told Harry the truth." Remus countered before his ire deflated. "In truth, there's plenty of blame to round. *I* should have been with Harry."

Sian reached over and clasped his hand. "This wasn't your fault either, Remus."

Tonks placed a hand on his shoulder. "Sian is right. The only people to blame here are Dumbledore for not allaying Harry's worry in the first place causing him to run off to Saint Mungo's, and the rat for taking advantage of Harry's suspicion that Sirius was dead and tricking him into believing it for real."

Remus was going to kill Wormtail.

Slowly.

The wolf inside him was in complete agreement.

"What's the plan for tomorrow?" Sian asked. "Are you going out searching again?"

"I'm going to talk to Petunia." Remus noted their blank looks. "Harry's Aunt."

Tonks pulled a face, her hair cycling through colours and giving away her inner thoughts. "Why? You don't think Harry would have gone to her? Seriously?"

"She's his Aunt." Remus said simply. "She and that horrible family of hers might have treated Harry appallingly but they were to all extent and purposes the only family he had for years." He took a sip of his wine as he tried to put his thoughts into words. "I don't think he's with her but I do think she might know where he would have gone."

"I doubt that woman has any idea where Harry might have gone in the magical world." Tonks argued fiercely.

"But she might have some idea of where he'd hide in the muggle." Sian rejoined fiercely. Her eyes flashed across to Remus's. "That's why you want to talk with her, isn't it? To see if Harry is hiding in the muggle world?"

"Partially…" Remus said carefully, trying not to let his discomfort at the two women glaring at each other show. "She may well have some thoughts about the muggle world and if so…I'm hopeful that they'll translate to the magical. I don't believe Harry is in the muggle world. Dobby and Hedwig would be difficult to explain."

"You really think she'll know anything of value?" Tonks said sceptically.

"She knows Harry." Remus repeated. "As much as I hate to admit it, she was his caretaker for the first thirteen years of his life. And yes, she might not have wanted to have anything to do with him, but she raised him and on some level she knows his habits – where he goes when he's upset, what he's likely to do…" he sighed heavily again, "or at least I hope so."

Tonks patted his shoulder and gave a sympathetic grimace. "Well, we've got to have hope, right?"

Remus nodded and felt Sian's fingers tighten around his. He drew away from the comfort of the two women, uncomfortable with their support and feeling decidedly undeserving of it. "Thank you for the food, Sian. I'm going to turn in now."

He wouldn't sleep again; would stare up at the ceiling as he had done every night since Harry had gone missing. Perhaps tomorrow they'd find Harry and then he could sleep again.

o-O-o

*31* *st* *December 1994*

Harry woke between one breath and the next, sitting up and gasping for air.

He sat, panting softly for a long moment, before he rubbed a hand over his face and tried to remember what had happened.

Everything came back to him in a rush and he slumped back against the pillow, huddling back into his bedding.

Sirius was dead.

And he was back at Privet Drive because nobody would look for him at his old muggle house. Because Sirius had bought it as a bolthole for him. Because Sirius had cared about him, loved him and Harry had never told him…

The tears seeped out of his eyes and into the pillow.

There was a gentle flap of wings and he felt Hedwig landing on the pillow behind him; her beak nuzzling into his hair as she gave what comfort she could.

He missed Sirius so much.

A small pop gave away Dobby's entry and Harry wasn't startled when the elf's hand patted his back awkwardly.

"Alls is being alright, Master Harry Potter, sir." Dobby murmured quietly.

Harry shook his head. "Nothing's going to be alright again, Dobby." He shifted carefully, aware of Hedwig beside him. She hopped up onto the bedside table and Dobby handed him his glasses as he got himself upright. He felt exhausted still.

He inched out of bed and to the bathroom. Standing under the warm spray, memories filtered through the fog of tiredness…of waking up before…fed warm soup and urged to drink sweet hot chocolate…of a cool cloth against his forehead…of being ushered into the bathroom, into a shower and clean clothes…fresh bed-linen scent as he slid back to sleep again…

He felt a momentary flush of embarrassment that Dobby had taken care of him so much. He finished up his shower and dragged on a bath-robe. He wandered back into his old bedroom and found Dobby waiting with a tray of food.

Harry pushed his embarrassment to one side and met Dobby's kind eyes directly. "You've been taking care of me."

The tiredness that still dogged his limbs was familiar; magical exhaustion.

"Dobby will always bes taking care of his Master Harry Potter." Dobby stated with complete conviction.

Harry nodded as he got back into bed. "Thank you, Dobby." He looked around the room; at the thin daylight filtering through surprisingly cheerful curtains – Dobby had obviously redecorated while Harry slept. "How long was I…"

Dobby silently handed him a stack of newspapers as he settled the tray across Harry's lap. "Dobby bes getting you breakfast."

It looked good and Harry's stomach growled appreciatively. He dug into the scrambled eggs and buttered toast while flicking open the paper on the top of the pile. It was dated the day after Boxing Day and the headline gave away the cover story for what had happened at Saint Mungo's. He scanned the articles and couldn't find anything about Sirius's death. He tossed it aside and reached for the next newspaper. Several newspapers later and he'd pushed the tray away, frowning as he considered the lack of any kind of announcement about Sirius.

He was certain that they would have reported it…

Maybe the War Council or the alliance had decided not to publish the information to the press yet, Harry mused. Maybe they'd decided it wasn't politically the right time or would give Voldemort too much of an advantage. It was probably why there was nothing about his own disappearance…

His gut twinged with guilt as his gaze snagged on a small article in one of the early papers about how the rest of the Hogwarts students had returned home. He wondered what had happened to the plan for everyone to stay on at the school. Maybe they'd gone home out of respect for Sirius.

His heart ached a little at the thought of Hermione. They'd had plans for New Year's Eve, nothing very special just a promise to spend it together, to kiss at the change of the year. But it was New Year's Eve and he couldn't spend it with her. He had to protect her and if that meant he couldn't be with her then that was just the way it was.

His fingers brushed over the article again and he pressed his lips together.

"Dobby," Harry said, "is the last paper today's paper?"

Dobby nodded eagerly.

"So, it's the last day of the year." Harry murmured. Tomorrow would bring a new year.

A year without Sirius.

Harry rubbed his head tiredly and picked up his abandoned cup of tea. He sipped as he tried to come up a plan…any plan.

What would Sirius want him to do?

Well, it didn't matter because Sirius wasn't there anymore, Harry thought angrily. But his anger drained away quickly overwhelmed by the pain he felt at not having Sirius in his life.

It came down to what Sirius had been trying to teach him and what they had planned already; his responsibility to the Houses of Black and Potter…being prepared to fight Voldemort…not giving in and coming out fighting in the tournament…

So, he sipped his tea, first thing was his responsibility to the Houses of Black and Potter.

He shouldn't have just run off and left them. Yes, he'd done it to protect them but he owed them more than silence. He sighed and pushed a hand through his messy hair. Hedwig spread her wings and looked at him pointedly.

"Letters, I should send letters." Harry paused. "Or a letter."

Maybe to Augusta. She would be the de facto adult leader of the alliance with Sirius gone. Of course, if he only sent a letter to Augusta, Neville would be pissed, Hermione hurt and Ron incandescent. And he probably owed a letter to Moony who was no doubt as devastated as Harry was himself about Sirius's death.

He blew out a frustrated breath. OK, so he was writing letters to all of them. What could he tell them? What exactly was his plan? To track down Voldemort by himself and confront him once and for all?

It was a plan.

Of sorts.

The alliance could focus on the last piece of the Treasure Hunt and he would take care of Voldemort. But he needed everything to happen before the second task in February or he'd end up having to go to Hogwarts to take part in the tournament no matter what.

He probably needed something more than 'taking care of Voldemort' as a plan too; possibly maybe more than 'finding Voldemort.'

He scratched his forehead absently. One thing at a time.

Harry's eyes strayed to his Heir ring. He should probably consider doing the inheritance ritual but he couldn't face it. Not right then.

Tomorrow, Harry decided; he would do it tomorrow at the beginning of the New Year.

But first he needed to say goodbye to Sirius, to his father. There'd been no report of a memorial or funeral but Harry was certain that they wouldn't have waited for him – and if they were, there was no way that he was going to be able to go.

No, he'd say his goodbyes in private.

He glanced over to the small wooden box on his old desk, felt the tug in his spirit as its contents called to him once again.

And he just knew how he was going to do it.

o-O-o

Remus stared at the package of letters that sat on the coffee table as Augusta directed everyone to their seats. He was perched on a chair, almost falling off the edge, his eyes pinned to the large envelope.

Hermione sat down in the chair next to him; her mother offering Remus a sympathetic smile as she sat on the arm of her daughter's seat and placed a comforting arm around Hermione's shoulders. Ron sat next to Neville on the sofa, the two of them both wearing determined stubborn expressions that gave them an air of solidarity. Arthur and Molly Weasley took the second sofa, while Dumbledore conjured himself an armchair; Andromeda followed his example. Both Richard and Amelia Bones eschewed a seat, choosing to stand, and Augusta took the remaining chair.

Augusta cleared her throat. "Just after lunch, Hedwig appeared in the garden. She flew in, dropped the envelope and flew out again before we could attempt to stop her."

"You're certain it was Hedwig?" Amelia asked tersely.

Augusta bristled. "I recognise the owl and we've checked the envelope just to be safe. There's no sign of tampering." She motioned at Remus. "Perhaps you could do the honours?"

Remus practically pounced on the envelope. He opened it and tipped it up. A cascade of letters fell out and onto the table. Remus scooped them up and handed them out.

Hermione clutched hers tightly, hope and fear shining out of her brown eyes. Ron's face settled into grim satisfaction. Neville looked relieved while Augusta looked surprised when Remus handed her the final one while he kept his own clutched in his hand.

"It's addressed to the Potter alliance." Augusta said slowly.

"Read it." Richard encouraged.

Augusta unfolded the letter. "Dear friends, I should start with an apology for leaving the way I did but with Sirius's death I can no longer justify placing others in danger when I am sworn to protect you." She stopped abruptly before she swallowed hard and continued. "I want you to know that I will defeat Voldemort; I don't ever want you to doubt my commitment to that. I will return to Hogwarts for the second task but it is my hope that I find him before then."

Remus paled rapidly. Merlin! Harry was intent on going after Voldemort by himself.

Augusta cleared her throat noisily. "I need the help of the alliance to continue to maintain the political pressure on those that would support Voldemort; to help me find him and a way to defeat him. I know Sirius is a great loss in our fight but I hope we will honour his memory by continuing his plan. I will be in touch. Harry." She carefully folded the letter and handed it to Amelia.

"That poor boy." Dumbledore murmured.

Remus suppressed the wolf's urge to growl at him. Instead, he turned to Harry's friends and motioned for them to read their letters. "You don't have to share but please; read them."

It was Ron who tore into his first. He quickly scanned it, frowning then smiling broadly. "He's good. Says he wants us to continue planning for the second task and making sure things stay the same at Hogwarts."

Neville nodded, reading his. He looked reassured, more confident and Remus was certain that Harry had given him the task of leading the Heirs.

In contrast, Hermione gave a sob and ran out. Her mother gave an apologetic sigh and went after her.

Ron gazed after them unhappily. "I guess he didn't say he was being stupid and ask to get back together with her."

Harry had hurt Hermione badly, Remus surmised. It was going to be a mess when the young wizard did return.

He slowly unfolded his own letter and scanned the message…

"*Dear Moony,*

*I feel terrible leaving you to handle everything with Sirius's death and looking after the Houses. I know you're grieving for him just as much as I am and… I'm safe.*

*I'm somewhere Sirius found for me.*

*Dobby's looking after me and Hedwig…*

*I'll keep writing I promise.*

*I'm so sorry, Moony. It's all my fault and…I promise I'm going to make it right.*

*Snitch."*

"Oh, Harry." Remus murmured softly, his emotions churning wildly. His heart ached for the loss that was written in every word, the grief that seeped through the paper and through his fingers and into his bones. He felt a renewed rush of guilt that he'd trusted Dumbledore to inform Harry; hadn't been there for Harry once again.

*Harry was safe somewhere Sirius had found for him.*

The thought suddenly stampeded through his head.

Of course.

Sirius had planned for every contingency. He had known Harry might need a safe place to go at some point in their fight against Voldemort; somewhere secret from everyone including Remus. The contrast with Petunia was marked since Harry's aunt had expressed little knowledge of Harry's habits when he was upset beyond him doing weird magic.

"Remus?" Andromeda prompted gently.

"Sirius gave him somewhere safe to run to," Remus replied without looking up, "he's there."

"Well," Dumbledore clapped delighted, "all's well. As soon as Sirius returns, he can retrieve Harry and…"

"And we'll be lucky if Sirius doesn't kill the lot of us for letting Harry think he was dead in the first place." Remus pointed out dryly. He deliberately met Dumbledore's eyes and the old wizard did at least have the grace to look ashamed.

But Dumbledore was right. There was nothing more to do than wait until Sirius returned. Another day and Padfoot would be back in England, hopefully fully healed from his experience at Christmas. Remus felt frustrated that his own efforts to find Harry had been so unsuccessful but it was gratifying to know that Sirius's contingency planning had worked; Harry was safe.

"I don't think there's anything more we can do." Remus said out loud.

Amelia huffed out an irritated breath of her own, her eyes raking over Dumbledore before she nodded. "Cornelius will be relieved to hear that Harry's well-being is confirmed." She shook her head a touch as though to shake the thought of the Minister of Magic away. "I've already sent a portkey to the Valley clinic for Sirius to use as soon as he's released. It will return him to my office at the Ministry. I thought it was best he find out about Harry on relatively neutral ground."

"A good idea, Amelia." Dumbledore demurred.

Remus suppressed the urge to roll his eyes – Amelia didn't.

"This could all have been avoided, Albus." Amelia stressed. She pushed away from the mantelpiece and glanced at her brother and Augusta. "I take it the alliance will wait for Sirius's return before doing anything else?"

Augusta gave a slow nod. Her fingers traced over the letter she held. "Knowing he is safe…" she sighed, "we'll wait for Sirius."

"Although I think one of us should talk with Sirius when this calms down a bit." Richard said firmly. "I can understand why Sirius gave Harry the bolthole at the beginning of the Summer but things have changed…Harry should view the alliance as his safe place to come."

"Exactly." Molly nodded enthusiastically. "Harry's just a young boy. He needs supervision and emotional support! What he must have gone through these last few days!"

"Harry doesn't want to put any of us in danger." Neville countered, defending his absent friend.

"And it's not like he's thinking straight." Ron jumped in. "He's grieving!"

Molly bristled. "Ronald! That…"

Remus raised a hand bringing an end to the debate. "I don't disagree that Harry should view his new extended family and his allies as his first port of call now when Sirius isn't around, but the boys are right." He rubbed at his forehead tiredly. "Harry's in a great deal of pain, blaming himself for Sirius's death and…in his grief, his immediate thought is that he doesn't want to be the cause of anyone else getting hurt. Hence why he's pushed us all to a distance." And in the case of his school friends, that pushing had been very literal.

"Well, he's wrong." Hermione's voice sounded from the doorway. She marched into the room, stopping by her previous seat. "You can't tell me you think he's right? We should all get to make the decision for ourselves!"

"Actually," Amelia stated dryly, "I, for one, am glad he reacted the way he did that day at the hospital. It's all too likely that Pettigrew and maybe some of Voldemort's other minions were close by. If Harry hadn't sent you all back to Hogwarts, we may have ended up with another abduction attempt or worse."

Neville's face blanched white and a quick look at Augusta had Remus convinced that she was in complete agreement with Amelia. Molly placed a hand on Ron's shoulder and Remus knew she was also contemplating how close the kids had come to being seriously hurt.

"You'll get the chance to talk to Harry about it when he gets home." Miriam Granger reminded her daughter with the air of something that had been oft repeated.

"Maybe I don't want to talk with him." Hermione muttered and sat down, crossing her arms over her chest.

Remus looked over at Miriam with a grimace. Yes. There were definitely going to be stormy times ahead for the teenagers. He smoothed a hand over his letter. They would count themselves lucky that Harry would be back for there to be stormy times, Remus mused. And regardless that he dreaded Sirius learning of what had happened, he couldn't wait for Padfoot's return…for Padfoot to make it all alright again.

o-O-o

The sun shone brightly above him but Sirius ignored it in favour of glowering out at an undefined point in the majestic scenery. He was back in his Padfoot form. It had taken him a while after waking from the three week-long healing coma he'd been placed in to be able to manage the shift without excruciating pain, but he was damned if he was going to let Crouch or anyone deny him the comfort of his animagus form.

Sirius fidgeted, his claws sinking into the ground below him. He'd felt as weak as a kitten when he'd woken up three days before and hadn't been able to argue with Minnie's sound logic that the Valley had been the best place for him to receive treatment. But he had also chafed badly at the news that no-one had considered letting Harry accompany him. Sirius missed his son so much it ached.

More than that, with each day that passed he couldn't shake the nagging feeling that something wasn't right with Harry; that Sirius was needed back home. It was the reason why he'd sought the spot on the mountain where he and Harry had talked once when he'd gone for his morning run.

Footsteps alerted him to the approach of Noshi and Sirius didn't move. Sirius wasn't surprised Noshi had come looking for him. The healer had personally overseen Sirius's treatment. Sirius gave an internal sigh and morphed back to his human shape.

Noshi smiled and sank to the ground to sit beside him. "Thank you for changing back, my friend."

Sirius huffed audibly. "Minnie told tales on me, didn't she?" The old professor had been hovering worriedly over him during his stay at the clinic.

"She is concerned about you." Noshi said calmly.

Sirius knew it was futile to argue Minnie's concern wasn't justified. He surrendered gracelessly. "I had another nightmare."

Noshi's eyes sharpened thoughtfully. "The same one?"

Sirius nodded. "Every night the same thing."

Noshi motioned at him. "Tell me about it."

He had already described the dream once before but Sirius acquiesced to the request with a tilt of his head.

"Harry is missing and I'm desperately trying to find him." Sirius swallowed hard, remembering the ache in his heart that had echoed through his dream and into the reality of waking. "And I find him in the cemetery by his parents' grave. I'm running as fast as I can but before I can reach him, Death appears and..." He sighed heavily. "And that's when I wake up."

Noshi regarded him contemplatively. "You are worried about your son; to dream of him is natural. He has a heavy destiny to face."

"If this was just one dream, one night, I might agree with you." Sirius murmured. "This feels more." He shook himself. "I think something is wrong *now*."

And as he put it into words for the first time, he was struck by the sense that he was right; something was wrong and his son needed him.

"You were involved in a traumatic situation prior to waking here," Noshi said, "are you certain that isn't simply preying on your mind?"

"No." Sirius retorted firmly. "Something is wrong. I just know it!"

Noshi nodded slowly. "You are mostly healed, I would prefer you to stay a while longer, but I believe returning home and reassuring yourself of Harry's well-being will accelerate your remaining healing."

"Is there any way I can borrow one of the amulets that allow you to overcome the time bubble?" Sirius asked.

Noshi raised his eyebrows a touch. "You believe you need to return before a week has passed outside?"

"My gut is screaming at me that I need to get home right away." Sirius said, standing up.

"Then we will get you home." Noshi said.

Things moved fast after that. It was only a few hours later that Sirius found himself hugging Minnie goodbye in Noshi's office.

Minnie stepped back and patted his arm consolingly. "I really hope you are wrong about this, Sirius."

"So do I," murmured Sirius. He accepted the amulet Noshi handed to him with grim satisfaction.

"I cannot guarantee how much time will have passed on the outside; how much time you may gain back." Noshi cautioned.

Sirius nodded in understanding. He knew deep in his gut that the amulet would return him to when he was needed.

Noshi passed him a portkey. "I understand it will take you to Director Bones's office."

Sirius appreciated that someone had considered the logistics of getting back to Britain. He grimaced apologetically at Minnie. "I'll get a replacement sent straight away."

"As soon as it arrives," Minnie said, "I will follow you."

Noshi sighed. "I am sorry that I was only able to secure one amulet for you."

Sirius waited a moment while Minnie assured Noshi that it was fine. "I should go."

He placed the amulet around his neck and with a final goodbye headed out of the clinic. He walked until he felt the tell-tale tingle on his skin of passing through the magical time barrier. He paused and checked the date; New Year's Eve. He had been gone almost the full week. He frowned and activated the portkey.

The tug on his naval was wrenching and he was wincing when he landed in Amelia's office.

Sirius realised he should wait but the urge to find his son was too great. He made for the floo and headed straight to the School House; he could walk up to Hogwarts from there.

The cosy Hogsmeade house was filled with welcome warmth when Sirius stepped into it. He brushed the remains of the floo powder from his shoulders as he made for the front door, stopping abruptly as he almost collided with Remus in the doorway of the parlour.

"Moony!" Sirius stared at him with bemusement. "What are you doing here? Why aren't you with Harry?"

And the certainty that something was wrong grew in the face of Moony's guilty expression.

Sirius drew himself up and glared at his oldest friend. "Where is Harry?"

Remus tried to usher Sirius into the parlour but stopped when Sirius refused to budge.

"First things first," Remus said soothingly, "Harry is safe." He raised his hands as though to ward Sirius off but mostly to stop him from talking. "He's at the bolthole you arranged for him."

"Why?" Sirius demanded. The house at Privet Drive was meant to be used only in a dire emergency...

Remus sighed tiredly. "Did Minerva explain why you were at the clinic?"

Sirius nodded impatiently. "Saint Mungo's couldn't treat me..."

"And Wormtail paid you a visit." Remus added. He pushed a hand through his hair and Sirius absently noted how weary Remus looked. "Harry was safe at Hogwarts so I left it to Albus to tell him what was going on and I stayed to see if the rat showed again."

Sirius suddenly understood where the story was going. "What did the old coot do now?" He snapped.

"More what he didn't do." Remus muttered, pushing his hand through his hair again. "He didn't tell Harry anything."

The growl was completely involuntary and unavoidable; Sirius felt strangely connected with his inner Grim after the fight with Rookwood, and his inner Grim was ready to tear Dumbledore to pieces.

"Trelawney was looking after him – Trelawney!" Remus continued. "Harry overheard her having a vision where she said someone would die and…and he thought it was you so…" he sighed, "he broke out of Hogwarts with his friends and went to Saint Mungo's."

"This isn't explaining how he ended up running away!" Sirius said impatiently.

Remus waved at him to calm down. "The rat saw him at the hospital, realised Harry thought you were dead somehow and…"

"And?" prompted Sirius, a dread gathering in his gut.

"And made Harry think you really had died." Remus finished at a rush. "Wormtail transfigured Lawrence Appleby's body to look like you."

Sirius felt the panic start to rise like a tidal wave inside of him. If Harry thought he was dead… "He thought I was dead so he ran to the bolthole?"

"Yes." Remus nodded. "Sent the rest of his friends back to Hogwarts first, somehow breaking up with Hermione in the act, and…I think he ran to protect the rest of us. He sent us letters today and he pretty much admitted that protecting us was his motivation." He motioned at Sirius. "He thinks you died because of your association with him so…"

"Buggeration!" Sirius said furiously. It was a complete mess but all that mattered was his son was at Privet Drive thinking Sirius was dead; was alone and hurting, grieving for no reason. He pushed past Remus and headed for the door. As soon as he was clear of the wards he would apparate.

"Where are you going?!" Remus hurried after him.

"Where do you think I'm going?" Sirius snapped without turning around to look at him. "I'm going to get Harry."

"I'll come with you." Remus offered immediately.

Sirius whirled around and glared at him; anger at his old friend storming through him suddenly and overwhelming his urge to see Harry. "You'll stay here."

Remus looked crestfallen and guilty. "Sirius…"

But Sirius was too angry at him. He stabbed a finger in Remus's direction. "I trusted you to stay with Harry if I couldn't be there for him! I thought we were trying to avoid the mistakes of the past and – and bloody hell, Remus, you just committed the same mistake I did trusting Dumbledore with Harry's safety! And where is Harry again? Hurt and alone and…" he choked on his words, turned around and stormed out of the house, aware that Remus wasn't following him.

He felt a twinge of remorse for yelling at Remus but his mind was too preoccupied with his need to get to Harry. The wards passed over him as he jumped over the garden gate and he immediately focused to apparate.

The back garden at Privet Drive was in darkness. The muggle houses next door were lit up with bright green and red Christmas lights. No such effort had been made at Harry's old home; the house was shrouded in darkness. It was late – almost midnight, Sirius assured himself, even as he bounded for the door. Harry had probably decided just to go to bed early. He entered the back door almost at a run. The kitchen was empty and the living room clearly hadn't been lived in for a long time and Sirius wondered if Remus was right and Harry was there. He made his way upstairs, hope and foreboding warring inside of him. Something told him to ignore the rooms that had once been allocated to the Dursleys. He made straight for the smallest bedroom.

He opened the door and froze.

"Master Harry Potter's Paddy!" Dobby rushed towards him and wrapped himself around Sirius's left leg. "You is being alive!"

Sirius continued to scan the bedroom for any sign of Harry even as he dropped a hand to pat the elf kindly on the top of his head. Harry had clearly been living in the room; the desk was cluttered with the remains of letter writing paraphernalia; the bed was made but had clearly been used; clothes were neatly stacked in the wardrobe; and, Hedwig's perch had been placed near the window.

"Where's Harry, Dobby?" Sirius asked urgently, stooping to push the elf away from his leg and look him in the eye.

Dobby's ears waggled – a sign of distress. "Master Harry Potter went to say goodbye to his Paddy."

"Where?" Sirius pressed.

Dobby fidgeted unhappily. "Cemetery. Dobby scared and Master Harry Potter told Dobby to stay behind."

Cemetery…oh Merlin.

Sirius felt his heart stutter in his chest.

Harry was at the cemetery.

Just like in his dream.

He raced out of Privet Drive. He wouldn't let anything happen to Harry. His nightmare was not going to come true, Sirius swore to himself. He wouldn't let Death have Harry.

o-O-o

Harry transformed back into his human form with a small sigh of relief. Hedwig had carried him in his Snitch form most of the way to the cemetery on her back, and tucked up in her feathers he had been surprisingly warm and comfortable. But he had flown some of the distance and his body felt sore and tired. Of course, Harry mused, some of it could simply be his lingering magical exhaustion. He hadn't made it better using his animagus form but he hadn't wanted to take the risk of being spotted by either ally or enemy, and Snitch allowed him to travel about inconspicuously.

He had his invisibility cloak with him too and he was glad of the extra warmth as he wrapped it over his other clothing of heavy denim jeans, a thick black cable sweater and a short black corduroy jacket. The air was bitterly cold. He was regretting eschewing the black woollen hat and gloves Dobby had tried to press upon him and as he cast a new warming charm on himself.

He glanced around the cemetery. It was empty and he figured that most people were tucked up inside their homes celebrating the New Year. Shadows drew strange patterns on the icy ground between the headstones and a brief look upwards had Harry frowning at the beginnings of a fall of snow; small flakes drifting down from the heavy cloud above that obscured the moon.

Harry shook himself and cast another spell to keep the snow off him. He didn't want to get wet. He aimed another spell at Hedwig, perched on a nearby tree, and she hooted appreciatively.

It seemed odd that only a week before he'd been there with Sirius, both of them saying goodbye to Harry's parents. Now, Harry was back only to say goodbye to Sirius himself…

Harry blinked back tears. He reached into his jacket pocket and took out the wooden box containing the Resurrection stone. He unholstered his wand and pointed it at the lock, muttering the spell under his breath.

Nothing happened.

He tried again.

The lock shook but didn't open.

Harry frowned, frustration curdling in his gut and stinging the backs of his eyes. All he wanted was to say goodbye; just to say goodbye! Was that too much to freaking ask?!

His magic surged up to the surface and swirled around him, sending the invisibility cloak flying from his shoulders like Superman's cloak.

He snorted and hurriedly reached to tug it back around him. He was no Superman. He breathed in shakily and wrestled his magic back under his skin.

Think, Harry told himself briskly. Why wouldn't the lock open? It had obviously been locked by someone powerful…someone like Dumbledore or Bertie. He had the power to overcome their spells, he knew he did, but…but he couldn't force that amount of power through his usual wand. He wasn't certain his second wand would be any better either and it was a moot argument as he didn't have it on him.

It was exactly like the problem with the collar that Sirius had been forced to wear by Crouch, Harry mused. He had needed the Elder wand to unlock that and…and he needed the Elder wand to open the box. The problem was that the Elder wand was with Dumbledore and Harry wasn't foolish enough to go back to Hogwarts to ask him for it nicely; he figured Dumbledore would lock him into Gryffindor tower to keep him safe or maybe lock him into the Headmaster's office…

He shook his head and put his own trusty holly wand away.

What was he going to do?

What was he…wait.

Hadn't Ollivander said he could call the Elder wand to him? He frowned heavily. He couldn't remember whether it was Ollivander or Remus or someone else but who had said it didn't really matter. What mattered was whether it would work.

Harry breathed in deeply, closed his eyes and centred himself as Noshi had taught him over the Summer. He reached inside himself and found the tendrils of magic that signified the bond between himself and the wand. And he reached…called out with his mind…

*I need you.*

There was a strange tug as though he was pulling something toward him and a moment later, the touch of smooth wood against his palm almost made him jump; the wand was in his hand.

It had worked.

He could call the Elder wand to him.

Harry's heart pounded in his chest; nerves and excitement warring with trepidation. He shook off his tumultuous thoughts about being able to call the wand and focused on unlocking the box. It sprang open easily when he cast with the Elder wand. He tucked the wooden box back into his pocket and held the stone.

He wasn't sure what to do but the stone sang in his hands just like the wand. He could feel it reaching out with cold fingers to envelope his magical core, settling against the binds of the wand with something that felt like relief and welcome.

Focus, Harry thought determinedly, closing his eyes once more; he needed to focus. He wanted to say goodbye to his father, tell him that he loved him, and that he was sorry that he had never told him. He wanted to see again the man who had been a father to him…

The silence of the cemetery penetrated his concentration. There wasn't a sound. No trees rustling; no wildlife moving; no snow landing with a quiet hush.

And it was cold.

A different kind of cold to the bitter winter chill that he had felt when he'd arrived. This was colder and warmer and…something was there in front of him.

Harry opened his eyes warily, and they went wide with shock.

The shade of James Potter stood in front of him; almost translucent, a flickering glowing being that shimmered against the dark backdrop of the cemetery's shadows.

Harry drank in his Dad's image. His father was young; the age he had died. The dark mop of unruly hair that they shared thanks to their genetics fell over his Dad's forehead and against the wire round frames he wore. A warm smile creased his father's worried face.

"Dad?" Harry breathed the word out in a stream of mist.

"Hello, Pronglet." His father's smile widened but the look in his eyes remained sad.

Harry shifted awkwardly, moving his weight from one foot to the other. It wasn't that he didn't want to see his Dad but… "I, uh, I mean…I wasn't expecting…*you*?"

His Dad nodded with understanding. "You wanted Padfoot."

"It's not that I don't want to see you!" Harry hurried out. "It's just that…"

"Padfoot is the father you know." His Dad said. "He's the one you think of when you think of a father." He smiled again. "It's OK, Pronglet. It's why we made Padfoot your godfather. We knew he'd be there for you."

"Doesn't he…doesn't he want to see me?" Harry asked, an edge of desperation creeping into the words.

"He isn't dead, Harry." His Dad said softly. "Padfoot isn't here. I'm the only one on this side who has died who was a father to you."

Harry reeled back as though he'd been hit. Padfoot wasn't dead? "But I saw him!"

"You were tricked." His Dad informed him briskly. He reached out as though to touch Harry but stopped just short of Harry's arm. "Believe me: Sirius is alive."

"Then where is he?!" Harry demanded. "And why didn't anybody tell me?!"

"I'm afraid we don't get all the news on this side." His Dad looked both apologetic and frustrated. "All we know is that he isn't here and so he must be alive. As for someone telling you…you've been hiding away from everyone for the past week."

That was true.

Bugger.

"I had to hide away…I…" Harry pushed a hand through his hair, tugging on it slightly as he tried to make sense of his thoughts. "I had to protect everyone."

"Because you thought it was your fault Sirius was dead?" His Dad said quietly. "You have to know it wasn't if it had happened and will not be if it ever does."

"He's in danger because of me!" Harry replied fiercely. "Because Voldemort's after me!"

"He's in danger because he's against Voldemort!" His Dad retorted just as strongly. "We were in danger because we were against Voldemort and your Mum and I…we placed you in danger because we were against Voldemort!"

The heartfelt words arrowed through Harry's angry defensiveness and he stared at his Dad blankly.

"Don't you see, Harry?" His Dad said softly. "We all made choices before you were born; your Mum and I and Padfoot and Moony to stand against Voldemort…Voldemort to come after you…Wormtail to betray us…none of this is your fault."

Harry's gaze dropped to the floor. He had heard the words his father had spoken but he was loathe to believe them.

"Tell me, Harry," his Dad continued, "do you blame us for putting you in danger?"

Harry's head snapped back up and he stared in shock at his Dad. He shook his head furiously. "Of course not! It wasn't your fault! It wasn't…"

"But it was." His Dad insisted. "I was the one who insisted on joining Dumbledore's Order. Your Mum and I were the ones who 'thrice defied' Voldemort and wouldn't join him. We were the reason why you matched the criteria in the prophecy."

"You couldn't have known though when you defied him." Harry pointed out. "And if Voldemort hadn't believed it…"

His Dad nodded. "But he did and he came after us and it's his fault that we died." His ghostly gaze held Harry's gaze fast. "Just like it's Crouch's fault that Padfoot was hurt; not yours. Do you understand?"

Harry nodded, willing on some level to accept his father's argument that the bad guys were to blame for others actually being hurt, but still unwilling to completely let go of his guilt and his viewpoint that people were better off without him – and if Padfoot was still alive that included Padfoot.

"Harry…Padfoot loves you." His Dad said quietly. "More than anything. He'd be incredibly hurt if you pushed him away – especially now."

Harry flushed red with guilt, the heat of his shame storming across his cheeks.

"Merlin, I'm pants at this." His Dad said suddenly, his hand going to his hair in a familiar gesture. "Lily is so much better at this kind of thing than I am. She was meant to take all the serious talks and I was meant to talk to you about Quidditch and girls."

Lily. His Mum.

He'd forgotten about the stone in his hand and as he thought about her, Lily Potter appeared; shimmering into view beside his father. The shade of her was as beautiful as the spirit that sometimes appeared to him thanks to the family magic; hair cascading down her shoulders, a friendly warm face with eyes that looked at him so lovingly...

"Oh Harry!" His Mum said breathlessly. "Look at you!"

"Mum." Harry whispered. He could hardly breathe; he was standing in front of their grave but his parents stood beside him; talking to him.

"He thinks everyone's better off without him, Lily." His Dad immediately ratted him out.

Harry winced under the sharp gaze that was immediately levelled at him.

"Harry James Potter," Lily said briskly, "that's complete rubbish and you know it!"

The matter-of-fact maternal scolding shattered through Harry's stubbornness like a battering ram and left him feeling foolish.

"But…" he began weakly.

"You really think Sirius would be better off without you in his life?" His Mum demanded. "He only pulled himself together because of you! He loves you!"

Harry grimaced because he knew she was right and he hated the thought of Sirius wasting away in Azkaban or as a fugitive.

"How would you feel if Neville thought he was bad for you and tried to push you away?" His Mum continued relentlessly. "Or if Ron was in trouble and didn't come to you? Or Hermione? Hmmm?"

Harry deflated. He rubbed his cold nose. "I'd hate it." He said out loud, answering his Mum's questions. "I'd want to be there for them and I'd refuse to believe that being close to them was a bad thing."

And he wouldn't blame them if he got hurt, he realised, any more than they would blame him. They were his friends and they wanted to support him.

His Mum nodded, seeing her message had seeped through. "They love you, Harry."

He'd hurt them when he'd pushed them away. He knew he had because thinking about it, he would be hurt if they had done the same thing to him. He hadn't meant to hurt them although he'd known his breaking up with Hermione had been going to hurt her. But he'd thought it was for the best and now…now he really didn't know what he thought.

"It's not easy knowing that because they're close to me, they're at risk, that they can get hurt." Harry said quietly.

"We know." His Mum murmured. "And we know that your childhood with your aunt – and believe me I will be having words with Petunia when she dies – and her loathsome family told you that everything that went wrong was your fault – but it's not. They were wrong. Very, very, wrong."

"Shutting other people out isn't the way to go, kiddo. You're stronger together." His Dad said. "You told the kids of the alliance that, and you're right. When the Marauders stood together, there was nothing that we couldn't accomplish and nobody we couldn't defeat. It was only when we fell apart that…well, things fell apart."

"I get it." Harry said with a sigh.

"Good." His Dad seemed to look beyond Harry for a moment, his expression shifting to fondness. "Because you and Padfoot make a great team."

Harry bit his lip feeling guilty again.

"Don't feel guilty," his Mum said quickly, wrapping her arm around his Dad's arm, the two of them leaning towards each other with an innate affection and intimacy that Harry drank in eagerly, "sometimes I think this was what was meant to be; you and Sirius. From the moment you were born, you had a connection with him…you always did love him." Her eyes slid momentarily to something over his shoulder but he kept his attention on her, and her gaze returned to him.

"I've never told him." Harry confessed. "That's…that's why I came here tonight. I wanted to use the stone and say goodbye and tell him…tell him I loved – love – him. And it's not that I don't love you guys, it's just…"

"He's your Dad." His parents said it in unison and Harry grinned weakly back at them as they beamed their approval at him.

"That's what we wanted, Harry." His Dad said firmly. "Well, not what we wanted exactly because that would be us raising you ourselves and not dying but the next best thing because Padfoot does love you to bits and we knew…"

"James." His Mum interjected exasperated. "He knows." She let her gaze slide over Harry's shoulder again and smiled somewhat smugly. "And now so does Padfoot."

And suddenly Harry *knew*.

He knew exactly where Padfoot was.

He whirled around and threw himself at the man standing just behind him.

Sirius caught him and hugged him hard, his arms wrapping about Harry's shoulders even as Harry wrapped himself around Sirius, tears falling of their own volition down their faces as they embraced the reality of each other.

"Pronglet." Sirius kissed the top of Harry's head.

Harry eased back a smidgen but only a smidgen. He didn't really want to let go at all. Sirius was alive and warm and alive and there and *alive*…

"I thought…" Harry managed to choke out.

"I know, Pronglet." Sirius said, smoothing a hand over his back. "Moony told me. But I'm fine. Yes, I was a bit battered but Noshi healed me right up, and I came home as soon as I could."

Harry shuddered and squirmed closer to Sirius again, wanting to feel his warmth, hear his heartbeat and the steady rise and fall of his breathing; all the signs that told him the undeniable truth that Sirius was alive.

"Don't leave me!" Harry said desperately. "Don't ever leave me! Promise!"

Because he'd thought Sirius had died…but if he had died and Harry had been on his own…but Sirius hadn't died and Sirius wasn't going to die – not if Harry had anything to say about the matter…

Without realising it, with that last thought, ancient magic long spelled into three wondrous artefacts reached out and invisibly twined around Sirius, anchoring the older wizard's life to Harry's own even as Sirius moved to look him straight in the eye.

"Pronglet; I promise that I am going to do all I can to be with you for a very long time. I promise that I am going to try and be there when you graduate Hogwarts; when you tell me there's a girl you want to marry; when you hand me your son and tell me he's going to be called Quaffle."

Harry gave a snort of laughter remembering the teasing Sirius always gave him about his Marauder nickname being Snitch.

"I promise." Sirius ended softly. "And I expect you do the same."

Harry gave a quick nod. "I promise."

Sirius pulled him in for another firm hug and Harry was luxuriating in the proof of Sirius's existence when he felt the other man tense up.

Harry peered up at him and saw Sirius's gaze fixed on…fixed on the shades of Harry's parents, who had remained quiet during his and Sirius's reunion.

"Prongs." Sirius said shakily. "Lily."

Harry shifted until he was standing beside Sirius, his own arms still wrapped around Sirius's waist while Sirius kept an arm over Harry's shoulders, tucking him into the shelter of his body.

"Padfoot." His Dad smiled fondly at the man who had once been his best friend.

"I can't…I just can't say how sorry I am about…" Sirius stuttered out.

"The rat's fault not yours." His Dad said interrupting.

"Please don't tell me we have to have the 'it's not your fault' talk with you too, Sirius." His Mum joined in. "You're supposed to be the adult."

"You know me, Lils." Sirius replied shakily, making an attempt to banter.

Harry squeezed his lightly, supporting him, knowing how hard it must be for Sirius to see them again, talk to them again.

"And it's alright, Sirius, that Pronglet loves you," his Dad said, "like we said, if we can't be with him, then we're glad that it's you and that he loves you; that you love him."

Harry felt Sirius relax, a deep breath that eased out of him in a long sigh.

"And you should know that I do approve of your plan," his Dad grinned impishly and Harry could see the mischievous boy he'd seen in the memories he'd been shown, "didn't we agree as Marauders to take over the wizarding world one day?"

"First year," Sirius agreed with a choked voice, "on the train home." He stared at Harry's Dad and Harry wondered what the exchange was about. "You heard that?"

"We hear things." His Mum replied. She smiled. "I'm glad you get it, Sirius."

"Anything, Lily-flower." Sirius said sincerely.

Harry looked from one to the other confused. "Am I supposed to know…"

Sirius glanced at him and shook his head. "Just a conversation I had with your parents only I didn't think anyone was listening." He paused and stared at the shades of his friends again. "I'm not sure what's weirder; that or this."

And he was right; it was weird.

"I guess…" Harry felt the weight of the stone in his hand again, "we should probably say goodbye." A lump coalesced in his throat, hard and tight.

"We should." His Mum agreed. "The stone uses your magical energy to power pulling us over."

"Oh." Harry hadn't thought about that.

"All magic demands a price." His Mum said. "You're right about that, Harry."

"Do you know what the power is that he's meant to have to defeat Voldemort?" Sirius suddenly asked.

Harry straightened, interested in the answer but he could see his Dad was already shaking his head.

"Prophecies are strange things. There are always *possibilities*. Just like it could have been Neville Voldemort chose to mark and not Harry." His Dad replied, answering Sirius seriously and giving Harry a glimpse into the Lord Potter his father had been so very briefly. "Harry," his Dad waited until Harry looked at him, "you have more power than you realise; political, emotional, *and* magical. Any of it could be the power he knows not."

"I guess I was hoping for something more definitive as a reply, Prongs." Sirius sighed.

"I'm afraid we don't know anything for certain." His Dad said. "Only what we've said before; you're stronger together than you are apart so…"

"Stop pushing people away." Harry completed. He tightened his grip on the stone. "I shouldn't call you again, should I? Not like this."

"Cadmus could never say goodbye to his love." His Dad explained. "He held onto the stone until it drained him of his magic and he died."

"We don't want that to happen to you." His Mum said.

Harry glanced at Sirius, a silent question of whether Sirius was ready too passing between them.

Sirius gave him an answering nod. "It's time, Harry."

Harry looked over at his parents, drinking in the sight of them one last time. He remembered how he'd done the same each night when he'd sat in front of the Mirror of Erised; how lost he'd felt in the days after the Mirror had been moved. Letting go of the stone would create a similar ache in his heart but he knew it would be easier because of the man stood beside him, the weight of his arm around Harry's shoulders still providing comfort.

Harry pushed the Elder wand into a pocket while he took out the wooden box that had held the stone. He looked over at his parents again.

"Look after each other." His Mum said softly.

"We don't want to see either of you for a very long time." His Dad added.

"Goodbye, Lils and Prongs." Sirius murmured.

Harry couldn't speak so he settled for giving his parents a wobbly smile and nodding his farewell. He slid the stone into the box and they disappeared in a swirl of snow. Sirius tapped the lid shut with a finger and Harry pulled out the Elder wand again to lock it. He handed the box to Sirius.

"Maybe you should keep hold of it." Harry mumbled a little embarrassed that he'd succumbed to the temptation to use it. He swayed on his feet, tired suddenly.

"Maybe we should give it to Bertie to look after." Sirius replied with his own chagrin, steadying Harry without a thought.

Harry agreed. He rubbed a thumb over the wand he held and willed it back to Dumbledore while Sirius's attention was focused on the box. The wand complained a little but went, leaving behind the sensation of grumpy acquiescence to Harry's wishes.

A bell rang out and another.

Their attention moved to the church and Harry counted the bells as they marked out the midnight hour and the turn of the New Year.

Sirius wrapped his arm back around Harry and pulled him close again. "Well, not quite the way we planned it but…Happy New Year, Pronglet."

And it would be, Harry swore to himself. He was done being tricked and trapped and manoeuvred by Voldemort and his cohorts. Voldemort meant to hurt everyone Harry loved; that much was clear and if Harry truly wanted to protect them, he had to stand with them; had to fight for the people he loved until Voldemort was defeated and couldn't hurt anyone ever again.

It was time to end it.
