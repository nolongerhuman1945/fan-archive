**(****Evening: All Might’s UA Housing Unit****)**

  
  

“Holy shit…I mean, holy shit!”

Kyouka was leaning into Izuku on All Might’s couch, turning her head to look at him, “He’s been doing this for a while.”

They watched as Hisashi paced back and forth across the living room, muttering to himself as he tried to process everything. “My son has All Might’s quirk. My son has *All Might’s quirk!* My son and his girlfriend have All Might’s quirk. I’ve never heard of a quirk awakening like that, but I suppose One For All is already a fusion of two quirks, so everything I thought possible is already thrown out the window.*”*

Izuku nodded, turning his head to the armchair to the right, “Yeah, but at least he’s taking it a lot better than Torino.”

Gran Torino hadn’t said a word. From the moment he saw a couple violet sparks flicker off of Kyouka, he had put his head in his hands, eyes wide and unblinking, staring at nothing as reality crumbled around him. 

“True. Hey, All Might! I think we broke him, so you can probably come out now!”

*“Not risking it!”* Toshinori’s voice rang out from upstairs behind his locked and barricaded bedroom door. 

“You really think that door is gonna stop him!”

*“It’ll buy me time to jump out the window!”*

“Just get down here!”

*“...Ugh.”* They heard the loud grinding of Toshinori’s furniture sliding across the floor and the click of his door lock. He came downstairs, his pillows taped to his torso. “Just get it over wi-”

Torino suddenly launched from his chair, firing himself right at Toshinori. But, in a flash of light, Izuku grabbed Torino in the air, holding him back. “You fucking moron!”

“How is this my fault!” All Might screamed back. “I wasn’t even there! I barely even know what a quirk awakening is!”

“I-! Mm…I guess you’re right.” Torino craned his head back, glaring down at Izuku. *“...It’s your fault.”*

Izuku’s eyes widened, “W-Wait a second, hold o-”

Air shot out of Torino’s boots, spinning him around and kicking Izuku over the armrest of the couch. Kyouka caught him, gently lowering his head down onto her lap. She stroked his hair, patting his chest, “You good?”

*“Yeah…”* Izuku wheezed out, propping himself up onto his elbows. “I thought I was gonna die! Shouldn’t you be happy I had a back-up plan! Who else was I gonna give it to?”

“I-...” Sorahiko pinched the bridge of his nose, sitting back down with a groan. “Why can’t things just be normal? Please, I’m begging, just one normal thing.”

“C’mon, you know you’d just get bored,” Kyouka waved him off dismissively. “Besides, for once we’re actually a step ahead of All For One. We finally have a secret he doesn’t know.”

“Wait, wait…” Everyone turned back to Hisashi, seemingly broken from his trance. “All For One’s in Tartarus, severely injured, and practically on the verge of life support. Is he really still a threat?”

“As long as he’s breathing? Absolutely,” Toshinori nodded, ripping the pillows off of his clothes. “But, I doubt he’s going anywhere without Young Tomura’s help, and from what we’ve gathered he has no intentions of rejoining his master at the moment.”

Toshinori glanced down at Torino, watching his face fall at the mention of Shigaraki. He had already relayed to them what he learned from his talk with Tomura, in a weird way to soften the blow of the One For All news by giving him the worst news first. 

Toshinori sighed as he sat down on the couch armrest, “Torino, he-”  
  

“Just don’t,” Torino shook his head. “I don’t wanna talk about it. We knew Kotaro was dead, and if All For One wasn’t the one who did it, then who else could it have been?”

“Yeah, but it was a whole lot easier just assuming All For One did it.”

“Who says he didn’t?” Izuku cut in. “We just know what Shigaraki knows. All For One might’ve had his hand in it, at least in some way.”

“Maybe so, but that doesn’t change who directly did the deed.”

Kyouka sighed, resting her head on the back of the couch, “At least it sounds like it was an accident and that he regrets it. More proof that there’s something inside. He’s not a monster. Actually, thinking about it, do we know if he’s killed anybody besides them? Every person he’s threatened to kill, he’s let go. You, Bakugou, Nagant…”

“The Tartarus guards.” Everyone turned to Hisashi, who shrugged as he pocketed his hands. “They replaced the guards on Nagant’s detail, but all were left both alive and seemingly unharmed. It could be that he knows more bodies will make things more difficult rather than mercy, but that shows he has restraint.”

“Let’s not jump to conclusions,” Torino grumbled as he stood up. “We can cope all we want, but you can’t forget that All For One has had him under his influence his entire life, and we know how much All For One likes to work in the shadows. There’s no way to know everything Shigaraki has done.”

“Hey,” Kyouka cut in. “Being optimistic is a requirement on this team.”

“That was optimism,” Torino grunted at her, turning to Hisashi. “Tsukauchi is still working on the arrest warrants for the HPSC board, but I suggest you go ahead and at least get a plan outline started for what you’re gonna do first as acting president.”

Hisashi took a deep breath, but nodded, “I’m on it.”

Torino hummed, and began walking to the stairs, “Tsukauchi will be down here tomorrow morning to interrogate Hawks. He’s gonna need information from all of us, what we can give him anyway. Make sure Kaina is awake for it. I have a feeling we’re gonna need her to get through to him, with their shared experiences and all. We’re also gonna need everything Kaina knows about the League. I doubt it’s much, saying that she had her own apartment away from them. But, we’ll take anything at this point. By the way, are you gonna tell Mirai about all this?”

“Nope,” Toshinori shook his head.

“About which part?”

“Yes.”

Torino sighed, “Fair enough. I’ll see you all in the morning.”

Toshinori furrowed his brow, watching as Torino went upstairs, “Wait, but I only have one bed— And he’s gone. Okay. Couch it is. He’s gonna be making ‘old man noises’ all night.”

“Thanks for the reminder to keep my quirk on low tonight. Okay, next topic on the docket,” Kyouka clasped her hands together, turning towards All Might. “You and Lady Nagant.”

“Oh boy,” Toshinori sighed. 

“Look, I know you and Pixie Bob broke up, like only twelve hours ago. But, she did give you to green light to-”

“Whoa-Whoa-Whoa! Wait a second! I never told you we broke up.”

“...”

“Oh my God. Stop eavesdropping on people!”

“Moving on! Pixie Bob was right. You’ve been waiting almost twenty-years to be together.”

“I…Look, let’s get her settled first, alright? She’s been through a lot, and I still very much like Ryuko. Break-up still stings, so just give me a minute, okay?”  
  

“...You have one week.”

“Wh-?! C’mon!”

Izuku nudged her, “Kyouka…”

“What?! They’ve waited long enough! Seventeen-years of pining is insufferable. We pined for each other for what? A month? The only reason they didn’t get together in the first place is because of Yoda Eastwood upstairs.”

*“I heard that!”* Torino yelled from upstairs.

“Damn, I was hoping he had taken his hearing aids out by now. But, anyway, he can’t preach to us about how we shouldn’t wait for love and how it makes us stronger, and then proceed to not go after the love of his life because he’s scared.”

“Wh-?! Hey, I’m not scared!” Toshinori exclaimed back. Kyouka just deadpanned at him, and Toshinori sighed. “...Okay, I’m a little scared.”

“...”

“Pretty scared.”

“...”

“...Very scared. Whatever, can we please make sure we don’t have to send her back to prison before anything happens?”

“Mm…Fine. But, I think I speak for everyone when I say that nobody wants to sit here and watch you two not be together for any longer.”

“When did you become Young Ashido Junior?”

“Hey, she loves gossip about everybody. I only like making sure everybody I care about is happy. Do you know how much work I’ve put in with this one?” Kyouka asked, hand on Izuku’s head. “I know what I’m doing at this point.”

“She’s not wrong,” Izuku shrugged. “How exactly would we keep Ms. Tsutsumi here anyway?”

“W-Well…” Everyone turned back to Hisashi, who was rubbing his chin in thought. “As soon-to-be acting HPSC President, and with the more than dubious sentencing of Ms. Tsutsumi’s crimes…I suppose it’s within my power to reinstate her right to bail, and allow her to remain under house arrest until she can have a proper trial.”

Toshinori perked up, walking over to Hisashi, “You’d really do that?”

“I mean, we should run it by Principal Nezu first, but I’m sure he’d be more than happy to supply her housing. Maybe with some restrictions, but still.”

Toshinori smiled, hand on Hisashi’s shoulder. “You, my friend, are the gift that keeps on giving.”

Hisashi looked down, scratching the back of his head as his face bloomed red, “A-Ah, cmon. I-I don’t know a-about that…” 

“...So that’s what that looks like,” Izuku sighed, Kyouka chuckling as she ruffled his hair.

“Let’s just see how it goes first,” HIsashi cleared his throat. “I technically don’t have any power yet, but until your detective friend actually makes an official arrest, as heroes we’re allowed to keep her here as a hero's arrest.”

“I’ll call Nezu,” Toshinori nodded. “I’ll see if we can supply her housing. I’d prefer if she didn’t have to go into one of the holding cells. We might have to have someone guarding her, so it can seem more official…”

Izuku and Kyouka both shared a glance, with the former trying to hold back a chuckle, “You?”

Toshinori blushed, turning away with a shrug, “What? Of course not! No, no…I mean, if nobody else was available…”

The couple both laughed while Hisashi grabbed his jacket from the armchair, “Okay, I think we’ve teased him enough. We have a family dinner to attend.”

The couple shared a glance again, with Izuku holding back a sigh. This was the dinner they had to postpone due to the Hawks situation, the one to celebrate getting their licenses. Izuku had promised Mr. Aizawa that it would be where he told his parents about the fight with Bakugou. He had almost forgotten about it.

He felt Kyouka squeeze his hand. Izuku looked up at her, and she just brought their hands up and kissed his knuckles. 

Kyoutoku and Mika would be there, so this would be where they found out too. Knowing them, he hoped they would be more proud of their daughter than anything. They were always pretty adamant on Kyouka not taking shit from anybody. As long as she wasn’t the one that started the fight, he had a feeling they wouldn’t be too angry.

They’d probably focus their rage on Bakugou, which while Izuku obviously related, he would have to talk them out of pursuing anything. 

He hoped his…*episode* would be enough for them.

His mom?

He had already stopped his mom from going after Aldera before. But, this? 

…Maybe his dad could help hold her back.

They got up from the couch, heading for the door. Inko and Hisashi were still at the UA housing until their apartment was fixed from the attack, so the Jirous had offered to have the dinner at their place. With how his first interaction with the Jirous went, Hisashi almost felt like he was going into the belly of the beast.

The couple walked out the door, but Hisashi stopped, turning back to All Might, who was texting Nezu. “You coming?”

“Hm? Oh, I’m sorry. I thought it was a family dinner.”

“It is,” Hisashi shrugged. “Inko’s expecting you.”

“O-...Oh.” Toshinori put his phone away with a scoff, a smile creeping onto his face. “I…Yes. Yes, I’d love to come.”

“I don’t think Inko would accept anything less.”

“Of course,” Toshinori laughed as he grabbed his jacket, buttoning it up. 

As he started walking towards the door, Hisashi spoke up, “Uh…About that? The whole family thing…”

Toshinori’s eyes widened, quickly interjecting, “Oh, I would never overstep. I know with all the One For All stuff, I’ve been around for longer than you though. I’ve known your boy for almost two years, and I just-”

“No, no, it’s okay. I…I-I wanted to thank you, actually.” Hisashi pocketed his hands, pursing his lips. “If you’ve known my son for that long, then you already knew I wasn’t really around. Izuku already told me that there were people in his life that filled my shoes in my absence. I knew one had to be Mr. Jirou, that was a given. Now that I have context, it’s pretty easy to figure out that one of the others is you, and you’ve known him for even longer. I don’t know how much he’s told you about us, but I…I’m just happy he had someone. Especially you, I mean…*You.* You practically helped raise that kid just from your posters alone. Just…Thank you.”

“...Of course,” Toshinori reached his hand out to Hisashi, a determined smile on his face. “Your kid saved me, Mr. Midoriya. After my injury, I felt like a zombie walking around. I wasn’t myself. Lost my best friend, lost my sidekick, my time doing the thing I love most in the world was on a timer…I was losing hope in myself. Your son, in the matter of a single afternoon, brought me back. I’ll be whatever that kid needs, anytime he ever needs it. Now that he has you back, if you ever want me to step back-”  
  

“No, of course not. I’d never ask that of you,” Hisashi said as he shook Toshinori’s hand. “I’m the one who has to find room to squeeze in.”

“A-Ah, I was actually gonna say you’re gonna have to deal with it, cause I’m not going anywhere.”

“Pfft, hahaha! And, that’s where Jirou’s influence comes in.”

They stepped out, Toshinori shutting the door behind them. They began walking down the sidewalk, already seeing Izuku and Kyouka further up ahead, heading for the parking lot. “By the way, we stopped a corrupt government and are father-figures to the same kid. I think we’re well past the All Might and Mr. Midoriya phase. Wouldn’t you agree, Hisashi?”

Hisashi grinned, almost not believing this was really happening. “...That I would, Toshinori.”

  
  
  

***…~AMP~...***

  
  

**(****One Hour Later: Jirou Family Household****)**

  
  

“So, you’ve finally been let in…”

Both families were sitting around the Jirous dining room, with Inko and Mika on the two ends of the table, Toshinori and Kyoutoku on one side, and Hisashi and the resident couple on the other. 

The clinking of utensils against plates emanated across the dining room as they ate, the night going well so far. Hisashi had been taken aback by their home, the pure passion on display. Even the dining room had signed guitars and gold records on the wall. 

He looked up, realizing that Kyoutoku was talking to him. Hisashi nervously chuckled, shrugging his shoulders, “More or less.”

Kyoutoku scoffed, “And you’re taking it…surprisingly well. You don’t seem all that shaken up about the reveal of transferable quirks and secret evil overlords that have it out for our children.”

“Are you kidding? It scares the shit outta me. I’m hoping Shigaraki decides he likes being on his own and doesn’t plan on trying to break All For One out. But, if the truly worst possible situation really does come, then I mean…W-Well, I’ve got faith in them.”

Izuku froze, sukiyaki centimeters from his mouth as he turned to look at his father, “Really?”

Hisashi raised a brow at him, now his turn to scoff. “Kid, you fought the Hero Killer. You fought Gang Orca. You just beat the Number Two Hero, who we also learned is a trained assassin. You two are still just a couple of first years. If the League decide to take their time, then-”

“Ah!” Kyouka quickly cut in, one of her jacks pointing directly between his eyes. “Don’t jinx it! Don’t say stuff like that!”

Hisashi cleared his throat, glancing around at the rest of the table, “...I assume this happens a lot around here?”

The rest of the adults all nonchalantly answered with nods and “Yeah, pretty much”. 

Inko reached over, patting her husband’s back, “You’ll catch on.”

“To be fair,” Izuku sighed. “I highly doubt it matters. The worst case scenario would probably happen anyway.”

“Maybe,” Mika said, raising up her wine glass. “But, enough focusing on the possible future bad times. We’re here to celebrate the good, mainly you two getting your licenses.”

“Agreed,” Inko nodded, raising her own glass. “We couldn’t be prouder of you two. It was to be expected, though.”

“You’re telling me,” Hisashi chuckled. “I didn’t even have to go in and alter their grades.”

They all laughed, raising their glasses to the couple. But, hearing about how proud of them they were caused them to look at each other, the guilt already setting in. Izuku bit the inside of his cheek, sighing as he spoke, “...Unfortunately, there’s a bad time that does need to be talked about.”

“Oh boy…” Kyoutoku sighed, grabbing his beer and taking a long drink.

“A part of me is screaming to just hold off on this. We just got through so much, why pile on even more? But, I’m realizing it’s just better to get all the bad stuff out now so we can have some semblance of peace for longer.” 

“Welp,” Toshinori suddenly stood up, stretching his arms out. “Time to hit the ol’ dusty trail…”

Kyouka peered at him, “What are you doing? You weren’t involved this time.”

“I promised to be your guardian while at school. Literally everything you two do comes back to me somehow.”

“Hey, we weren’t the ones that started it either, so I think you’re safe.”

“What exactly are we talking about?” Mika interrupted, bringing the conversation back. Toshinori slowly started to move away from the table, but Mika snapped her fingers, pointing at his chair. “Sit. You haven’t been granted immunity yet.”

Toshinori groaned as he sat back down, everyone silent as they turned their attention back to Izuku. He sighed, feeling Kyouka take his hand under the table. She nudged him, saying, “I can go first, if you want. I was the one who went, after all.”

“N-No, it’s fine.”

“Well, let’s at least own it together.”

Izuku was about to retort, but he knew they would just end up going in circles. It was more than fair. He nodded, turning back to the waiting parents. “...We got into a fight.”

As the parents started glancing around at each other, Toshinori quickly jumped in, “They were goaded into it.”

“Mm…Sort of,” Kyouka shrugged.

Hisashi crossed his arms, leaning them on the table, “With who?”

Izuku sighed, opening his mouth to finally reveal it, but Inko, Mika, and Kyoutoku all said simultaneously, “Bakugou.”

Izuku furrowed his brow, peering at his mom, “Y-...How did you-?”

His mom was looking down at her plate, disappointment on her face. But, Izuku had a strong feeling her disappointment was more directed at Bakugou than himself. “Izuku…Who else? The day at the playground, all those years ago? There’s no one it could’ve been, not with those burns. I spoke to Mitsuki, but she had the same result when trying to talk to her son. Neither of you would confess anything, but we knew. That boy has had an anger streak for a long time.”

“I remember we talked about him some time ago,” Kyoutoku said, remembering his conversation with Izuku after the mid-terms. “Or, well, sort of. You didn’t want to talk about him.”

“Little Bakugou…” Hisashi scoffed, rubbing his chin as he thought back. “I mean, I-I’m obviously out of the loop on a lot of things. I knew he was always, uh…rambunctious. But, I didn’t know it was that bad…”

“You’ve got no idea,” Kyouka chuckled dryly, deadpan expression as she still hated talking about him. 

“After he got his quirk…” Izuku’s throat suddenly felt like it was blocked up, still conditioned after all these years to stay silent. At least, to authority figures. Although, at this point Kyouka counted as an authority over him, in a certain way. He just had to spit it out. “...He sort of bullied me…a lot.”

As expected, Hisashi was the only one that showed any form of shock. By this point, everyone knew and just didn’t want to pry. They didn’t know the extent of it, but from the clues they had received over the time they had known Izuku, it got far more obvious.

Kyoutoku and Mika had already brought up his relationship with Bakugou in the past, able to see from the Sports Festival how volatile it was. 

He had spoken with All Might about it on his birthday, when learning to drive. He had pretty much known from the moment he met Izuku and analyzed his behavior.

Inko knew about the bullying. Izuku had revealed that to her after they had finally reconnected. He purposely never named anyone specific, but Katsuki had to be the most obvious possible answer in the world. She had come to terms with most of it some time ago, fully intending to keep her promise to Izuku to leave it all behind.

…But, there was still that bubbling rage inside. A description like that used for her was so out of character, but this was her son.

There was no way Mitsuki knew the extent of things either. She knew that women would have never allowed it to happen again. She would follow Bakugou twenty-four/seven, just to make sure he behaved. 

Hisashi turned in his chair to face the couple directly, “Define ‘a lot’.”

“Most of the time, if I just kept my head down he didn’t care. It wasn’t a daily thing, only on rare occasions.”

“In a vacuum, sure. But, even if rare, accumulating over a decade…”

“...It was a lot,” Izuku sighed. 

Hisashi took a deep breath, his fist clenching and unclenching, his calm demeanor remaining. He turned back to his wife, noticing her lack of surprise. “Did you know?”

“Yes and no. He never told me who specifically, but I knew.”

“Did you call the school? I know it’s been a long time, but maybe-”

“I promised Izuku that I’d let him handle it, and I intend to keep that promise.”

Izuku leaned past his father to look at Inko, a brow raised, “Even if my way of handling it ended up in a fight?”

“That depends. What exactly happened?”

“That’s…a loaded question. Before anyone asks, no, he hasn’t bullied me since middle school. Even if he could get away with it at UA, I doubt he’d do anything. A lot of his reasoning in the past was to make sure I didn’t go to UA with him. I’m already in, so anything further would be pointless.”

“Why wouldn’t he want you to go to UA?” HIsashi asked.

“Ego,” Kyouka answered instantly, arms crossed as she rested her head back on her chair, staring up at the ceiling. “He didn’t want a quirkless kid ‘messing up his origin story’, the fucking prick. Ow!

Kyouka flinched as Mika’s jack shot over and lightly thwacked her on the forehead, “Language…But, he is a fucking prick.”

“But, you just-!”

“Anyway, Izuku, continue.”

Izuku chuckled as Kyouka pouted next to him, continuing on, “Bakugou and I have been mostly avoiding each other all year. At least, that’s how it’s been since the Sports Festival. There seemed to be a mutual understanding that it was better if we just didn’t speak to one another.”

“But,” Kyouka chimed in. “There was always the obvious butthurt attitude he had whenever Izuku surpassed him in any way.”

Izuku sighed, but nodded. She wasn’t wrong. “Which led to the License Exams. He didn’t pass. He was already struggling with my progress, but most of all he was struggling with the camp attack. He feels guilty for letting himself get kidnapped, thinking his weakness caused All Might to retire. And, I’ll just say it before Kyouka does, his ego made him think that the whole situation was about him.”

“Thanks, babe.”

“But, not passing the exams was the straw that broke the camel’s back. When we got back to the dorms, he told me to meet him out at Ground Beta after curfew. That was where I beat him for the first time, during Battle Training. We instantly knew he wanted to fight me. But, we knew that he wouldn’t just let this go, so…” Izuku turned to Kyouka, now getting to her part of the story.

“And, that’s where I stepped in,” Kyouka continued on. “I had promised myself that I wouldn’t let Bakugou hurt Izuku ever again, and that includes distracting him with his bullshit during an already stressful time in his life. So, I offered to go in his stead. If Bakugou actually had some super important stuff that we needed to hear, then I’d get Izuku. Otherwise? He could kick rocks…He didn’t like that…Or me. I’ve gotten a bit of a reputation at school as Bakugou’s number one hater.”

“If Bakugou said he was thirsty, Kyouka would waterboard him,” Izuku clarified for them. 

“Or drown him,” Kyouka added. “But, anyway, it obviously didn’t go well. We started shouting at each other, he persisted on seeing Izuku…I may or may not have called him many things. And, then he blasted me aside, so I-”

“He what?” Kyoutoku’s face instantly switched to a glare, face twitching into a snarl. “He hit you?”

“Okay, before the Protective Dad shtick comes out…” Kyouka quickly cut him off, putting her hand out towards him. “He mainly did it to move me out of the way, and I punched him in the face directly after. I can handle myself, we all know this. Trust me, Dad. There’s nothing you could feasibly do to Bakugou that Izuku didn’t do amplified by a million.”

“Like what?”

“I…What?”

“What did he do?”

The couple shared a glance, realizing he was serious. He just heard some guy beat up his daughter, after all. Izuku decided to answer, not one to back down from owning up to his own actions. 

“I-I, um…I showed up later. There was just something in my brain telling me that Kyouka was fighting. It was almost like I could hear the explosions. When I got there and realized what happened, I…I kind of snapped. I suppose I have years of built up aggression against him that I pushed down, but seeing Kyouka like that broke the dam open in a single swing. I broke his nose,” Izuku sighed, beginning to list off what he could remember. “Then, I slammed him into the ground. I threw him into a building, hit him a lot. I punched him up a building, threw him into a parking garage, uh…A lot of other things. I’m pretty sure some of his ribs were broken…”

Kyoutoku took a deep breath, calming himself down, folding his hands together as he nodded. “...I couldn’t have asked for anyone better to be with my daughter.”

“Wh-? Dad!” Kyouka exclaimed, her cheeks turning red.

“Wasn’t a joke,” He shook his head, looking at Izuku. “I mean that, wholeheartedly. I know it’s probably not a side of yourself that you like, but I think we share the same sentiment when it comes to people that hurt Kyouka. Thank you.”

“We all share the sentiment,” Inko said, everyone turning to her. “I…I don’t like violence, anyone who knows me is aware of that. But…But, I also believe you defend your family with everything you’ve got.”

“In reality, she didn’t need me to defend her,” Izuku shrugged. “Kyouka did a serious number on him before I got there, and she was holding herself back a lot. If you want to be proud of anyone, it should be her. I-...Wait, wait, wait. I s-sort of thought we’d be in more trouble.”

“Sounds like the kid deserved it,” Kyoutoku said nonchalantly, going back to his food.

Mika’s jack shot out, jabbing her husband’s side as she looked at the couple, “If I heard you correctly, you two didn’t start this fight?”

“W-...Well, no. But, we didn’t handle it ideally.”

“No, but being dragged out to a fight isn’t an ideal situation to find yourself in. Neither is finding someone physically harming the one you love. Our bias aside, I don’t think anyone can exactly fault you. Kyouka, you should’ve just ignored him. But, at the same time, we all know how much you love Izuku. Your hate for him is entirely understandable, and he did hit you first. We raised you to stand up for yourself, after all. Just, please, try to stay more level-headed if he tries anything again.”

Kyouka clicked her tongue, her arms still crossed, “...I can’t promise anything. I just promise to try. If he speaks to us, I’m still gonna insult him.”

“That’s all I ask. Besides, we can’t exactly ground either of you. You don’t live at home.”

“We have detention all week, anyway. We didn’t get off scot-free. Although, after everything with the Hawks, maybe Aizawa will be more forgiving?”  
  

Toshinori just deadpanned at her, “What do you think?”

“I can have hope, okay!”

“...Is there anything you need me to do?” Everyone turned to Hisashi as he looked at his son. “I…I know I should’ve been here before, done something. But, now…”

Izuku peered at him, “You…You mean like get Bakugou expelled or something?”

“Wh-? Oh! No-No-No, not like that. I don’t want to start my new career by handling my son’s high-school rivalries, that wouldn’t look good. I need to prove I’m responsible with this power. I just meant go and talk to parents. I could start some programs for the quirkless.”

“Oh. Thank you, but no. O-Or, not now. Just focus on getting the HPSC up and running. I don’t want my problems messing anything up. The reason I asked mom to let me handle all this myself is because I didn’t want anything from my past coming back to haunt us. Clearly, Bakugou disagreed, but I’ve finally come to terms with it all. For the most part, at least. I’ve moved on from Aldera. I’ve accepted everything that happened, rather than keep running away from it, like I did for years…Which is why I have one last thing to tell you all.”

Kyouka watched as Izuku pressed his tongue to the back of his teeth, preparing himself and trying to find the right words. Her jack went down and wrapped around his wrist, tugging at him a little, “You don’t have to do this today, if you think it’s too much.”

“No, I’m fine, really. I’m more worried for them than myself.” Izuku sighed, wrapping his fingers around the Kyouka’s jack on his wrist. “I need to clarify before anyone freaks out, I *never* tried. The idea was impossible to me, I didn’t want to, there were a million reasons why I wasn’t going to. But, I-...There were some days where I thought about what it would be like, if…i-if I wasn’t around. I…What am I saying? I can’t beat around the bush anymore. Suicidal thoughts.” 

“...” The silence in the room was so far beyond painful. Izuku would rather fight Muscular again. 

He could see everyone except Kyouka try to process it, nobody making a move. Their expressions were shocked for just a moment, before concern completely washed over them. 

But, Inko looked like she was about to have a breakdown. Her eyes were closed, and Izuku could see her hands trembling.

Izuku put his hands up defensively, “Again! I need to clarify that I never tried, never planned, and was never gonna. Never even considered it. It was just thoughts about the topic on some really bad days. I wasn’t on the brink, or anything like that. Just thoughts, nothing more. We all know I’m far too stubborn to ever actually take that route…I did sometimes stand on the ledge of my school roof, but that isn’t what it sounds like, I promis-Oomph!!!”

Inko had rounded the table in the blink of an eye, engulfing her son in the tightest hug he had ever experienced. Coming from Inko, that was saying a lot.

He felt her weave a hand through his hair, muffled sobs against his shoulder as his back was already wet with tears, and not the typical torrent. Izuku hugged her back, realizing it was probably better to just stop trying to sugarcoat it to make them feel better. Even if it was true that he never actually planned or really considered it, the thoughts alone are extremely serious. 

To him, it was the past.

To everyone else, they just learned that there’s a world out there where he wasn’t a part of their lives.

There was a time in Izuku’s life where he would’ve thought that was a good thing. 

He felt a hand go around his shoulders, squeezing the crook of his neck. Hisashi had reached over, his other hand on Inko’s back. Izuku could tell his father was silent because he didn’t know what to do with himself, and then there was the other problem. It was the same problem that his mom was probably going through.

“Don’t either of you dare feel guilty,” Izuku shook his head, trying to find a tone that was a balance between comforting and firm. He needed to make sure this was instilled in their heads. “So much of it is my own fault. This isn’t me trying to redirect the blame either. The blame falls on me and how quirkless are treated. I can’t be the only one. I’m probably the luckiest one. But, please, I need you to understand it’s not your fault.”

His mom didn’t seem to answer, or at least wasn’t in the right mind to. But, he met his father’s gaze, and Hisashi just nodded slightly. He knew his dad would still feel guilty. He knew, because Izuku would too. 

But, he’d try his best.

Izuku looked around, finding the Jirous conflicted. Mika looked like she wanted to do the same thing as his mom, and Kyoutoku looked like he wanted to punch something. 

All Might…Well, All Might was just staring down at the table, his expression mostly blank. 

“Listen, I’m really sorry to drop this bomb on everyone. But, after the fight, I knew I had to come clean about my past. Not just the bullying, but everything. I was…I was depressed. I was for a very long time, even if I never acknowledged it, mainly to myself. Mom, I doubt that’s very surprising to you, based on how I was for all those years. Kyouka has obviously heard all this a long time ago, but…I just want to say that everyone in this room, and all of my friends at UA, has made those feelings nothing but a faded scar.” Izuku turned his gaze over to his father, giving him a reaffirming nod. “Everyone…”

He saw his father’s eyes glisten a bit, but he just nodded in return. Izuku gently coaxed his mom up, looking her in the eyes before continuing. 

“This is the happiest I have ever been in my entire life. I fought through it all, and made it here. With help, of course. But, I didn’t go anywhere, and I’m not going anywhere. I am here, remember?” 

Inko laughed out a half-chuckle and half-sob, covering her eyes with her hand as she shook her head. She took both of Izuku’s hands in her own, squeezing them as she kissed his knuckles. “...I-I’m…I’m so s-”

“Don’t apologize.”

“But, all those years, I…I should’ve known. I…Maybe I did, and I just didn’t want to accept it. I just-”

“You have nothing to apologize for. That goes for you too,” Izuku looked up at his father, and then turned his gaze to All Might. “You either. I’m not gonna let my stubbornness and inability to ask for help cause anybody more pain than I’ve already put them through. We’re all here together now, and I would never, *ever* dream of having thoughts like that again. That’s what’s important.”

Inko wiped at her eyes, using her free hand to caress her son’s cheek. “...I love you.”

“I know. Believe me, I do. I love you too…” Izuku looked up, gazing around at everyone else. “All of you...Although, I think it’s pretty apparent that mom and Kyouka are kind of in a tier of their own. That’s obviously not a slight at any of you, but we all know how much work they’ve put in with me. My mom has sixteen-years worth, and Kyouka has probably fit in just as much work only within a year’s time. They deserve special commendation for everything I’ve put them through.”

Everyone chuckled, bringing at least some levity to the room. 

Izuku rubbed his mother’s back, still not letting go, “A-Anyway, that’s all, I think. I just wanted this out there. I’ve kept it in for too long, and it’s better for me and all of you that it’s known. If anyone’s got any other bombs to drop tonight, I’ll happily take the attention off of me.”

“...Are you sure I can’t at least beat up some parents?” Kyoutoku asked, a little smirk on his lips. Kyouka’s first instinct was to make a remark about the glisten in her father’s eyes, but it warmed her heart more than anything. 

“Or kill some parents,” Mika mumbled, cleaning tears stains off of her glasses. She put her glasses back on, clearing her throat as she stood up. “I’ve held off long enough. I’m taking my turn now.”

Izuku raised a brow, “Turn?”

His question was quickly answered as Mika latched onto Izuku, pressing a kiss to the top of his head. Kyouka looked over to her father, nodding towards Izuku, “I can hear your foot tapping, old man. C’mon, now’s not the time to be macho.”

Kyouka barely got her sentence out before Kyoutoku practically launched across the table and joined in on the hug. She hung back this time, knowing they all needed their time with this. She had already gone through it all and more with Izuku.

But, she glanced over at All Might, noticing he was still very quiet. 

Her jack reached out under the table, poking his knee. Toshinori jumped in surprise, being ripped from his thoughts and looking over at Kyouka. She mouthed the words, *“You okay?”*

Toshinori just pursed his lips and nodded, his attention turning back to the family before him.

Kyouka’s memories were brought back to Izuku’s birthday, when all of their friends showed their love and support in this very room. Just like back then, she could see how happy Izuku really was. There was no hiding that. 

They were gonna be just fine.

**(****Some Time Later: Night: UA Teacher’s Housing Parking Lot****)**

  
  

“Honey, you have to let go at some point.”

“No, I don’t.” Inko said firmly, holding onto Izuku tightly as their son struggled to exit the car. 

The moon was shining high up above, the skies clear that night. They had said their goodbyes to the Jirous, with Izuku having a similar struggle to escape their grasp too.

Mostly Kyoutoku…

“I know you hold authority over me,” Kyouka chuckled, closing the car door. “But, I would very much like him back at some point.”

Inko sighed, taking Izuku’s face and kissing his forehead. “You’re sure you’re okay?”

“I’m sure,” Izuku nodded, a smile gracing his lips. “I’m so far beyond okay.”

She sighed again, hugging him again once more, but then finally releasing him. “Okay…But, if you ever-”

“I know,” Izuku chuckled. “I know…What about you?”

Hisashi perked up, realizing Izuku’s gaze turned to him, “Hm?”

“You must be mentally exhausted. This is probably the craziest forty-eight hours of your life. We’ve thrown everything at you. Are you okay?”

“Yeah. Yeah, I…I guess I still don’t feel worthy of even knowing some of this stuff, but I…I-I know I’ve said it enough already, but I’m here now. I know Jirou and your mother are the first people you’re gonna go to, and I completely understand that. But, if you ever need me, if you ever feel anything like what you just told us about, I always will be from now on, I’m never going anywhere. I’m here for you, and…I love you.”

Izuku’s eyes widened, not really sure why he was surprised. It was just that…It had been years since either of them had said it to each other.

“...I love you too.”

Inko covered her mouth, trying and failing to hold back another sob. If there was anybody that had been agonizingly waiting for that moment, it was her. Both Midoriya men chuckled, moving to hug her. Inko practically broke both of their ribs as she cried again. 

As he struggled to breath, Izuku looked over at the nearby parking space, finding All Might leaning against his truck, looking out at Musutafu silently. He had been silent for hours now. Once Inko eventually let go, he started to walk towards him.

“Gimme a minute. I’ll be right back.” Izuku walked over to All Might, leaving his parents and Kyouka to themselves.

Kyouka watched him go, hearing Hisashi speak up next to her. 

“You know…For months, all Inko could ever do was say how much you’ve done for our family. I don’t think I could’ve possibly comprehended just how much until now.” Kyouka looked over at him, brows raised as he bit the inside of his cheek, staring vacantly as he continued. “In such a short amount of time, you’ve helped my son shoulder all this weight. You’ve pushed him further, you’ve guided him through all this trauma that I never could’ve guessed that he underwent, you chose to stand by him to fight against an almost insurmountable evil before you got the crazy powers, and without you, I don’t think our family would be brought together again like this. Even with the work I still have to do to make up for my mistakes, I wouldn’t have gotten this chance without you. I…I-I just…How’d you do it?”

Kyouka pursed her lips, a tint of red on her cheeks from such praise. But, she merely shrugged, the answer being so simple to her. “...I love him.”

“...” Hisashi was stunned into silence for what seemed like the hundredth time that night. A smile gracing his lips, he nodded, “...You two are gonna be Number One.”

Kyouka saw his smile, the corner of her own lips twitching up, “Eh…Maybe.”

Once he got to the truck, Izuku leaned against it, right next to Toshinori. “...Sorry for not saying anything. You probably would want to know that about someone you’re entrusting the future with.”

“...”

“...But, I hope you know that you’re one of the biggest contributors to what kept me going all those years. If you’re thinking about when you told me I couldn’t be a hero, there’s a whole lot more to it than that. I told you before that you shouldn’t apologize for that, I think-”

Izuku was cut off as Toshinori grabbed his shirt, yanking Izuku in and hugging him tightly. He heard Toshinori give a trembling sigh, and say, “I love ya, kid. Should’ve said that a long time ago.”

It was Izuku’s turn to be stunned into silence tonight. His mouth was open, but no words came out. It was one of those things where he probably knew it, but to hear it out loud…

He didn’t need to say anything else to convey his feelings about the entire situation. That was all Izuku needed to know.

So, Izuku just hugged him back, and said, “...I love you too.”

From her spot near Hisashi’s car, Kyouka bit the inside of her cheek as her eyes began to sting as she listened in on them.

*“God-damn it…”* Kyouka grumbled, realizing it was her turn to cry tonight, fruitlessly using the back of her index finger to wipe away tears.

“Hey…” She glanced up, seeing All Might extend one of his arms out. “C’mere.”

“I..N-Nah, it’s okay. This is your moment.”

“Would it convince you if I said that I love you too?”

In a flash of violet light, Kyouka zipped over and hugged them both. “...Maybe.”

  
  
  
  

***…~AMP~...***

  
  
  

**(****Next Morning: UA Holding Area****)**

  
  

*“Am I under arrest or what? Cause, if not, this is basically kidnapping.”*

Toshinori sighed as he leaned against the two-way mirror as they all watched Hawks sit in the interrogation room, clearly very bored. He and Torino sat on the other side, intercom panel and wall of screens to their right as they recorded everything.

Tsukauchi had already been at it for a while, and didn’t get very far. All Hawks said was “Lawyer” over and over again.

Now, they were bringing in their trap card.

Toshinori moved away from the mirror, crossing his arms as he began to pace. “Not sure why he’s being so stubborn, We already have everything he said from the other night recorded.”

“The less he admits to, the better case he’ll have,” Torino shrugged. “It won’t be much, but still.”

The door suddenly opened up, Kaina and Tsukauchi on the other side. Toshinori smiled at her, but his gaze quickly caught the large, blocky, black and gray cuffs holding Kaina’s arms together.

“Oh, come on. Is that really necessary?”

“It’s fine, Toshi,” Kaina tried to wave it off dismissively. “I’ll take handcuffs here instead of a cell at Tartarus.”

“No, no, Tsukauchi, please. I promise you that she’s not going anywhere. She’s here willingly. Everyone here can attest to that.”

“Tsukauchi…” Torino cut in, nodding at Kaina. “It’s fine. Take ‘em off.”

Tsukauchi put his hands up in defense, moving over to Kaina. “Alright, it was just a precaution. I can at least say she was cuffed in the paperwork.”

He took out his key and unlocked the cuffs, the thick locks releasing as he slid them off her wrists. She rubbed her wrists, nodding at him, “Thanks. Okay, has he said anything?”

“What do you think?” Torino groaned. 

“We’re never that lucky, huh?” Kaina chuckled, moving over to look at the cameras, watching as Hawks lay on his back in bed, arms crossed and staring at the ceiling. “Any word from Madam President?”

“At home, calm as can be,” Tsukauchi replied, moving to stand next to Kaina. “Odds are she’s been prepared for this possibility for many years. Most of the board, if not all of them, will just be able to cut deals to stay out of jail. Those that do, well…Jail is a very strong word. The places they’ll be sent to are prisons in name only. They’re practically resorts you’re not allowed to leave. And, all of them are at bare minimum affiliated with completely clean and legitimate businesses and organizations outside of the HPSC.”

Kaina ran her hands down her face, a low growl in her voice, “So, basically we’re sending them on paid vacations.”

Tsukauchi rubbed the back of his neck with a sigh, “Well, prison is still prison. They won’t want to be there, but…Yeah.”

Kaina pressed her tongue hard against her lip, clutching her forearms tightly, “I need to punch something.”

***\*POOF\****

Toshinori buffed up into his hero form, and Kaina quickly jabbed his abdomen. It did nothing, but still. “Thanks.”

Toshinori reverted back to normal, coughing a bit, “No problem.”

The door opened again, with Hisashi walking through in black slacks and a beige button-up with his sleeves rolled up, “Sorry I’m late. Had to help with packing. So, has he-”

He stopped, double-taking as he locked eyes with Kaina. She smiled, nodding at him, “Hey, man.”

“...H-Hey.” He cleared his throat as he walked up to her, hand outstretched. “It’s good to see you awake. I’m Hisashi Midoriya. I’m-”

“The father of one of the kids that saved my ass. I can see the resemblance.” She chucked as she shook his hand, “Toshinori told me all that you’ve done for me. You’ve got no idea how much I appreciate it.”

“After last night, I can take a guess. Thanks for saving me.”

“Thanks for being my bait. You’re easily the best government worker I’ve ever worked with.”

“A-Ah, well, we’ve just proven that’s not a high bar.”

“Haha, true. But, I’m sorry if you’re out of a job because of all this.”

Hisashi’s brows rose, looking around at everyone else, realizing that Kaina didn’t know. “W-Well, actually…You kind of gave me a promotion.”

Kaina furrowed her brow, looking over at Toshinori for an answer. All Might chuckled, nodding at Hisashi, “Meet the new HPSC President.”

“A-Acting President…technically.”

Kaina shifted her eyes between everyone in the room, her gaze cautious, “Already?”

“No, not yet. Nothing’s official, but…I mean, we need someone to run things now.”

“We haven’t even made any arrests.”

“Kaina, I know what you’re thinking.” Toshinori walked up to her, hand gently on her shoulder. “I promise you can trust him. Hisashi is the best person to take over. Your fight to purge corruption was a success, I swear.”

Kaina bit the inside of her cheek, staring at Hisashi, but she eventually sighed. “...If Toshinori trusts you, then so do I. You’ve already risked your life for me. Giving you a chance is the least I owe you.”

Hisashi sighed in relief, nodding his head, “Thank you, Ms. Tsutsumi. I’ll do my best, I promise.”

She ran her hands down her face, groaning in exhaustion, “Ugh, so what happens now?”

Torino hopped up out of his chair, using his cane to poke Kaina’s boot, “You. We’re hoping you can make him talk.”

“Didn’t I already do that?”

“Yes, but we’re hoping for a little more.”

Kaina furrowed her brow, turning to look at Hawks through the mirror, “...You want me to flip him.”

“More or less,” Toshinori shrugged. “It would make a trial a whole lot easier, and he deserves a chance. They took him in as a child. He never even stood a chance to be his own person.”

“That’s just it though. I was lied to, and then blackmailed with my own life. He’s been indoctrinated. He won’t flip in a day.”

Tsukauchi nodded, “That’s true, but we have time. We won’t have a trial for quite some time. In your recordings, you said yourself that you don’t think he’s completely lost.”

Kaina sighed through her nose, glancing over at Hisashi, “You okay with this? You were almost a victim.”

“By choice,” Hisashi replied. “I’m no stranger to getting second chances. If we can get him on our side, that’s not just another victory against the board members, but we’ll save a good hero. Assassin or not, Hawks has saved thousands of lives doing legitimate hero work. I think he deserves a chance to be free from them. The hero world is better with him in it.”

“...Alright. Let me in.” Kaina walked over to the metal door next to the mirror, taking a deep breath as Tsukauchi buzzed her in. The door unlocked and slid open, allowing her inside. 

Hawks looked up, his brows raising as he saw her. Kaina walked in, the door shutting behind her as she sat down across from him in the steel gray room. He was handcuffed to the table, but he still brought his hands up in a little wave, “Sup.”

“Morning,” Kaina nodded, crossing her legs as she leaned back into the chair. They sat there in silence, almost as if they were waiting for the other to make a move first. Kaina peered at him, reminded of just how young he was. “Hold old were you when they took you?”

“Lawye-”

“Don’t you do that. Not with me. I remember seeing you in the HPSC building a long time ago. You couldn’t have been more than what? Ten?” Hawks continued to sit in silence, not arms crossed. “...Do you have a life?”

Keigo raised a brow, scoffing, “So, you just switch to insults?”

“Not what I meant. How much do they own you? They hired me in my twenties, but once I found out what was really going on, they tried to root their way into so many aspects of my life. But, you? Just a child? Do you own your home? Do you get to keep your own money? Do they feed you? Do you even own the clothes on your back?”

“You make me sound like a damn puppet.”

“That’s exactly what you are. But, that’s not your fault. You never even had the chance to be your own person. They made you their puppet, made to do their dirty work. Every life you took…It was on them, yet you’re the one that’s going to have to live with it for the rest of your life.”

“You don’t know me,” Hawks scoffed.

“Then teach me,” Kaina countered. But, Hawks continued to sit in silence, refusing to elaborate any further. She sighed, crossing her arms across her stomach as she leaned back. “Whatever they’ve done for you, it’s not because they cared. It’s because they needed a tool that would listen. They wanted to reward the brainwashing. Once the news comes out, you’re gonna see. There will be some chaos, some panic, just a bit. But, when they see that their corrupt government was outed and renewed by people who actually care? The people that purged their corruption in the first place? With the help of All Might, of all people? They’ll have more faith in us than ever.”

“How long’s that gonna take?” Hawks chuckled. “How high is the crime rate gonna rise? How many anti-government groups are gonna double in numbers? How many-?”

“You know what’s funny?” Kaina cut him off. “Perhaps we’ve been so over-reliant on heroes for too long, but I believe the one thing heroes should never do is lack faith in the people they protect. The thing about humans, even you and me, is we always keep going. We’re not given a choice. Despite everything that happened to me, here I stand. Even if they don’t know it yet, they’re gonna find the strength to push forward. You can too, you know.”

“Oh brother…”

“I saw it during the fight. You didn’t want to hurt me, or especially the other two. You had an opportunity to hurt that boy, and you stopped. You couldn’t do it, could you? You knew it was wrong, and you couldn’t bring yourself to do it. Something inside of you has known it’s wrong for a long time. You just can’t accept it, because if you do, then everything you’ve worked for is a lie. Everything you’ve done was for the wrong reasons. You keep the snarky, cool attitude up to hide from yourself. I did it too. But, tell me…Do you see blood on your hands?”

“...” Hawks was still silent, but his gaze slowly moved away from hers.

“Sometimes you’re able to forget, just for a while. But, then you look down, and all you see is red. Me, at least I could do my job from far away. Didn’t have to look them in the eyes. But, you? Did they make you kill ‘terrorists’ too? Maybe the new president did change things. Maybe you only killed villains. But, how many deserved to die? How many didn’t have a murder or robbery to their name, and were only meddling in HPSC affairs? How many were innocent, and just got too close for comfort? How many of these questions can you even answer, when you were probably lied to for all of them?”

“...”

Kaina sighed, standing up, putting her hands down on the table. “I’ve seen your record. I’ve seen you in the popularity polls. You’re a good hero, kid. I remember when you got All Might’s autograph. You really wanted to be a hero, the passion was truly there. Maybe it still is. But, answer me this. What’s a puppet without its strings?”

Hawks stared at her for a minute, before finally answering, “...Useless.”

Kaina shook her head, leaning forward and staring him dead in the eyes. “...Free.”

She turned around, leaving the interrogation room, Hawks’ eyes following her as she left. Once the door was shut, she walked over to the others, sitting back down. 

Tsukauchi nodded at Hawks through the two-way mirror, “You think that’ll work?”

“It won’t. Not yet. I just gave him something to stew on. He won’t be able to stop thinking about it, if he wasn’t already. He’ll need to see it to believe it. He needs to see the people are strong enough to carry on, even after learning about what the higher-ups have done.”

“It’ll be hard for some. They lost the HPSC, which usually wouldn’t have much trust as a government branch, but it’s directly tied to heroes. And, they lost All Might, the strongest pillar they had to rely on. I mean, there’s Endeavor, but…”

Kaina scoffed, “That prick has the charisma of a rock, and that’s insulting to rocks.” 

“....Maybe that’s a good thing,” Toshinori said, turning everyone’s heads to him. “Maybe they need to believe in themselves instead of just me.”

“Baby steps, Toshi. They won’t turn so quickly. They’ll need people to guide them to that conclusion.”

Toshinori hummed, nodding his head, “Yeah, but the two I’d bet my money on are still a fews years away from graduation. That’s just for the hero side. For the government side…”

They all turned towards Hisashi, his eyes widening as he realized everyone was staring at him. “...What?”

Kaina smirked at him, “You ready for a press conference, Mr. President?”

  
  
  

***…~AMP~...***

  
  

**(****UA High: Class 1-A****)**

  
  

“Who do you guys think it is?”

Kyouka turned in her seat, looking at Ochako as their friends stood around Izuku’s desk, “What are you talking about?”

“They made an announcement this morning,” Tenya answered. “Apparently, a villain was apprehended and is being held in the UA cells.”

Izuku and Kyouka shared a glance as Momo said, “I didn’t even know that UA was allowed to do that.”

“Well, in official UA Safety Procedures, in case of emergenci-”

Thankfully, Tenya was cut off as the door to the class opened, Aizawa walking through, coffee in hand. 

“Okay, sit down and shut up.” Everyone was instantly in their seats, silence permeating throughout the class. Aizawa set his coffee down, turning back to his students. His eyes locked onto the right side of his class, staring at the Katsuki. “Do I need to move you?

Katsuki furrowed his brow in confusion, but then he realized what he was getting at. He was directly in front of Izuku and Kyouka. “...No. There won’t be any problems.”  
  

Aizawa continued to stare, moving his gaze up to the couple, “And, you two?”

They looked at each other, but both eventually shook their heads, simultaneously saying, “No, sir.”

“Mm…Okay, then,” Aizawa nodded. “Four students swapping seats would be annoying anyway, and moving Midoriya away from Jirou would be like trying to take a fish out of a shark’s mouth.” The class laughed while Kyouka deadpanned, her cheeks turning red. Aizawa started to lazily pace at the front of the room, starting class. “Some of you may probably know, but work studies are coming up. We’re going to talk a little more about what those will entail tomorrow, but there’s something I’ve been meaning to speak to you all about. I thought about it after the USJ, but I felt maybe you weren’t ready for it. But, after camp, it’s high time that we had this conversation. This isn’t a typical lesson, this is a very serious topic. So, please, no jokes. No unnecessary interruptions. Questions are encouraged, but you’re allowed to wait until after class to ask them if you’re not comfortable. Are we clear?”

Everyone looked around, all with curious and slightly worried glances. But, the class all nodded, and said together, “Yes, sir.”

“...Okay, then.” Aizawa moved around his desk, leaning against the front of it, crossing his arms. “There’s not really a clean way to say this, but I’ll try my best. Today we’ll be discussing when you’re faced with the choice, or lack thereof, of taking a life.”

If the class wasn’t silent before, it certainly was now. 

“Um, sir…” Kirishima slowly raised his hand. “You want to talk about…killing people?”

“Yes, I do. Whether you like it or not, it’s a dilemma that’s a critical part of this profession. Most teachers save this topic for at least second years. But, you’re already going off to work studies, and you’ve unfortunately been exposed to things first years shouldn’t be. We need to talk about it. If anyone here has anything along the lines of religious reasons as to why they wouldn’t want to even touch the topic, I’ll allow you to leave, but I implore you to stay. If you’re simply uncomfortable with the topic, I’m sorry, but you must stay seated. This isn’t something you can just plug your ears to. Are we ready?”

Everyone glanced around, waiting to see if anybody else made a move. But, they all stayed in their seats, eventually all answering with, “Yes, sir.”

“...Good. To start, you all might be wondering if a hero is even allowed to kill at all. Heroes fall under the same self-defense rules as everybody else. If you feel or know that your life or somebody else’s is being threatened, it is within your rights to act accordingly. But, of course, there’s the minefield that is the job of a hero. As heroes, our job is to protect and defend, which means we already legally have the intent to act. We willingly place ourselves in danger, so the self-defense argument doesn’t always work. In fact, most of the time, it doesn’t work. The whole point is to reduce *all* casualties. Even criminals. Your first instinct should *always* be to subdue or restrain. This isn’t a moral debate, it is a rule you will follow.”

Sero raised his hand, and Aizawa nodded at him, signaling him to speak, “Mr. Aizawa, no offense, but it sounds like you think some of us actually *want* to kill them.”

“I know, and I’m fully aware that’s not what any of you think. But, there will always be people in the world that believe getting rid of villains permanently is the optimal solution. They might decide that their position as a hero is the perfect way to exact that ideal, and they won’t see the difference between that and saving lives. Some might even enjoy the power trip.”

Many eyes in the class tentatively turned to Katsuki, who furrowed his brow once he noticed. “...The fuck are you lookin’ at?”

“Bro,” Kirishima spoke up, gently wringing his wrist, “You shout ‘Die’ every time you attack someone. And, murder is literally in your hero name…”

“That doesn’t mean I wanna kill people!”

“...What else would that mean?”

“I…I don’t know. I just don’t…” Katsuki looked away from them, looking down at his desk, a stern glare on his face, his voice firm. “I don’t want to kill anybody.”

“Alright,” Aizawa cut in, gaining their attention back. “This is a good reminder though, Bakugou. Yelling that kind of stuff won’t go over too well in the popularity polls. But, I suppose Endeavor didn’t get his position from his personality. Forgive the joke, Todoroki.”

“Why?” Shoto shrugged, usual blank expression. “It was funny. And true.”

The class chuckled before Aizawa continued, “I know that taking a life isn’t a concept that anyone can really comprehend, not until they’ve actually done it. In the moment, you might not even think about it. You’re just trying to save an innocent life. For instance…Midoriya…”

Izuku’s brows rose as his teacher looked at him, everyone looking his way. Katsuki didn’t look back, but he turned his head slightly, his ear closer so he could listen. “What?”

“Forgive me for focusing on you, but you’re probably the best example I can use here. If you’d rather not, just say so. But, I’d like to talk about your fight at camp. The one with Muscular…”

That piqued many of his classmates’ interests. Nobody had really asked him about it. All they knew was Izuku broke both of his arms, and Muscular was left in a crater spanning over a kilometer long.

It was an eye-opener for most of them, realizing how powerful Izuku was. Perhaps they were just so used to how he used to be at the beginning of the school year; so quiet and reserved. 

But, he was comatised for two days after the attack. Kyouka was the only witness, and she went with him to the hospital. Then, after Bakugou’s kidnapping and Kamino, the focus shifted away. Nobody really knew what happened. 

“O-Oh…I mean, yeah. That’s fine, but…I thought Muscular survived.”

“He did,” Aizawa quickly corrected him, not wanting a misunderstanding to send his student spiraling. “But, you’re a student, and this was during an event that everyone in here was forced to go through. I feel like that makes it far easier for your classmates to relate to.”

“I understand,” Izuku nodded. 

“Mm. And, Jirou? From my understanding, you had a hand in the fight too. If the memory is too much-”

“I’m all good,” Kyouka shook her head. “In the end, we all made it. Go ahead.”

Aizawa nodded, going back to lazily pacing across the front of the class, “Midoriya fought a villain named Muscular. While you all know that already, what you might not know is that he was trying to kill Kota; the little boy with Mandalay. And, of course, Midoriya and Jirou themselves. It was impossible to miss what happened to Muscular, not with that crater. Midoriya, what was your thought process when you took him down?

“I-...I-I wasn’t directly thinking about killing. I wasn’t thinking much at all, honestly. All I knew was that I had to do everything I could to stop him. I wanted to do absolutely everything in my power to make sure Kyouka and Kota were safe.”

Kyouka could hear Mina whisper under her breath, *“So romantic…”*

Aizawa stopped his pacing and addressed Izuku directly, “You’ve expressed this to me before, but…You thought you were going to die, didn’t you?”

“...Yes, I did.”

Aizawa nodded again, turning to face the whole class, “When you’re out there, seconds away from death yourself, instinct kicks in. Survival for yourself, and the need to protect those you love. This is merely my personal opinion, but do what you must. It’s sad, but sometimes there’s just no helping it. Sometimes, you’re just not given a choice. Not a good one, that is. I know you’ll all do everything you can. Any questions, so far?”

“...What about the villain from Kamino?” All eyes turned to Kyouka as she asked her question. “What about monsters like him? Or Muscular? When we fought him, he…All he cared about was murder. He admitted that he does it because he enjoys it. If given the chance to stop him, for good, I mean…”

“...The villain from Kamino is a special case,” Aizawa sighed, sitting down on his desk. “From speaking with him, I know All Might wasn’t holding back. That villain survived purely because he was lucky to be durable, and All Might had grown weaker. Muscular…Are we talking about a crime of passion? Something you do, because of your hate for him?”

Kyouka pursed her lips, looking down at her desk as memories of camp flashed in her mind. “...I guess so. I’m not saying I’d go out hunting for him, or people like that. I’d never do that, but…I-I mean, if we were to ever see him again…”

“...Legally, no. Morally, it’s obviously understandable. But, killing someone out of hate isn’t something a hero does.”

“I wasn’t-”

“I know,” Aizawa put his hand up, stopping her. “I know you don’t think you’d do that. Nobody likes to think that. But, every single person in this room, in this school, on this planet, can be driven to things completely out-of-character. The world expects us to be stronger than that, but we’re all human. All I can say is to do your best. People like Muscular might deserve it. Hell, he does deserve it. But, we’re not judges. We’re not the jury. And, we’re certainly not the executioners. Not if we can help it.”

Kyouka sighed, nodding her head. She glanced over at Izuku, seeing a small, understanding smile on his face. He turned his hand over, his palm up. Kyouka’s jack snaked down her body and across the floor, going up and wrapping around his hand. 

Aizawa clasped his hands together, turning back to his class, “Okay. Let’s continue…”

  
  
  

***…~AMP~...***

  
  

**(****Unknown Coordinates: Abandoned Satellite Base****)**

  
  

“Tomorrow?”

*“Yep,”* Giran chuckled over the phone. *“Your boy Twice really came through.”*

“Let’s hope so,” Tomura sighed, spinning around in his rolling chair. “I have a strong feeling they’re gonna keep this little experiment of theirs under lock and key.”

*“That quirk drug thing? I mean, it’s the only thing of actual substance the Yakuza have had in over two centuries, so I’d say so. But, you’re the business-type, right? I’m sure everything will be just fine…Probably. Just keep a muzzle on some of your fellow ne’er-do-wells.”*

“Easier said than done. One last thing. Any word from my doctor friend?”

*“Sorry, but nope. I don’t know what you did to piss that guy off, but he’s making himself very difficult to find.”*

Tomura sighed, “He’s always hated me. But, he can’t hide forever. Just keep looking.”

*“You got it, Boss Man.”*

Tomura ended the call, taking off his gloves and disintegrating his burner phone over his trash can, letting the dust slip between his fingers as somebody knocked on his door. “Yeah?”

His door opened, Spinner sticking his head through, “Hey, bro? I think you’re gonna want to see this.”

“...Oh boy.” Tomura got up, dusting off his hands as he followed Spinner out of his room. They made it out of the hallway and onto the balcony looking out over the main room. Everyone else was sitting around the TV, all watching the news. Tomura scoffed as he walked down the stairs, “It must be interesting, because I can’t remember the last time I came down here and you weren’t watching shitty reality shows.”

Magne and Himiko snapped their heads towards him, glares on their faces as the former said, “Don’t you judge our shows. All you watch are gameplay videos.”

“And, shows with actual substance. What’s going on?”  
  

Compress nodded his head at the TV, rewinding back a couple minutes, “They’ve recovered faster than expected.”

Tomura raised a brow, looking at the headline going across the screen.

*“Corruption Exposed at the HPSC. President and Board Involved in Assassinations, Blackmail, and More…”*

Tomura kept reading as it started to mention arrests, showing footage of board members being escorted out of their homes by police. “Mm, good so far.”

“Just wait…” Dabi mumbled.

The camera cut to a press conference, dozens of cameras flashing as a man with curly black hair, green eyes, and freckles forming squares on his face took the podium. He kind of looked like…

*“Good afternoon, everyone. My name is Hisashi Midoriya.”*

…Oh.

*“I’m the Ambassador and Head of Foreign Operations for the HPSC. I hate to be the one to have brought Japan this news today. Nobody would ever want to hear this, especially someone like me who’s worked for the HPSC for twenty years. This case was brought to me by who I can now say is a very good friend, All Might.”* Murmurs broke out as he turned and nodded at Toshinori as he stood nearby with Tsukauchi, Aizawa, and Pixie Bob. *“He and I worked together to expose the crimes of the President and her board members. Not just their crimes, but the crimes of the previous president, starting with the entrapment and blackmailing of the former Pro Hero, Lady Nagant. Without her help, this investigation never would’ve gotten off the ground. We don’t know how far back in the HPSC’s history this goes. We’ll know more as the investigation continues. At this time, we’re not at liberty to say anything more. We will need plenty of time to investigate everything involved with the HPSC board, which will include every connecting branch. This unfortunately means…a temporary, complete shut down.”*

As the press exploded with more questions, Tomura just smiled, “I’m waiting for the bad part.”  
  

“Here it comes,” Compress sighed.

*“However,”* Hisashi raised his voice into the mic, making sure his voice carried over the crowd. *“I will not allow things to go stagnant. Heroes have lives. They have families to take care of, children to feed and shelter, and employees who have the exact same thing. Work and life balance is already a struggle for everyday people, and it’s no different for heroes. Not to mention all of the regular, innocent employees at the HPSC who have nothing to do with the actions of the board. Villains can’t see this as an opportunity to strike, but they indeed will. We need to make sure our heroes are capable of supporting themselves, and their support systems. And, above all else, we need to make a new HPSC that the world can trust. We’ve spoken to other high ranking HPSC members, as well as the proper authorities in the executive cabinet and the Prime Minister. As the highest ranking HPSC member that is not a part of the ongoing investigations…I am to be sworn in as the acting HPSC President.”*

As the press erupted again, the League members all looked around at each other, but they all furrowed their brows as they saw their leader. Tomura just stood there, still smiling. He put his four-finger glove back on, taking the remote from Compress and turning the TV off.

Tomura shrugged, walking over to their kitchen, “I don’t see the problem here. I mean, good for him, right?”

“You don’t?” Compress asked. “They already have a new president, and it’s the father of the kid you seem to have it out for. If anything, won’t that make them come down harder on us?”

“With how full his hands are gonna be?” Tomura scoffed as he opened their fridge, pulling out a soda. “Not to mention, it’s not like he can have some sort of personal vendetta against us. That’ll look suspicious, and the last thing he needs is to look suspicious.”

“Maybe we’d have a better understanding of that if we knew why you’re so focused on a high school couple.”

“Eventual throuple,” Himiko added in.

“All in due time,” Tomura brushed them off as he started walking back towards the stairs. “Instead, focus on waking up bright and early tomorrow. I want everyone ready. We have a meeting…”

  
  
  

***…~AMP~...***

  
  

**(****Evening: Nezu’s Office****)**

  
  

“For you, Mr. President.” 

Hisashi looked up from the couch as Toshinori handed him a sake glass. They were celebrating with Toshinori, Kaina, and Nezu. Aizawa and the Problem Children were busy with detention. Aizawa apparently didn’t think purging government corruption warranted any days off from punishment. “Not quite yet, but thank you.”

“Don’t look so nervous,” Kaina smiled, downing her glass in one go. “You’ll do just fine. Otherwise, I might have to shoot ya.”

Toshinori laughed, putting his hand on Kaina’s shoulder and quickly whispering, *“Please don’t joke about that, or his wife will telepathically pull your eyes out of your skull.”*

Kaina’s eyes widened, realizing he wasn’t kidding, just pouring another glass in silence. *“Ahem.* So, not to ruin the mood even more, but uh…Am I going back to jail?”

“We’ve brokered a deal,” Nezu cheered as he hopped up on his desk, "For the time being, we shall keep you and Hawks here under lockdown until a trial can commence."

Toshinori then clarified, "Basically an extremely cushy, well-fed, and comfortable life in one of our unused housing units."

Nezu smiled brightly, "Precisely!"

“Wait, wait. Me, I understand. Why Bird-Boy?”

“Sending him to jail won’t exactly get him on our side now, will it? Besides, Pro Heroes don’t exactly do well in jail. Too many enemies. UA is filled with Pro Heroes, and as proven by the resident couple, students that are more than capable of detaining him if the worst comes to pass.” 

“Sure, but his wings are gonna grow back, right?”

“We have a bright, young student working on a way to contain him at this very moment. With her track record, she’ll have something for us by tomorrow. Now, Ms. Tsutsumi, you aren’t allowed to leave UA’s campus without supervision. You’re now allowed in the school itself without supervision, and you’re required to check-in every morning and evening. Curfew to be on campus is eight o’clock. You must be back in your home by nine. I’m afraid that if you break any of these rules, without good reason, then you will be sent somewhere else. Not Tartarus, but somewhere else. However, as far as I am concerned, UA is your home. For now, at least.”

Kaina was silent for a bit, slowly pacing across the office, “...Home.”

Toshinori walked up to her, gently touching her arm and guiding her to look at him. “...Do you want to go see it? Tsukauchi had your clothes from your hideout brought here. There’s already furniture, toiletries, electricity, it all comes with the place.”  
  

“I-I…Yes. I’d love to.” Kaina set her glass down, blinking away the stinging in her eyes. She bowed deeply to Nezu, “Thank you, truly. The kindness and hospitality that has been shown to me in the last few days is more than I ever dreamed of receiving again.”

“Of course!” Nezu smiled. “Any friend of Toshinori’s is a friend of mine.”

She then turned to Hisashi, bowing to him as well, “And, thank you. I wouldn’t be here without your help. I’m forever in your debt.”

“A-Ah, well you’re technically the reason I got to further reconnect with my son, become friends with my idol, and get a promotion beyond my wildest dreams,” Hisashi chuckled. “Consider us even.”

“Agree to disagree, but I’m happy to help,” Kaina laughed, turning to Toshinori. “I’ll have to thank your girlfriend, too. Pixie Bob, right?”

Toshinori pursed his lips while Hisashi tried to hide his smirk, “Well…A-Actually, uh…We broke up.”

“...Oh.” Kaina blinked a couple times, just for a split-second the corners of her lips flickered up. “I’m so sorry to hear that. I saw you two on all the gossip feeds. You seemed really happy together.”

“We were. It was a nice, clean separation; both still good friends.”

“Of course. Good. Great…” Hisashi and Nezu both shared a glance, neither daring to say a word. “Oh, and the other two. Midoriya and Jirou. I need to thank them. Where are they, anyway?”

  
  
  

***…~AMP~...***

  
  

**(****Outside of Ground Beta****)**

  
  

“Hell. Literal Hell.”

Izuku felt Kyouka’s chest vibrate against his back as she spoke. He was piggy-backing her out of the training grounds, their detention with Aizawa just ending.

“You still think he’s letting us off easy?”

“Mmmnnnngh…” Kyouka grumbled into Izuku’s back.

Aizawa had apparently made sure the construction bots never fixed the damage done by their fight with Bakugou. They had to take every piece of large rubble and run it to the clearing zone for the bots to clean up.

Which sounded simple enough…until he said “No One For All allowed.”

After that, he made them squat-lift trailers to semi-trucks. Thankfully, he was merciful enough to allow One For All, but they could tell he did so very begrudgingly. He did restrict Izuku’s percentages though.

Izuku lightly patted her thigh to keep her awake, his own eyes half-lidded as well. “Do you want to stop by the kitchen?”

“Mmmn, no. Bed. Just bed.”

“We’re gonna get in bed and you’ll be hungry. I’ll stop in the pantry, and you’ll need to grab everything you can carry.”

“We’ll grab a trash bag from under the sink.”

“I don’t think I can bend my knees that far right now. I’ll probably collapse.”

“Jacks.”

“Oh, right.”

Kyouka chuckled, softly kissing Izuku’s neck and nuzzling into him. Kyouka’s jacks perked up, hearing something moving around quickly…underground? She opened her eyes, her brow furrowing.

“...Izuku?”

“Hm?”

“...Who’s this?”

Izuku froze, looking down and moving his foot out of the way to see a face coming out of the ground with beady blue eyes. The face smiled as a hand came through next to him, waving at the couple.

“Hiya, Problem Children!”
