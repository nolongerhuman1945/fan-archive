“We couldn’t even make it ten minutes without something happening.” Izuku nodded at Kyouka’s words as they looked around the hallway. Dozens of students were all in their tracksuits waiting around the Class 1-A prep room. When Izuku and Kyouka arrived, Katsuki was still trying to make his way through.

“Outta my fucking way!” 

Kirishima, who was outside the door waiting for him, called out, “Ah, sorry about him. He’s not...Okay, he’s always like this.” He looked over to Katsuki, “C’mon, dude. Are you trying to start a war right before the festival?”

“I’m aiming for the top, so why should I care what the hell they think of me? They can “scope out the competition” or whatever all they want. It won’t matter when they lose.” He entered the prep room, slamming it behind him. Shaking his head, Kirishima followed him in. 

Kyouka hummed to her, “Scoping out the competition? I don’t know what they expect to see out here. It’s not like we can do anything.”

“Maybe they’re hoping to intimidate us.”  Izuku looked around at everyone, but his eyes landed on one tired-looking student looking straight at him. His wild, indigo hair stood out in the crowd. Izuku broke the stare, walking with Kyouka into the prep room with the rest of his class. 

“Some of those kids definitely aren’t in the hero course. Why would they care so much about this?”

“W-Well, it’s rare, but some people in other courses can perform so well th-that they can be transferred into the hero course.” They sat down at one of the empty tables, the chatter of the class emanating loudly. "And it works the other way around, too."

"Wait, so you're saying they're trying to replace us?"

"S-Seems like it." 

Kyouka sighed, "So, now we have even more to worry about. I'd say hopefully nothing else happens, but I know something wil-"

"Midoriya."

"There it is." They both turned to see Todoroki walk up to their table, his expression as blank as Kyouka's.

"I'm stronger than you, by most standards that is."

Kyouka scoffed, "Wow. Is everyone around here an arrogant asshole?"

Izuku stammered, not sure what to say, especially to someone he had never spoken to before. “U-Uh, I-I...I don’t-”

“Your quirk makes you stronger, faster, but you can barely use any of it or it’ll break you. Yet, for some reason, All Might has his eyes on you.”

“Wh-...What do y-you me-?”

“You were the only one who ran back into the USJ to help him, and when everyone was going home after the attack, you went to the teacher’s lounge. He always seems to be watching you specifically in class.” Izuku’s heart was pounding in his ears. He hadn’t been careful enough, and now everyone in earshot was hearing it. “I’m not going to pry about that. Not right now, that is. But, just know, I don’t care who’s in your corner. I will beat you.”

Eijirou came up behind Todoroki, putting a hand on his shoulder. “Dude, why’re you trying to pick fights right now? We’re about to go on.”

Shoto shook off the redhead’s hand, walking away. “I don’t care. I’m not pretending to be anyone’s friend around here.”

Kyouka stood up from her seat, but stopped as Izuku put a hand on her forearm. He pulled her back down to her seat, his stare directed at the table. “Izuku…” She could see he was terrified, but he was thinking. Which meant he was about to do something, that by Izuku standards, would be crazy. 

Izuku stood up, turning to Shoto. “I-I don’t know why y-you have it out for me all of a-a sudden.” He stopped, grimacing to himself as he tried to control his nervous stutter. “A-And I know you’re stronger than me. I know y-you’re more experienced than me. Everyone i-in this room is. Everyone out there is. But...B-But I-...” Izuku took a deep breath, most of the class was looking at him now, which didn’t help his anxiety in the slightest. He could feel his heart beating faster, his breath shallow. 

But, he knew he couldn’t stop. 

He *needed* to say it.

 For All Might. 

For Kyouka. 

And for himself.

“...I’ve been underestimated by everyone for my entire life. A-And, honestly, I’m sick and tired of it. Everyone in this room is aiming to win, to be the strongest hero, a-and that includes me, too. Th-Think of me what you will now, because that’s going to change today. I will *not* fall behind. I *will* fight with everything I have. I don’t care who against. Whether it be you…” Izuku steeled himself with all the courage he could possibly muster, his stomach threatening to betray him in that moment and vomit bile. He turned his head towards Katsuki. “...Or anyone else I have to compete against.”

Shoto raised a brow, but nodded. “...Right.”

Katsuki didn’t say anything, he only gave a look. It wasn’t an expression Izuku could immediately recognize, and he wasn’t given the chance. Katsuki turned away silently, looking at the wall as if it was the most interesting thing in the world.

Izuku sat back down, his heartbeat slowing, an oncoming panic attack narrowly avoided. “Dude…” Izuku turned to Kyouka at her words, her eyes wide. “Wh-...What was that?”

“I…”

“Midoriya!” Izuku jumped in his seat as his shoulders were grabbed by Ochako, who he didn’t even realize was in the room. “That was amazing! I’ve never heard you talk that much! And when you finally did, it was such a cool speech!”

Tenya came up behind Ochako, an impressed smile on his face. “I must also admit that rebuttal against Todoroki’s declaration of war was something else. Well done, Midoriya.”

“Th-Thanks guys. Excuse me.” Izuku stood up from his chair, heading for the door.

Kyouka looked at him curiously, “Where are you going?”

“To vomit in the bathroom.” Izuku exited the room, his footsteps quick. 

Kyouka stood up quickly, beginning to follow him. “I’ll be right back. I should check on him.”

Tenya nodded, “We’re to be called out in just a little over ten minutes. Be sure to be back by then.”

Kyouka waved in response, acknowledging she heard him. Thankfully, most of the crowd outside of their prep room had dissipated. Likely heading back to their own prep rooms. Kyouka looked around the hall once the door closed behind her, but Izuku was nowhere in sight.

“Bathroom’s that way.” Kyouka turned to one of the last students remaining from the original crowd, the indigo-haired boy. He was pointing left down the hallway. “Your friend looked like he was going to be sick, so I figure that’s where he’s headed.” 

“...Uh, thanks.”

Kyouka began walking down the hall, but was interrupted again. “You close to him?”

Without stopping, Kyouka responded, “I don’t think that’s any of your business.”

“Hmm, fair enough.” Kyouka vanished from sight around the corner, missing the smirk on Shinso’s face. “But, you basically just answered my question. Your assistance to my win is appreciated.” Stuffing his hands into his pockets, Shinso walked down the hall to his prep room.

…

Thankfully the nearest bathroom was a single toilet, so anyone was allowed in. That last thing she needed was Iida barking at her for entering the boy’s bathroom. 

*\*Knock\* \*Knock\**

“You already know who it is, Mop-Top.” All Kyouka received was a groan in response. “That’s about right.” She opened the door, closing it behind her and moving to sit on her knees next to Izuku, who was on his knees with his head just above the toilet bowl. Thankfully, U.A kept everything extremely clean. Kyouka began rubbing Izuku’s back in circles. “Did you get it all out?”

Izuku pulled his head up, spitting one last time into the water. “Th-There was nothing to get out except for bile. I-I didn’t eat breakfast because I was afraid I would throw up...But, I was still afraid this would happen, so I brought these.” Izuku pulled mints out of his pocket, making Kyouka crack a smile.

“Out of everything to be fully prepared for, you chose this. Come on.” Pulling Izuku to his feet, she brought him to the sink where he rinsed his mouth out and popped a couple of the mints in. Kyouka brought him to the door, lowering them down to sit against it. Their bodies were flush against each other, silence ringing in the small space. “What happened?”

“I guess...I-I guess I thought about what you said. Make it a message to everyone, and to myself. With what he said to me, I-I think it triggered that same feeling of being useless. I just started talking.”

“Dry Ice was being an asshole. And turning to Bakugou?”

“That was taking an opportunity when it arose. One I really hope I won’t regret.” 

“Did it feel good, though? To speak to him like that?”

“...Y-Yeah, it honestly did. It wasn’t like back during the battle training. Back then, I was riding my adrenaline of the fight. Once it was over, I-I was just as terrified as I was before the fight. B-But, that...right to his face, it felt...liberating. Although, I-I put away all my fear only for it to come back up and go right into the toilet...literally.”

Kyouka chuckled, taking Izuku’s hand. “It’s progress. Great progress. I don’t think you realize how proud of you I am right now.”

Izuku smiled, “Th-Thank you...I wouldn’t have been able to do that without your help.” They gazed at one another for a few seconds before touching their foreheads together. 

“You know, I’m so proud of you and I like you so much, that I’m honestly considering kissing you even with your puke breath.” Izuku quickly pulled out his entire roll of mints again, shoving all of them in his mouth and chewing quickly before swallowing. “...I like that effort.” She grabbed his face, bringing his lips down to hers. They kissed a few times before Kyouka pulled away. “Are we really about to do this on the bathroom floor?” 

“Y-...Yes?”

“...The things I do for you.” Their lips came together once more, their arms snaking around one another. If Kyouka didn’t want to be on the floor, Izuku would see to it that she didn’t have to. He hesitantly placed his right hand under her knees, a signal to ask permission. Kyouka didn’t seem to mind, so Izuku moved his hand under both of her knees, lifting her up and placing her in his lap. “Really going for it, huh?”

“I’m on a roll today. If I stop now I’ll collapse on myself.”

“Hey, I’m not complaining.” They continued softly pecking each other's lips until Present Mic rang out over the intercom.

*“First year students! Please head out to the stadium grounds!”*

The couple detached their lips, leaning their heads together, both of the breath ragged. Kyouka moved her hands from Izuku’s chest to his shoulders. “Ready?”

“Do I have a choice?” Chuckling, they stood up and left the bathroom, making their way back to the prep room to see their class heading towards the exit. 

“Ah, there you two are.” Tenya and Ochako approached them, the blue-haired teen motioning beckoning them. “C’mon, we’re starting.” Falling in line, they walked with the group, the light at the end of the tunnel approaching.

Uraraka turned to Izuku, “Are you okay, Midoriya? I mean, with my quirk you know I’m no stranger to losing your breakfast, but you seemed different.”

“Y-Yeah, just nervous is all.” Izuku looked around her to see Todoroki walking with Katsuki not too far away either. “...Very nervous.”

They reached the end of the tunnel, the crowds cheering and clapping as their appearance became known. Present Mic came in over the speakers, ***“And there’s your bunch, Eraser! Class 1-A! Any words of inspiration for your little ducklings?!”***

Aizawa suddenly spoke up over the mic, *“None of you embarrass me.”*

*“Wh-...Uh...* ***ALRIGHT!”***

Izuku cleared his throat, looking all around at the people in the stadium. “W-Wow, all th-these people…”

Kyouka nudged him and whispered, *“Hey, just focus on me. Alright?”*

*“I always am.”*

*“Ohoho, not bad. I need to catch up on these flirts. You’re a few points ahead of me.”*

*“...That was a flirt?”*

*“...You’ve gotta be kidding me, Izuku.”* After announcing the rest of the participating classes, all focus switched to the stage where Midnight was waiting to make further announcements. Immediately a ton of students began to gawk. Kyouka muttered to herself, “Why are any of them still phased by this? She’s been teaching us for weeks.” Kyouka then looked over at Izuku, his expression completely normal as he looked at Midnight with zero lust unlike most of the boys and some of the girls. Kyouka smirked, patting his head. “Good boy.”

“Hm? What do you mean?”

“Nothing. Just expressing my gratitude.” 

Kayama cracked her whip, quieting the crowd. “Alright, it’s time for the Athlete’s Oath! Given by none other than Katsuki Bakugou from Class 1-A.” Even with the cheers of the stadium crowd, groans could be heard from some of the other classes. 

Kyouka couldn’t help but groan as well, “Of course it’s him.”

Izuku nodded, “He scored highest out of all the entrance exams. At least, the practical portion. That’s probably why they picked him.”

A sigh escaped Kyouka’s lips, sarcasm dripping from her voice. “Well, this outta be good.”

Katsuki stepped up to the microphone, looking out at all the people. “...I’m going to win.” Kyouka rolled her eyes while spectators gasped in surprise and the other classes began to boo him. “Quit your whining, stepping stones!” That only made them boo louder.

Izuku was the outlier of the crowd, merely squinting in thought. Everyone accepted it as overconfidence, but Izuku knew better. The Katsuki Izuku knew would have said that with a wide smile, but he had made his declaration with an empty expression. He was pushing himself, trying hard to repeatedly tell himself he was going to win. Katuski walked down from the stage, purposely bumping into Izuku’s shoulder as he passed. 

After the quirk apprehension tests, and the battle training…

*‘...Is he actually scared I’ll win?’*

Midnight kept the show going, “You can’t deny the boy has confidence! Now, without further delay, the first event!” She motioned towards a large screen behind her, words appearing on the video. 

**Obstacle Course.**

“All eleven classes will be participating in a four kilometer race around the stadium to qualify for the next round!” She motioned to the side, a large gate opening up. Students quickly began moving to the starting line. “Our school preaches freedom in all things, which includes these challenges. So, as long as you don’t run out of bounds, anything is fair game! Runners, to the starting line! The race will begin in one minute!”

Izuku and Kyouka to the rest of the classes, both of them stretching out. Kyouka turned to Izuku, “Hey, don’t worry about me. You’re super fast, so just worry about doing your best.”

“A-...Are you sure? They said anything goes. You and I coul-”

“Mutter-Mouth, I seriously appreciate it. But, you shouldn’t worry about me.”

“No,” Izuku said, his voice uncharacteristically stern. “We said we’d do our best together. No matter how the events differ every year, one thing remains the same. O-Only the final event is one-on-one. B-But, right now, we can do this together. I-I...I’ll give everything I have, but I want you with me when I do it. W-We can tell the world we are here...Together.”

Kyouka was caught off guard, but couldn’t help but crack a smile. “Huh...You were serious about that hero duo thing?”

“Oh! W-Well, I-I mean, I haven’t thought about it seriously, b-but...I really like the idea. Everyone else will be fighting alone here. If w-we have each other, then we have an advantage.”

Kyouka scoffed in amazement, her smile widening. “Alright, Deku. Together it is.”

“S-So...need a ride?”

Midnight’s whip cracked again, “Runners! On your marks!” He breathed in deep, his body beginning to glow. He put in just enough power to where his body began to sting, but the pain was very bearable. “Get set!” 

Izuku crouched into runner’s positions, Kyouka quickly hopping onto Izuku’s back. Who knew her favorite form of travel would come in handy during such a time? Present Mic suddenly yelled out over the speakers, **“Woah! What’s this!? Izuku Midoriya and Kyouka Jirou of Class 1-A have formed an alliance!”** The crowd suddenly perked up, and many of the runners turned around to see what that meant.

“GO!”

*\*Zoom\**

In a flash of green light, Izuku and Kyouka rushed through most of the crowd. But, Izuku lost his balance as he went through the gate, ice had formed from on the ground, stopping many students in their tracks. Before he could fall on his face, Kyouka shot out her jacks into the ground behind them, keeping Izuku upright. “Todoroki’s trying to sabotage everyone! Don’t let him get us again!”

Izuku, with fully regained footing, sparked with more light. “Got it!” Izuku rushed off again, quickly passing the rest of the students in an instant. Izuku’s world was in slow motion as he turned his gaze to his right. He caught the wide eyes of Katsuki staring at his electrically charged former victim, who was even faster than before. Izuku switched his gaze back to the race, running ahead in an instant.

“Ah! What th-?” Kyouka felt a heavy tug on her left jack, turning to see Mineta hanging off of it.

“Thanks for pulling me out of the ic-” Kyouka quickly retracted her jack, pulling Mineta in and punching him off. “OW! Why!” Mineta yelled as he rolled away with a bruised cheek.

Kyouka yelled back as they ran further away. “You know why!” Izuku suddenly came to a halt, dust clouding around as his feet skid through the dirt. “Woah! Why are we stop-...” Kyouka looked ahead, seeing multiple zero pointer bots and other villain bots in front of them. “...-ping.?”

“I-I’m stronger now, but I definitely can’t destroy a zero pointer without breaking my arms yet.”

“We don’t need to destroy them. We just have to get past them.”

“Get the hell off me!” The couple looked behind them, seeing Mineta attached to Todoroki’s leg by one of his purple balls. 

“C’mon, man! I have tiny legs! I can’t do this!” Shoto froze the ball, breaking it off and kicking Mineta away, to where he was suddenly slammed by one of the bots.

Kyouka immediately began laughing, “Pffft! Hahahahahahaha! Ahahahahahahahahaha! Oh my God, my day just got ten million times better!” 

***\*BOOM\****

“DEKU!” Back where the students were still trying to de-ice themselves, a large explosion erupted. Katsuki was firing at them like a torpedo...Except it was a torpedo that actively hated them.

“And now it’s worse. Run!” Izuku quickly began zipping around multiple villain bots, jumping over, around, and under them. Just as they were nearing the exit of the robot area, Todoroki’s ice traveled all the way to near the exit and froze over one of the zero-pointer bot’s tread wheels, causing it to tip over and begin falling. “Don’t stop!”

“What!? We’ll b-be crushed!”

“He wants us to stop! But we can make it!” Izuku shook his head in pure disbelief that he was going to go through with it. He charged forward, putting just the slightest amount more power into his body, his legs beginning to burn from the new strength. The sun was blocked out as the zero-pointer came closer to the ground. They were now completely under it, and it was mere meters from coming down on their heads. Kyouka shot her jacks out, planting them into the ground ahead of them. She grabbed and yanked on them as hard as she could, throwing both of them forward and tumbling into the dirt. 

***\*CRASH\****

They both jumped in surprise as the zero pointer crashed down just a little bit away from them. Present Mic once again came in over the announcements. **“Midoriya and Jirou just pulled a dangerous move! But they made it just before being crushed! Either they’re crazy, or just know they’re that talented!”**

Kyouka could hear more explosions and ice from across the bot. Going through Todoroki’s trap instead of letting it fall then going around it had bought them a couple more extra seconds. And in an event like this with the people they were up against, any amount of extra bought time was a miracle. 

“C’mon!” Izuku nodded in response, getting back up on his feet as Kyouka jumped back onto his back. Izuku burst off into another powered sprint, the next. A two-pointer was in the way of the exit, blocking them from leaving. “Toss me up and over!” 

Acting quickly, Izuku lowered his torso, allowing Kyouka to move up to his shoulders. He put his hands under her legs, throwing her up in the air and over the bot. Izuku kept it distracted as Kyouka landed in a roll, sending out one of her jacks to vibrate and destroy the joint of it’s back leg, and using the other to wrap around the head to pull it back. Izuku saw his opening, jumping up and punching through the metallic neck. He hopped off of the back of the bot, landing back down for Kyouka to hop on. Immediately, they were on their way again.

With the next area in sight, Izuku asked, “Are they close?”

Kyouka looked back, finding Todoroki sliding on his ice, Bakugou was a bit behind him, Iida wasn’t too either, some crazy looking pink-haired girl, and the rest of their classmates were further away, but could still be seen. “Just don’t turn around.” Izuku nodded, looking at the “The Fall” area. He could probably make the jumps between each pillar, but the others were gaining on him. And Katsuki could easily blast himself over the pit. He needed a faster way. Izuku looked at all the tightropes between each rock pillar, and a light bulb went off in his head. 

“Do you think your jacks are strong enough to support both of us now?”

“Do I have a choice?”

“Probably not.”

“Then, yes.”

“A-Alright, then here we…” Izuku raised his power by just the smallest amount, his leg threatening to cramp up on him, “GO!” Izuku leaped off from the edge, the pitch black pit below them as they flew past multiple pillars.

Kyouka shot her jacks out as far as she could, managing to get them around one of the tightropes near the end of the area. She gave them some slack near her head to not rip her ears off and grabbed onto them, gripping Izuku as tight as she could with her legs. They began to fall towards the pit, but were caught and swung by Kyouka’s jacks. Gaining momentum with their swing, Kyouka released her jacks from the tightrope, launching them towards the other side. Izuku barely managed to grab onto the ledge, hoisting them both up and continuing on their way. 

**“These two are unstoppable!”** Mic’s voice rang out. **“This is the first time in U.A history that two people have worked together to win the festival, and they sure are giving us a show!”**

 Back in the stadium, Toshinori watched in awe. He hadn’t gotten too involved with Izuku’s training for the festival, so everything the teen did was all new to him. And he knew Kyouka was a very capable young woman, especially if her quick, solo victory during battle training was anything to go by. But, together they had kept a large lead ahead of everybody, with both of them doing their part to get them to the finish line. 

Toshinori never expected to be rooting for two students.

The couple could see the end far in the distance, just one final stretch. They were going to make i-

**“And now for the minefield!”** 

Izuku’s eyes widened, quickly grinding to a halt just a few centimeters outside of the minefield. “That’s...that’s unfortunate.” There was no going around, no going over. They could only go through. Izuku looked behind them, seeing Todoroki halfway across the tightropes, and Katsuki was just about to start his first explosion boosted jump. “Any ideas?”

“Just one, but it’s slow.” Kyouka plugged in her jacks into the ground, vibrating them and focusing. “It’s not super clear, but I think I can sense the cavities the mines are in.” She quickly pointed to her far right, “Jump there.” Izuku trusted her, jumping far to where she pointed. Thankfully, no mines were set off. Kyouka plugged her jacks in again, trying to sense for open spots. They were able to continue this process for about a third of the field, until a sound they were dreading approached.

**\*BOOM\***

“DEKU!!!”

Izuku didn’t even bother turning around, he knew that meant Katsuki had seen him. Which also meant he was almost done with the tightropes. So, Todoroki was also probably almost done since while he was ahead of Katsuki, he was slower at that specific area. “K-Kyouka…?”

“There’s a spot in the center.” Izuku was about to jump, but stopped. He looked back and saw Katsuki and Shoto had both made it, running neck and neck to the minefield. “...Wait.” 

“Excuse me? What the hell do you mean “wait”? They’re right behind us.” 

“Obviously, U.A can’t kill us. And there are students from the general course and support course in this race. They have quirks that wouldn’t be able to withstand this race. Exactly how dangerous can these mines actually be? The most they would be able to do is concussive blasts.”

“Izuku…” Kyouka threw her arm back, pointing behind them. “They just threw giant robots at us, a pit deep enough where you can’t see the bottom, and now a literal minefield! I don’t think I want to take the gamble that U.A actually has some sanity left!” 

“It’s not a gamble. They actually can’t have lethal weaponry used against us. Not something so unmonitored.” Izuku looked back again, Katsuki and Shoto making their first steps on the minefield. “And we’re not the one’s who are going to set them off.”

…

“Hey IcyHot!” Shoto looked to his left, Katsuki to his side. They had managed to make it halfway across without setting off any of the mines. Shoto was mostly the lucky one, because Katsuki had basically flown above the ground with his explosions. “That dumbass declaration you made against Deku…” He aimed his hand at Shoto. “You made it to the wrong person!” 

He knocked Katsuki’s hand away just before the explosion went off. “Says the one losing the race to him.”

“Fuck off! That nerd isn’t going to win this stupid race. These damn mines don’t affect m-” As Katsuki said that, Izuku landed directly in front of them in the empty spot Kyouka scoped out. One of each of Kyouka's jacks were shoved directly into both teen’s ears. One in Katsuki’s left ear, and the other in Shotos’ right ear, making them stumble in shock. Izuku jumped up, putting one foot on each of the other two competitor’s chests, kicking off of them as Kyouka retracted her jacks. Katsuki and Todoroki fell back onto the ground, and Izuku quickly grabbed onto the ends of his girlfriend’s jacks to muffle the incoming blast of sound.

*\*Click\**

*\*Click\**

***\*BOOM\****

The mines that the two had dodged were set off, blasting the boys off to the side and assisting in the launch of Izuku and Kyouka. The couple began flying through the air, but without control. The blast wasn’t enough to get to the very end, so they were likely about to land directly on more mines. “Kyouka!” Hearing her cue, Kyouka shot her jacks out as far as she could and planted them just outside of the minefield. Izuku grabbed onto them, pulling hard to throw them further. They landed outside of the danger zone, both falling apart from each other and tumbling until they rolled to their feet to break out into a full sprint. 

They were in the final stretch.

Izuku bent his torso down as he ran, allowing Kyouka to hop back on. Back at the minefield, Katsuki and Shoto both recovered, getting back on their feet. Shoto began maneuvering around the mines, creating a thick sheet of ice directing to the exit. His efforts to disrupt the pressure mechanics of the mines were successful, running over the ice without setting off any more explosions. However, Katsuki was standing still, completely. He sat in shock, the idea of Izuku getting another victory over him just wasn’t computing. His expression turned from shock into a fierce glare, his eyes focusing on Izuku and Kyouka nearing the exit. And Shoto, the one who saw *Deku* as more of a threat than him, was going to finish second.

...No.

No.

Not. Fucking. Happening.

“RRRRAAAAAAAGGGGGHHHHHH!!!”

***\*BOOOOOOOM!!!\****

*\*Click\* \*Click\* \*Click\* \*Click\* \*Click\* \*Click\* \*Click\* \*Click\* \*Click\* \*Click\* \*Click\* \*Click\* \*Click\**

Izuku, Kyouka, and Shoto all turned their heads to see the entirety of the minefield engulfed in a fiery inferno, and a ball of bright, hot colors was shooting directly towards them. Katsuki had fired an explosion behind him so large it set off all the other mines in the field, blowing away everyone who had just managed to make it to the minefield and assisting in Katsuki’s launch, allowing him to move even faster. 

...And now he was coming right for them.

“Holy shit! GO!” Izuku didn’t need to be told twice. He didn’t know how much power he began to use. It was enough to feel like his muscles were on fire, his bones rattling. Which, to Izuku, was almost sad because he didn’t actually increase One For All by that much. But, it would have to do. 

Shoto had no way of getting completely out of the way, so he created ice in front of him and moved off to the side. Even that wasn’t enough, for he was still knocked off his feet with his ice shattering and melting as Katsuki passed him. 

The leading duo reached the tunnel, but the light from their pursuer was enveloping the darkness. It was almost as if they were still outside. The roar of the explosion was filling their ears, the heat from the combustion at their heels, and the end of the tunnel in the distance. Izuku knew it was now or never. 

He jumped forward, spinning around in the air. Time slowed as he saw the explosion of hellfire that Katsuki was, his hand reaching out mere centimeters from Izuku’s face. “You can’t fucking win!” His fierce eyes, the explosions ringing in his ears, something triggered in Izuku. He threw his hand out, grabbing Katsuki by the face and shoving back. 

“I ALREADY HAVE!” Katsuki screamed at Izuku’s retort, his own hand also finding Izuku’s face. They grappled, tumbling through the air until…

**“AND WE HAVE OUR WINNERS!!!”** Both boys froze, then hit the earth at full force. The trio flew out of the tunnel at full force, skidding across the dirt as plumes of smoke followed them. **“IZUKU MIDORIYA, KYOUKA JIROU, AND KATSUKI BAKUGOU, ALL FROM CLASS 1-A HAVE FINISHED FIRST! AND IT LOOKS LIKE SHOTO TODOROKI IS ON HIS WAY IN! You’ve got quite the lively bunch, Eraser!”**

**“Stop putting attention on me.”**

**“ALRIGHT!!!”**

 Finally, the student’s momentum gave out and they stopped. Izuku groaned as sat up, his face still warm from the blonde’s hands. He turned his head, seeing Kyouka a few feet from him.

“You just had to turn around, didn’t you?”

“S-Sorry.”

“Are you kidding me? If you didn’t he would’ve grabbed *me* . You took it for me. What do you think I keep you around for?” 

Izuku laughed, looking around to see Katsuki sitting up a few meters away, a scowl on his face. Whatever he did back there was not something Izuku had ever seen before. His suspicion from earlier was proving more and more to be true. The battle training had affected him more than Izuku originally thought...

Katsuki Bakugou was desperate.

**“Alright, our beautiful audience, it seems like we’re going to have to review some footage to see who exactly came out of the tunnel first. But, for now, turn your attention back to the tunnel to see the rest of our contestants arriving!”** Perking up at Mic’s words, Izuku turned to see people beginning to run through the gate. However, many of them looked to be covered in dirt and soot. Namely Iida and Uraraka, who made their way over to the duo. 

Ochako pumped her fists up and down, “You guys! That was amazing! You never said you would be working together like that!”

Kyouka scooched over to be directly next to Izuku, “I won’t take all the credit. It was this guy who was so adamant on it.”  

Iida sighed, “As disappointed I am about my placement, especially in a race of all things with my quirk, I must admit teamwork wasn’t something that crossed my mind in such an event. And it clearly proved fruitful. Perhaps it would have gotten me out of Bakugou’s blast range.” Iida began patting himself down, cleaning off all the excess dirt and debris on his clothes. “And, might I say, your speed has increased significantly, Midoriya. We should train together sometime. Perhaps a far more friendlier, safer race than whatever U.A concocted up.” 

“A-Ah, w-well...uh, sure…”

**“After reviewing the footage, we’ve found our winner. Even though they were working as a team, the next event requires set placements. No ties. So we’ve made the decision to simply place them based on which one of them passed through the gate first. And since her body technically entered the arena first, KYOUKA JIROU IS OUR FIRST PLACE WINNER!!!”** The crowd cheered loudly as Kyouka’s eyes widened. Kyouka looked up at the stadium wide screens, the video of her, Izuku, and Katsuki flying through the tunnel. Since Izuku turned around to stop Katsuki, her body passed through the gate first. 

Ochako grabbed Kyouka by the shoulders, shaking her wildly. “Jiroouu!!! That’s amazing!” 

 **“AND BY NO SURPRISE THE OTHER HALF OF OUR DYNAMIC DUO, IZUKU MIDORIYA, IS IN SECOND PLACE!”**

Then, Izuku was brought into the shoulder shaking, “Midoriyaaa!” 

Up in the teacher’s private viewing box, Toshinori smiled. *‘Second place doesn’t matter. Both of them would have been first if the rules didn’t require a set placement. He’s proven his strength, and ability to work well with others. I didn’t even think of that second one. Way to prove me wrong, kid...Or, should I say kids?”* Toshinori gazed down at Kyouka, her and Izuku managing to pry Ochako off of them. An idea was forming in his mind, but nothing concrete. He still needed to see how things played out. But, there was definitely potential.

**“AND IN THIRD PLACE WE HAVE THE EVER-AMBITIOUS KATSUKI BAKUGOU!”**

Izuku stood up, looking over to Katsuki. Their eyes met, neither saying anything as Shoto came into their peripheral. They stood in a triangle, all wide apart staring at one another. Katsuki with a silent anger, Shoto with a cold glare, and Izuku trying to muster up a serious stare as he tried to hide his anxiety...He was failing.

Kyouka placed a hand on Izuku’s shoulder, moving in front of him. “Hey, I’d ask if you’re all done measuring dicks, but you still have two more events to do that. So, focus on preparing for that instead.” Shoto turned away silently. Katsuki growled, but stuffed his hands in his pockets while walking away. “Those two need a hobby.” 

“I’m pretty s-sure hating me is their hobby.”

“Why the hell does Todoroki hate you? We’ve never even spoken to him.”

“At this point I’m beginning to believe I might just be a very hateable person.”

“Remaining  fourty-two contestants!” Everyone turned back to Midnight on the stage, her whip cracking loudly. “The first event has officially concluded. Now, onto the next event! **The Cavalry Battle**! You will all form teams of two to four, and will assemble into a horse and rider formation. The rules are simple. Use your quirks and abilities to snag other team’s headbands to gain their points and add them to yours. Each of you has been given a point value based on your placement in the previous event. Last place has five points, second to last has ten, and so on. However, to our first place winner…”

Kyouka inwardly flinched, *‘Oh no.’*

“Will be rewarded ten million points!” All eyes slowly moved over to Kyouka, and Kyouka had her head in her hands. Izuku stood beside her with wide eyes, already knowing he was going to be on Kyouka’s team, which meant he was a target, too. “You have fifteen minutes to form your teams! Good luck!”

Izuku and Kyouka looked at one another, and then back out at the sea of other students all staring directly at Kyouka.

Izuku asked, “S-So...our chances?”

“We’re screwed.”
