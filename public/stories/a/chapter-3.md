# Chapter 3

Pain wasn't the right word for what Aris experienced when Subject Zero-Seven made contact.

It was more like existing in every possible state simultaneously—alive and dead, solid and dispersed, present in this moment and also scattered across every second of his own timeline. He saw himself at fifteen, standing over the researcher's atomized remains. At thirty-seven, learning Russian in a Saint Petersburg brothel while winter howled outside. At ninety-eight, walking away from Berlin as the Wall came down.

All of it happening at once, layered over each other like photographs left too long in the sun.

The entity's consciousness pressed against his—not hostile, but drowning. A man named Alexei Kozlov who'd volunteered for experimental treatments because his daughter needed surgery he couldn't afford. They'd promised him enhanced abilities, a bonus payment, complete safety.

They'd lied about the last part.

The treatments had worked too well. His molecular structure had become unstable, existing in quantum superposition. He could feel himself dying and not-dying, screaming and silent, trapped between states with no way back to being simply human.

*Help me,* the consciousness begged. *Please, I can't hold on, I can't—*

Aris forced his awareness to contract, to find the center of himself beneath the chaos. His own abilities surged in response to the contact, energy meeting energy, and for a terrible moment he thought they might both dissolve into probability waves.

Then he understood.

Subject Zero-Seven wasn't just unstable—it was resonating at multiple frequencies simultaneously, unable to collapse into a single quantum state. Like a guitar string vibrating at every possible note at once, creating only noise.

But Aris could manipulate energy. Could change frequencies, alter vibrations, impose order on chaos.

If he was strong enough. If he could survive the feedback.

He reached into the maelstrom of competing quantum states and began to pull.

Irina watched the monitors in horror as the two figures in Section Seven merged into a sphere of white light that made the cameras scream static. Alarms blared across her control panel—containment field fluctuating, structural integrity warnings, electromagnetic readings spiking beyond the instruments' ability to measure.

"Kaine!" she shouted into the microphone. "Kaine, respond!"

Nothing but white noise.

The sphere pulsed, expanding and contracting like a heartbeat. Each pulse sent cracks racing across the concrete walls, up the stairwell, toward Level Six. Irina grabbed the emergency shutdown protocols, finger hovering over the button that would seal every blast door between here and the surface.

Wait. Just wait another second.

The sphere collapsed inward with a sound like thunder played backward.

When the cameras recovered, there were two distinct figures lying on the corridor floor.

One was Aris Kaine, curled on his side, smoke rising from his clothing.

The other was a man. Just a man. Naked, middle-aged, completely human. He wasn't moving.

Irina's hands flew across the keyboard, checking the quantum state analyzer. Normal matter. Stable atomic structure. No exotic energy signatures.

Subject Zero-Seven was gone. In its place was Alexei Kozlov, exactly as he'd been before the treatments.

"Oh my God," she whispered. "He did it. He actually—"

On the monitor, Aris began to move.

---

Standing hurt. Breathing hurt. Existing in a single quantum state felt like wearing clothes three sizes too small after walking around naked for years.

Aris braced himself against the wall and focused on the basics. Inhale. Exhale. Heart beating at one hundred forty beats per minute—too fast, bring it down. Core temperature elevated, skin tingling with residual electromagnetic discharge.

He'd forced Subject Zero-Seven's quantum waveform to collapse into a single state, pulling the scattered probability into coherence through sheer force of will and a significant amount of energy manipulation. The process had felt like trying to compress a star back into hydrogen atoms, except the star was a human consciousness and if he'd fucked up even slightly, both of them would have ceased to exist.

But it had worked.

Alexei Kozlov lay three meters away, breathing shallowly but steadily. Human. Alive. Saved.

Aris allowed himself exactly five seconds of satisfaction before his legs gave out and he sat down hard on the cracked concrete.

Irina's voice crackled from the speakers. "Kaine? Can you hear me?"

"Yeah." His voice sounded like he'd been gargling gravel. "I'm here."

"The entity—the subject—what did you do?"

"Turned him back into a person. He'll need medical attention. Probably a lot of therapy." Aris looked at his hands. They were shaking, energy still arcing between his fingers in tiny blue-white sparks. "How bad is the structural damage?"

"Level Seven is compromised but stable. The pulse when you... whatever you did... it caused some fracturing in the support pillars. Nothing immediately dangerous, but I wouldn't want to be down here during an earthquake."

"Noted." Aris pushed himself to his feet, swaying slightly. "I'm coming up. Can you have some blankets ready? Our friend is going to wake up confused and very naked."

He made his way back to the sealed door, Kozlov slung over his shoulder in a fireman's carry. The man weighed maybe seventy kilos, but right now it felt like hauling a boulder uphill. The energy expenditure from forcing a quantum collapse had drained Aris more thoroughly than any fight he'd been in.

Irina met him at Level Six with blankets, a first aid kit, and eyes full of questions she was smart enough not to ask yet. Together they got Kozlov onto a bench, wrapped and stable. His vital signs were weak but improving.

"He's going to make it," Irina said, checking his pulse. "I don't understand how, but he's completely stable. It's like the treatments never happened."

"The treatments did happen. I just convinced his atoms they'd rather be normal again." Aris accepted the bottle of water she offered and drank half of it in one go. The cold liquid helped ground him, pulled his scattered focus back together.

Irina studied him with the clinical detachment of a scientist observing an unexpected result. "You're not human either, are you? I mean, you look human, but what you just did—"

"I'm human enough." He pulled out the sat phone, checked for signal. Still working. "We need to get you and Kozlov out of here. Then I'm going to set charges and bring this whole facility down."

"Wait. My father's research—years of data, experimental records—"

"Is exactly why this place needs to burn." Aris met her eyes. "Your father was experimenting on people, Irina. Turning them into weapons. You want that research falling into someone else's hands?"

She looked away. "No. You're right. It's just..." She touched one of the monitors, displaying files and data streams. "It was his life's work. Everything he believed in."

"Then maybe he believed in the wrong things."

Harsh, but true. Aris had met too many brilliant people who'd justified atrocities in the name of progress. The world didn't need more of them.

He pulled up the sat phone's messaging interface. Time to check in with his employer.

*Survivor extracted. Anomaly neutralized. Ready for extraction when you are.*

The response came quickly. *Three hours. Northwest clearing, two kilometers from your entry point. Helicopter will be marked with blue smoke.*

*Understood. One additional passenger—male, mid-forties, needs immediate medical attention.*

*Approved. How did you neutralize the anomaly?*

Aris hesitated, fingers hovering over the keys. How much should he tell Natasha? She already knew he had abilities, but what he'd just done went beyond simple energy manipulation. He'd reached into the quantum structure of reality and reshaped it through will alone.

That kind of power made people nervous. Made them see you as a threat instead of an asset.

*Carefully,* he typed back. *Details when we meet.*

*Always so mysterious. Did you at least find anything useful before blowing it up?*

He looked at the rows of monitors, the data banks, the years of research into human enhancement and quantum manipulation. SHIELD would love to get their hands on this. So would HYDRA, AIM, the Ten Rings, and about a dozen other organizations that would use it to create more monsters.

*Nothing worth keeping,* he lied.

Well. Mostly lied.

Before Irina could notice, Aris pulled one of the USB drives from his tactical vest and plugged it into the nearest console. He navigated to a specific folder—Dr. Volkov's personal files, encrypted but not well enough to stop SHIELD's code-breaking algorithms—and began the download.

Not all of it. Just the sections dealing with "vibrational frequency manipulation" and something labeled "Project Genesis—Historical Context."

The download finished in ninety seconds. Aris pocketed the drive and began setting the demolition charges he'd brought in his pack. Standard SHIELD-issue thermite, enough to reduce the facility's data storage to slag.

"You have everything you need?" he asked Irina.

She clutched a small bag—personal items, probably. "Yes. Nothing I can't replace."

"Good. Help me get Kozlov upstairs."

They made slow progress, Aris bearing most of the man's weight while Irina steadied them both. By the time they reached the surface, Aris's muscles were screaming and the early afternoon sun felt like a physical blow after the dim emergency lighting below.

Fresh air. Mountains. Sky.

He'd never been so grateful to see snow.

Kozlov stirred as they laid him in the back of the SUV, blankets piled around him. His eyes opened—normal brown, no quantum superposition—and focused blearily on Aris.

"My... daughter," he rasped in Russian. "Katya. Need to... call her."

"You'll see her soon," Aris promised. "Just rest."

"They said... said I'd be a hero. Help my country." Kozlov's laugh was bitter, broken. "Made me a monster instead."

"You're not a monster anymore. That part's over."

The man's eyes drifted closed. Within seconds, he was asleep, body finally surrendering to exhaustion now that existence no longer required conscious effort.

Aris activated the remote detonator. Deep underground, thermite charges ignited, burning at over two thousand degrees. Metal melted. Data banks liquefied. Years of research dissolved into pools of slag.

He felt the heat bloom even from here, a spike in the thermal signature that made his abilities sing with sympathetic resonance. So much energy, all that contained potential being released at once.

Part of him wanted to reach out, to pull it in, to feed on it until he was drunk with power.

He forced the impulse down. That way lay the same madness that had created Subject Zero-Seven.

"We should go," Irina said quietly. "Before the smoke attracts attention."

They drove in silence, Aris navigating the mountain roads while Irina stared out the window and Kozlov slept in the back. The facility burned behind them, a pillar of smoke rising into the clear winter sky.

Good riddance.

---

The extraction point was exactly where Natasha had indicated—a clearing carved from dense pine forest, flat enough for a helicopter to land. Aris parked the SUV at the tree line and checked his watch. Twenty minutes early.

He spent the time in the driver's seat, eyes closed, trying to process what he'd done in Section Seven. Collapsing a quantum waveform shouldn't have been possible. The amount of precision required, the energy expenditure, the sheer improbability of success—any one of a hundred variables could have killed them both.

But he'd known it would work. Known it with the same certainty he'd known how to atomize that researcher eighty-three years ago.

Because he'd done it before.

Not consciously. Not deliberately. But the first time his abilities had manifested, he'd been dying—a normal human boy, sick with something the doctors couldn't diagnose, failing one system at a time. And then suddenly he wasn't dying. Suddenly every cell in his body was humming with energy, stable and coherent and very much not ten years old anymore.

Someone had collapsed his quantum waveform into a viable state.

The question was who.

"Kaine." Irina's voice pulled him from his thoughts. "The helicopter."

He looked up. Sure enough, a black chopper was descending into the clearing, side door already opening. Blue smoke grenades marked the landing zone, exactly as promised.

Natasha Romanoff stood in the helicopter's doorway, red hair pulled back, tactical gear pristine despite the mountain wilderness. She jumped down before the skids even touched ground, moving with the fluid efficiency Aris had come to expect from her.

"You look like shit," she said by way of greeting.

"You say the sweetest things." Aris opened the SUV's rear door and gestured at Kozlov. "Our quantum anomaly, now helpfully returned to normal physics. He's going to need medical care and probably witness protection—HYDRA won't be happy their experiment escaped."

Two SHIELD medical personnel moved past them with a stretcher, loading Kozlov with practiced efficiency. Natasha watched them work, then turned her attention to Irina.

"Dr. Volkov's daughter?"

"Yes." Irina straightened under the scrutiny, trying for professional despite her exhaustion. "Irina Volkov. Biophysicist. I was... I worked on Project Resonance under duress."

"We'll need a full debrief." Natasha's tone suggested this wasn't a request. "Everything you know about the facility, the experiments, who was funding it."

"Of course. I'll tell you everything."

Natasha gestured toward the helicopter. "Agent Morse will take your statement in flight. We're going to a safe location where you can rest and recover before the formal interview."

Irina glanced at Aris, uncertain. He nodded. "Go ahead. You're safe with them."

She followed the agents to the helicopter, leaving Aris and Natasha alone in the snow.

"So," Natasha said. "Want to tell me what really happened down there?"

"I found a man who'd been turned into a quantum probability wave. I turned him back. The end."

"Bullshit." She stepped closer, eyes searching his face. "I've read reports on quantum mechanics. You can't just 'turn back' a quantum state. That's not how physics works."

"Maybe I'm just that good."

"Or maybe you're something more than a freelance thief with energy manipulation abilities." Her voice dropped, not threatening but serious. "I vouched for you, Kaine. Told my superiors you could be trusted. Don't make me regret that by lying to my face."

Aris met her gaze, saw the calculation there. Natasha Romanoff was deciding whether he was an asset or a threat. The wrong answer here could end with a bullet—she'd proven in Budapest that she didn't hesitate when necessary.

"I don't fully understand it myself," he said, which was true enough. "But yes, I have abilities beyond what I told you. Quantum manipulation, apparently. Energy absorption and redirection. Maybe more. I'm still figuring it out."

"How long have you had these abilities?"

"Long enough to know when to use them and when to walk away."

"That's not an answer."

"It's the only one you're getting today." He softened it with a slight smile. "I did the job, Romanoff. Got your survivor out, neutralized the threat, destroyed the facility. The details of how shouldn't matter."

She studied him for a long moment. Then, surprisingly, she nodded.

"Fine. For now." She turned toward the helicopter. "You're riding back with us. Director Fury wants to meet you."

Aris's stomach dropped. "That wasn't part of our deal."

"The deal was extraction and payment. You'll get both. But when someone demonstrates abilities that can rewrite quantum mechanics, the director likes to have a conversation. Just a conversation."

"SHIELD conversations have a funny way of turning into indefinite detention."

"Only if you give us a reason." Natasha paused at the helicopter's door. "Look, I know you're careful. I know you've stayed off the grid for a reason. But you just saved two people from a nightmare most humans can't even comprehend. That means something. Maybe it's time to stop running."

"I'm not running. I'm being strategically mobile."

"Right. Well, your strategy now includes a debrief with Nick Fury. Non-negotiable."

Aris weighed his options. He could refuse, walk away, disappear back into the grey market where SHIELD couldn't easily reach him. But that would mean making an enemy of Natasha, losing access to SHIELD resources, and burning a bridge he might need later.

Or he could get in the helicopter, meet with Fury, and navigate whatever came next.

"Where?" he asked.

"New York. The Triskelion." She extended a hand to help him up. "Twenty-four hours, in and out. You have my word."

Her word. Aris considered that. He'd seen Natasha fight, seen her make hard choices under pressure. She operated in shades of grey but she had a code. When she said something, she meant it.

He took her hand.

The helicopter lifted off, carrying them over the Caucasus Mountains as the burning remains of Object 47 faded into the distance. Inside the cabin, Irina was already giving her statement to Agent Morse, words tumbling out in a cathartic rush. Kozlov slept on his medical stretcher, vitals stable on the monitors.

Natasha sat across from Aris, studying him with that unnerving intensity of hers.

"You want to know what I am," he said quietly, pitched below the helicopter's noise so only she could hear.

"I want to know if you're dangerous."

"Everyone's dangerous. Question is whether I'm dangerous to the right people."

"And are you?"

Aris thought about the researcher who'd died screaming silently as his atoms came apart. About the HYDRA operatives he'd killed over the years, the weapons he'd kept out of circulation, the innocents he'd saved without anyone ever knowing his name.

"I try to be," he said.

Natasha nodded slowly, apparently satisfied with that answer. She leaned back, closed her eyes, and within minutes was asleep—the practiced rest of someone who'd learned to grab downtime wherever they could find it.

Aris wasn't so lucky. His mind kept circling back to Section Seven, to the moment when he'd been connected to Subject Zero-Seven's consciousness. In those few seconds of contact, he'd felt something else. A resonance deeper than quantum mechanics.

He'd felt recognition.

Alexei Kozlov's treatments hadn't come from nowhere. The technology, the understanding of quantum states and vibrational frequencies—someone had pioneered that research decades ago. Someone who'd successfully created a stable quantum being who could manipulate energy at a fundamental level.

Someone who'd created Aris.

He pulled out the USB drive he'd copied from Volkov's files and turned it over in his fingers. Project Genesis—Historical Context. Maybe the answers were here. Maybe this was finally the lead he'd been searching for since 1952, when he'd woken up in that burning facility with abilities he couldn't explain and memories that didn't quite fit.

Or maybe it was just another dead end in a lifetime of dead ends.

The helicopter banked east, chasing the sunset toward Russia's border. Below, the Caucasus Mountains stretched endlessly, beautiful and indifferent. Aris pocketed the USB drive and tried to sleep.

It didn't work.

---

Nick Fury's office in the Triskelion occupied the top floor with windows overlooking the Potomac River. The man himself stood with his back to the door when Aris was escorted in, hands clasped behind him, eye patch prominent against his dark skin.

"Mr. Kaine." Fury didn't turn around. "I've been reading about you."

"All good things, I hope."

"Depends on your definition of good." Now he turned, single eye fixing on Aris with predatory focus. "You've operated in the grey market for nine years. Sold weapons to people who probably shouldn't have them. Stolen from governments, corporations, and terrorist organizations with equal enthusiasm. You're not exactly a Boy Scout."

"Never claimed to be." Aris remained standing, noting the positions of every exit, every potential weapon in the room. Old habits. "But I have standards. I don't sell to human traffickers, I don't deal in WMDs, and I've been known to tip off law enforcement when I stumble across something genuinely horrific."

"How noble." Fury circled to his desk, each movement deliberate. "Agent Romanoff says you turned a quantum anomaly back into a human being. Want to explain how that's possible?"

"Not really."

"Try anyway."

Aris shrugged. "I manipulate energy. The subject was in an unstable quantum state—multiple energy frequencies competing for dominance. I imposed order, collapsed the waveform, returned him to a stable configuration. Basic thermodynamics."

"Bullshit. I've got three PhDs telling me what you described violates at least four laws of physics."

"Then your PhDs aren't thinking creatively enough."

Fury's expression didn't change but Aris felt the temperature in the room drop about ten degrees. This was a man who'd stared down Asgardian gods and alien invasions. A freelance operator with a smart mouth didn't intimidate him.

"Let me be clear about something," Fury said quietly. "I appreciate what you did in the Caucasus. You saved lives, prevented a potential quantum catastrophe, and did it without creating an international incident. That buys you some goodwill. But don't mistake my gratitude for trust."

"Wouldn't dream of it."

"I don't like unknowns, Kaine. And you're a very large unknown. No records before 2003. Abilities that shouldn't exist. A lifespan that—according to our facial recognition analysis of historical photographs—might extend considerably longer than a normal human's."

Aris kept his expression neutral, but inside his pulse quickened. SHIELD had been digging. Had they found the photograph from 1967? The one from 1983?

"You think I'm some kind of enhanced individual," he said carefully.

"I know you're an enhanced individual. Question is what kind and what you want."

"What I want is to be left alone to do my job."

"Can't do that. You're too dangerous to ignore and potentially too useful to alienate." Fury tapped a file on his desk. "So here's my offer. You work with SHIELD occasionally. Freelance basis, your choice of assignments. We pay well, provide resources, and keep our interest in your past to a polite minimum."

"And if I refuse?"

"Then we keep digging. Trace every job you've done, every identity you've used, every anomaly in the historical record that might explain what you are. Eventually, we'll find answers. The question is whether you want to be involved in that process or opposed to it."

It wasn't quite a threat. More like a statement of inevitable fact delivered with perfect calm.

Aris had to admit, he respected the directness.

"I'll consider it," he said. "But I'm not signing anything, I don't take orders, and if one of your assignments crosses a line I'm not comfortable with, I walk. No questions, no consequences."

"Fair enough." Fury extended a hand. "Welcome to SHIELD's Rolodex, Mr. Kaine."

They shook. Fury's grip was firm, brief, professional.

"Agent Romanoff will coordinate with you on future operations. You have any questions, you go through her."

"One question." Aris met Fury's gaze. "The Battle of New York. The Avengers. How much of the weird shit do you people deal with on a regular basis?"

"More than I'd like, less than I'm prepared for." Fury's expression might have been a smile. Hard to tell. "Why? You worried about job security?"

"Just want to know what I'm getting into."

"Son, if you're worried about that, you're already in too deep."

Probably true.

Aris left the office, escorted by a silent agent back through the Triskelion's labyrinthine corridors. Natasha waited in the lobby, leather jacket over civilian clothes, looking less like an operative and more like someone meeting a friend for coffee.

"How'd it go?" she asked.

"I'm either employed or under surveillance. Possibly both."

"Welcome to SHIELD." She gestured toward the exit. "Come on. I owe you that drink."

They found a bar two blocks from the Triskelion, the kind of place that catered to government workers looking to forget about their day. Natasha ordered vodka. Aris went with whiskey.

"So," she said, settling into the booth. "Fury's recruited you. How does that feel?"

"Like I've made a terrible mistake that'll seem perfectly reasonable in hindsight."

She smiled. Actually smiled, not the professional expression she used on marks but something genuine. "Yeah, that's pretty much the SHIELD experience."

They drank in comfortable silence for a moment. The bar was half-full, conversations providing white noise that made their booth feel private despite the crowd.

"Can I ask you something?" Aris said.

"Depends on the question."

"Budapest. We were both after the same target. You shot him before I could get the information I needed. Then you disappeared. Why?"

Natasha studied her vodka like it held answers. "The target was a Red Room operative. Former instructor. He had information about sleeper agents SHIELD needed to neutralize."

"And my interest?"

"You were looking for information about Project Genesis. Something about human experimentation, super soldier programs, historical records." She met his eyes. "I thought you were a HYDRA asset trying to rebuild their enhancement projects. Shooting the target protected SHIELD interests and yours. You got to walk away without having to kill someone."

"How considerate."

"I looked into you after that. Realized you weren't HYDRA, just... looking for something. Something personal." She paused. "What is Project Genesis, Kaine? What are you really searching for?"

The honest answer would require explaining things he'd never told anyone. The USB drive burning a hole in his pocket. The gaps in his memory. The way he didn't age the same as other people.

"Answers," he said instead. "Same thing everyone's looking for, I guess."

Natasha accepted that with a nod, apparently understanding that some conversations weren't ready to be had. She finished her vodka and signaled for another round.

"Fury's going to want to run tests," she said. "Confirm what you can do, establish baselines, all that fun stuff. You don't have to agree, but it would help if we ever need to deploy you with a team."

"I work alone."

"So do I. Until I don't." She accepted the fresh vodka from the bartender. "The world's getting weirder, Kaine. Aliens in New York, gods from Asgard, enhanced individuals popping up everywhere. SHIELD's trying to stay ahead of it, but we're only human. Having people like you on call? That's how we survive what's coming."

"And what's coming?"

"I don't know. But I guarantee it'll be something we're not prepared for."

Aris thought about Alexei Kozlov, transformed into a quantum anomaly by people who thought they could control forces they barely understood. Thought about the facility full of dead researchers who'd learned too late that some experiments shouldn't be run.

"All right," he said. "I'll do the tests. But only the basic ones. You don't get tissue samples, you don't get brain scans, and if anyone tries to extract my DNA without permission, I'm walking."

"Deal." Natasha raised her glass. "To bad decisions and stranger bedfellows."

"I'll drink to that."

They clinked glasses. Outside, Washington DC settled into evening, the Triskelion's lights reflecting off the Potomac like fallen stars. Somewhere in that building, Nick Fury was probably already planning Aris's next assignment.

And somewhere in Russia, a man named Alexei Kozlov was waking up human again, given a second chance by someone who understood what it meant to be someone's experiment.

Aris pulled out the USB drive later, alone in the SHIELD-provided hotel room. Plugged it into his laptop and began reading through Dr. Volkov's files on Project Genesis.

The historical context section referenced research from 1949. A facility in upstate New York. Experimental treatments designed to create "stable quantum beings capable of manipulating fundamental forces."

Subject Zero. First successful test. Survived the process. Status: escaped during facility destruction, current whereabouts unknown.

Aris stared at the screen, pulse pounding in his ears.

1949. Upstate New York. Subject Zero.

He'd been Subject Zero.

And someone, somewhere, had the records to prove it.
