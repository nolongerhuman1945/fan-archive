**A/N: This is a pretty All Might and Hisashi heavy chapter. Izuku and Kyouka's training is fairly in the background in this one, but I definitely want to focus on it next time. Them working together as a unit is legitimately important.**

**While I can't say for sure, next chapter is probably the climax of the Lady Nagant Arc. Not the end, per say. But, the climax. It'll probably be pretty long, so gimme some time.**

**At first, I thought that the arc was kinda short. About the lenght of Stain and Hosu.**

**...But, then I remembered that Kaina's first mention in this story was about 25 or so chapters ago. This whole arc has been slowly building for a very long time.**

“Hawks? W-Wow, it’s an honor! Truly.” Hisashi bowed down before continuing, “What are you doing here?”

*“Ah, shit…”* He heard Toshinori through his earpiece. 

“Ah, just came here on a case. Nothing too serious, I don’t think. I didn’t think I’d find anyone down here this early,” Hawks shrugged. “Figured I’d come early. I was never big on the staff pestering me about disorganizing their files.”

“Forgive me, but I’m struggling not to make an ‘early bird gets the worm’ joke.”

“Ah, yeah. Hehe…Totally never heard that one before. Anyway, whatcha doing down here?”

“I work here,” Hisashi just shrugged again. Perhaps he was jumping to conclusions, but Hawks had to be sent here. Heroes weren’t allowed to just access records without an HPSC worker, police, or a warrant. 

“Well, yeah, I’d hope so. But, you’re not one of the usuals I see down here.”

“Working on an investigation of my own.”

“Ah, cool. Cool. On your own? Don’t need any help?”

“I’ve been doing this a long time.”

“Sure, but this isn’t some cop shop. This is the HPSC. I can’t think of any investigation that came through here that didn’t involve a team of at least three or four people and a Pro. What’s it about, anyway?”

…Yeah, he was sent here.

“Hasn’t hit the news, yet. Can’t say anything, meant to be kept quiet.”

“Ah, c’mon. This will sound like a brag, but I’m Number Two. I always got time to help. If it’s a juicy case, I might have lucked out and got first dibs. I can take a look at that and-”

“Top secret, I’m afraid. Besides, I…I actually am working with a Pro already.”

“Really? From who? If you say Endeavor, I’m gonna beg to join this case even more.”

“...All Might,” Hisashi answered. 

Both Hawks and All Might perked up, with the ladder coming through on the ear piece, *“What the hell are you doing?”*

“All Might?” Hawks scoffed with faux disbelief. “Yeah, right. He’s retired.”

“You wanna talk to him?” Without hesitation, Hisashi pulled out his phone and hit speaker. “I’ve been on call with him. He didn’t wanna come inside, too much attention, you know? Not to mention recording all of our conversations, just in case they can be used later. All Might, you there?”

Toshinori faltered for a moment, but quickly caught on, *“Uh-? Yes! Yes, I’m here! That voice…Is that Hawks? Been quite some time since we’ve spoken, my boy!”*

Hawks didn’t know what to say for a moment. He didn’t expect this guy to just flat out admit it. “...All Might? What’s up, man? Good to see retirement hasn’t made you lazy.”

“ *Bah, retirements too boring. I spent thirty years in action, so I don’t know what it’s like to live without it. But, anyway, we shouldn’t keep you. We’ve got plenty of work to do.”*

“Right,” Hisashi nodded. “I’m a huge fan, Hawks. Really, I am. But, I can’t just talk about my investigations with anybody. You never know who you can trust these days…”

They stared at one another, Hawks’s hands basically tied. Whoever this guy was, while not very subtle about it, he knew. He just flashed his immunity card. Anything happened to him, and everything went down the drain.

…He had to let him walk.

“Nah, I get it. Especially after last night. Someone trying to snipe you would get you pretty paranoid. Anyway, I won’t keep you. Got some investigating to do myself,” Hawks chuckled, patting Hisashi’s arm as he walked past him. “Have a good one, Midoriya.”

Hisashi both breathed a sigh of relief as Hawks walked away, but internally cursed. 

He never told him his name.

Hawks knew that the moment he showed up, he’d be suspect number one. But, then he couldn’t kill Hisashi. So, now he was just trying to scare him. 

…Which technically worked.

But, being scared wouldn’t stop him. 

Hisash turned off his speaker phone as he made it to the door, exiting out into the hallway and heading for the elevator. Toshinori sighed over the line, *“...This isn’t good.”*

“Not even a little bit.”

Back in the Records Wing, Hawks leaned against one of the shelves, phone against his ear, “...Yeah, we’ve got a problem.”

  
  
  

***~...AMP…~***

  
  

**(** **Parking Lot** **)**

  
  

Hisashi got into his car, finding All Might sitting with his head in his hands. “That was fast. *Way* too fast. Her name had to be tagged, right?”

Hisashi shrugged as he started his car, “Very possible, but there’s also the unfortunate possibility that he’s been following us all day. Don’t look around, he could be watching us right now. If he’s a trained assassin, you won’t see him anyway.”

“Shit…”Toshinori shook his head, casually glancing out the window as the car began to move. “...I remember when I first met Hawks. He was just a kid, and…He came up to me in the lobby of this very building. He was with a man, they were acting suspicious…It was right in front of my face.”

“You couldn’t have known.”

“No, I couldn’t have. But, hindsight still doesn’t make it feel any better. He’s always seemed like such a good man.”

“Well, if Nagant’s story is anything to go by, maybe he is. Maybe he’s trapped, like her.”

“I truly hope so. Having the Number Two hero be an assassin is horrifying. People won’t know who to trust.”

“Paranoia like that is the HPSC’s nightmare.”

“How’d you know that would work, by the way?” Toshinori looked back over at Hisashi. “Telling Hawks about me, I mean.”

“If he knows about us, then our only playing card is to show him that we know about him,” Hiasashi shrugged. “He could’ve…uh, ‘tried to stop me’ to hide their secrets, but now you know who he is. If I was alone, you would still be a problem for them, but Hawks himself would still be a secret. Taking me down while on call with All Might is an instant no-go. Now, the person they really don’t want after them knows who their new assassin is.”

“Doesn’t that just leave us stalemated?”

“More or less. Let’s see what we’ve got first. Would you say UA is safe from the HPSC’s prying eyes and ears?”

“Pfft! Nezu is more likely to be spying on us than the HPSC.”

“Great, the-...” Hisashi faltered, flicking his gaze over at Toshinori in confusion before deciding to just move past that. “Great, let’s head there. Might be a good time to break the news to Izuku.”

Toshinori's eyes widened for a second, clearing his throat, “A-Ah, he’s got a lot on his mind right now…”

“I know, but I don’t want there to be secrets. I’ve just involved myself in something serious, it could affect him.”

Toshinori did his very best to not seem suspicious, but he knew Izuku really didn’t wanna deal with anything else at the moment. The poor kid was going through enough, and Toshinori was already throwing the Nagant case on him at the worst possible time. He probably just wanted to be left alone.

Well, his definition of alone meant with Kyouka. 

“He’s probably riding pretty high right now after getting his license. Those kids already have so much weight on their shoulders. Let’s handle things ourselves, just for another day.”

Hisashi sighed, “Ah, I guess you’re right. Maybe after our get-together with Jirou’s parents. You should come, actually. It might make explaining things a little easier.”

“...I’m getting tired of facing off against parents.”

“Huh?”

“I mean, yeah! Sure, I mean I roped you into all this. I should be there to explain myself.” Toshinori looked into the side-view mirror, keeping his eye on the sky, “...And, to face any of the consequences.”

  
  
  
  

***~...AMP…~***

  
  

**(** **Recovery Girl’s Office** **)**

  
  

“Why is it always you two?”

Izuku and Kyouka stared back at Recovery Girl as she walked in, sitting in an almost identical position to when they first met; side-by-side in the center of the room. 

Kyouka smiled innocently back, “We keep you busy.”

She rolled her eyes, making her way over to the two, “At least you don’t break your arms this oaf.”

“Wh-? H-Hey,” Izuku put his hands up in exasperation, “I’ve been doing really well. I only broke my arms at camp because I had no other choice.”

“Mm, I suppose it’s a much better excuse than fighting your classmate.”

Kyouka just grumbled, “He started it.”

“Knowing that boy? Probably. However…” Chiyo hopped up on a stool and pecked Kyouka’s cheek, her bruises slowly fading away. “You have too much to risk with petty squabbles. The last thing any of us need is for you two to get in trouble and hinder your education and training. I still have no idea how this whole ‘split’ thing happened with you two, and I’m not even going to ask. What matters now is that it happened, and that we need you both at the top of your game.”

“...Yes, ma’am,” the couple responded, both with a sigh. 

“You two just got your licenses,” Chiyo said as she hopped down, moving over to her desk to grab some candy. “Which also means you have Work Studies coming up. You’re lucky Aizawa is a lot softer than he acts, or else you would’ve had both of those things revoked.”

Izuku’s eyes widened, “I completely forgot about work studies. I don’t know what we’re gonna do for that. Torino is busy trying to find the League, and I doubt All Might will have the time to do a Work Study. We won’t be able to train together properly if we’re working under people who don’t know about One For All.”

Kyouka raised a brow, “I guess there’s…Aizawa?”

The couple just looked at one another, both shuddering at the mere thought. Chiyo hummed as she handed Kyouka a little bag of gummy bears, “I suppose you could have them call Mirai. He runs a Work Study program.”

“Nighteye?!” / “All Might’s sidekick?” Izuku and Kyouka asked, respectively. 

“That’d be amazing!” Izuku smiled, the sparkle of fanboyism in his eyes. “I knew he started his own agency, but I didn’t know he had a program. I was actually hoping he would give me an offer back at the Sports Festival.”

Chiyo pursed her lips, shifting her eyes from Izuku, “That’s probably because Toshinori and Mirai unfortunately haven’t been on the best terms as of late.”

“What?” Izuku asked, concerned and leaning forward in his seat. “Why?”

“...”

“...”

“...”

“...It’s because of me, isn’t it?”

“Not…entirely.”

Izuku just put his head in his hands as Kyouka reached over and rubbed his back. She put her arm around him and used her other hand to rub his arm, “Hey, if it makes you feel any better, he’s probably gonna hate me even more.”

Izuku shook his head, his eyes returning to Recovery Girl, “I’ll take a wild guess and say that he wasn’t keen on me as All Might’s successor.”

Chiyo waved it off dismissively as she sat down at her desk, “Don’t you worry about Mirai. He’s a good man, but he’s always been a little…Well, Mirai. He’s rather protective of All Might, in his own way. He means well, but at the end of the day it wasn’t his decision. And, it was the right one. He’ll see. It might just take him a little bit. He was always a little wary of new people being added to the…What does Toshinori call it? The ‘Circle of Trust’?” 

“What about me?” Kyouka asked. “What are the chances he’s gonna react to me being included, much less also being a part of One For All?”

“...” Chiyo remained silent, hissing through her teeth as she turned back to her computer.

Kyouka sighed, dragging her hand down her face, “First Torino, now him. Fantastic.”

It was Izuku’s turn to rub Kyouka’s back, his mind latching onto something Recovery Girl had said. She had known All Might for a long time; long enough to know that Nighteye wasn’t a fan of new people learning the secret of One For All. “...Recovery Girl, did you know Lady Nagant?”

Chiyo faltered, spinning around in her chair to look at Izuku, “I haven’t heard that name in years. Has Toshinori been telling you stories?”

Izuku pursed his lips, opting not to explain the whole ‘rummaging through All Might’s memories’ thing. “In a sense. He’s been working on a case for her.”

“Of course he has,” Chiyo sighed. “Kaina was a very sweet woman. Calling it obvious that Toshinori had feelings for her is the understatement of the century. But, that old coot Torino convinced him to keep quiet about it. It didn’t help that Mirai and her never got along that much.”

Kyouka’s brow furrowed, “I’d ask why, but with the way you’ve been describing him, Nighteye sounds like a real hardass.”

Chiyo couldn’t help but chuckle, “Oh, that doesn’t even begin to cover it with him. But, he was always suspicious of her. She was brought into the group on a whim, without Toshinori consulting either Torino or Mirai. And, once learning about his powers, Kaina was adamant on not letting Mirai look into her future, despite the fact that he never asked to in the first place. I suppose we now know why. Because of that, Mirai was the one who convinced All Might to keep Kaina in the dark about One For All and the true target of their mission. Outside of that, those two just seemed to clash on the regular. My guess is they both were fiending for Toshinori’s attention, and Kaina always won in that regard. I do have to ask, though. What does Toshinori hope to gain here? As much as I hate to say it, what Kaina did was cut and dried.”

The couple shared a glance, with Izuku asking, “Didn’t you ever wonder why she did it?”

“Of course I did. We all did, but there was no answer I was happy with or could believe, and she refused any visitors.”

“...I don’t think you’ll be happy with this answer either.”

**(** **Tokyo: HPSC Headquarters** **)**

  
  

“Isn’t it a little early for wi-...” Hawks sat in one of the chairs across from Madam President’s desk, cutting his sentence short as she glared at him, continuing to pour. He had just finished summarizing what happened in Musutafu, and he honestly couldn’t tell if she was taking it better or worse than he was expecting. “...I guess it’s five o’clock somewhere.”

“Why didn’t you stop him from taking the files?”

Hawks looked up from the floor, cheek resting in his hand, “What do you mean ‘stop him’? Couldn’t arrest him, he technically didn't do anything illegal. Not to mention sending me there like that was already shady, but All Might was listening in. Taking the files from him would also look bad. At least we know who’s working with All Might now.”

Madam President merely hummed in response, not having a proper counter-argument to anything Hawks said. She slowly paced behind her desk, the morning sun rising higher above the Tokyo skyline outside of her glass wall. 

“What exactly is All Might’s connection to Midoriya?” Madam President stared down at the floor, circling a glass of wine in her hand. “He’s been working overseas for years, they’ve never had any time to speak until a month ago. Midoriya’s a good worker, a loyal worker. He’s been with us for twenty-years…What happened?”

Hawks sighed, shrugging, “It’s like you said, from an outside perspective it might just seem like we had a crazy assassin in our midst. He’s just doing what he thinks is right, and not to mention nobody’s gonna reject helping All Might. I wouldn’t be too hard on the guy. Doesn’t help that I showed up looking suspicious as shit. Now he probably thinks I’m an assassin…”

She turned to him, brow raised, “You are an assassin.”

“Ah, c’mon. I think of myself as more of an enforcer,” Hawks smirked. “We don’t run things like it was with Nagant.”

“...No, we don’t.” She turned back to the window, leaning against her desk. “However, if we can’t handle this soon, some measures might have to be taken.”

Hawks peered at her, sitting up in his chair, “Ma’am, with all due respect, this isn’t the same as other assignments. This isn’t some villain or terrorist, it’s a civilian. From his perspective, he’s just doing his job.”

“Doing his job could jeopardize our society as we know it.”

“We could just explain that to him. He’s worked for us for twenty-years, he’s gotta understand more than anybody that some ways the world works aren’t pretty.”

“Takami,” Madam President glared at him over her shoulder, her voice low. “I need you to think clearly here. You know what’s at stake, and you know that we’re here to make the difficult decisions that no one else is willing to make. One life, or the safety of all of Japan.”

Hawks closed his eyes, sighing as he stood up from his chair. He knew the stakes, he had been reminded a hundred times. This just felt so…wrong. “Let me try and smooth him out first, alright?”

“Of course. Take whatever measure you feel necessary if it means not resorting to violence. Keep your comms open, I’ll be listening when I can.”

Hawks turned around, frowning as he took his leave,  “...Yes, ma’am.”

**(** **Heights Alliance: Katsuki’s Room** **)**

  
  

*\*Knock-Knock\**

Katsuki didn’t move from his bed, continuing to stare-up at the ceiling. He kept his lights off, hoping that might make people think he was still asleep. Really just Kirishima. He was the only one he was expecting to show up.

Unfortunately, it was much worse.

*“Katsuki Fucking Bakugou, open this door right God-damn now.”*

Katsuki groaned quietly, still not getting up. He shouldn’t be surprised, Aizawa said parents would be called. 

*“Three…”*

“...”

*“Two…”*

Katsuki sighed as he got up, knowing full well that his mother would kick the door off its hinges if he didn’t open it. He opened his door, greeted by the glare of his mother. He looked down the hall, seeing Kirishima and Kaminari peeking out from his dorm, quickly hiding again once they had been caught. “...Let’s get this over wit-AH!” 

Katsuki was yanked down by his ear and dragged into the room, his mother kicking the door shut behind them. She grabbed him by the face, taking deep breaths as she examined his face for injuries. 

He turned his head away, moving back towards his bed, “I’m fine.”

“Clearly not. Something has to be severely wrong with your brain. You tried to beat-up Little Midoriya’s girlfriend? What the fuck is wrong with you?!”

“I *fought* her. She can handle herself…”

Mitsuki blinked a couple times, eyebrows raising up, “Holy shit, nevermind. I’ve got it all wrong… *She* beat the fuck outta *you.”*

“Wh-?! What?! I didn’t fucking say that!”

“Katsuki, never in your entire life have you downgraded your abilities and raised someone else's. She kicked your ass.”

“Wh-?! Jus-?! No one won! We never finished the fight!” 

“You, Katsuki Bakugou, didn’t finish a fight? You’re just digging this hole even deeper.”

“Oh my-!” Katsuki ran his hand down his face, deciding to not even respond, knowing it would just make it worse.

“What the hell made you think that was a good idea? I’m not perfect, but I sure as shit raised you better than to fight someone’s girlfriend just to get at them.”

“I didn’t want to fight her!” Katsuki quickly tried to counter. “I asked Midoriya to be there, she showed up instead. We argued, and things went poorly. I didn-”

“Didn’t wanna fight her, I heard ya. Answer me this, though. Who hit first?”

“...”

“That’s what I thought. Are you that sick in the head? Haven’t you put that poor boy through enough?”

“I did-...” Katsuki faltered, his brow furrowing as he looked back up at his mother. “What?”

“I said-”

“I know what you fucking said. You *knew?”*

“Katsuki, who else would’ve beat him up?” Katsuki sat in disbelief, not sure if he was more surprised or pissed that she knew for all those years. “I knew you were at the playground that day.”

…Or, she knew far less than he thought.

“Oh, that.”

“Yes, that. I-...Wait, what did you think I was talking about?”

Katsuki kept his mouth shut, turning to look out the balcony, “Nothing.”

Mitsuki eyed him suspiciously, but decided to continue on. “I couldn’t look Inko in the eye after that. Neither of you ever admitted to it, but we knew. Midoriya was the sweetest, most innocent little boy in the world, and I raised the kid who decided to beat the snot outta him for no good reason.”

“You still punished me for it, so what’s it matter now?”

“It matters now because *you never learn!”* Mitsuki growled at him. “Now, I’m gonna have to apologize to two sets of parents now. At least, I would. Except I was told not to speak to either the Midoriyas or the Jirous for the time being. I can’t even apologize for you. You know, it was the strangest feeling. I was screamin’ and cheering for you to win the Sports Festival, and yet at the same time, I was truly hoping Midoriya would win. I thought it would do you some good, finally losing for once in your life. It was a little late, but I guess I got my wish.”

Katsuki sighed as his thumb and forefinger rubbed at his eyes, “So happy that it’s public knowledge that he beat the fuck outta me.”

“What else were you expecting? You hit his girlfriend. I know love seems to be a lost concept to you, so let’s just say you’re lucky to be alive. I hate to say it, but you deserved it. There’s no excuse for that. The kidnapping, failing your test, none of it. I still remember how bad your fight at the festival got. You two were wailing on each other, it was brutal. Now, you tried to drag him out to fight, because you just can’t take the idea of him doing better than you? Speaking of which, would you care to explain why you failed to get your license? I think I can make a pretty good guess.”

“Cause I’m a fucking asshole,” Katsuki shrugged.

“Exac-...” Mitsuki stopped, peering at her son. “Did you just call *yourself* an asshole?”

“Yes, can we just get to the part where you punish me or something?”

Katsuki waited for her to continue, but it was just silence. He looked back up to his mother as she continued to stare at him quizzically, “...What brought this on? What have you done, Katsuki?” 

“Fuck are you talking about?”

“You’re different…Something’s happened. Knowing you, you’re the one responsible.”

“I was just-”

“In a fight? So? You’ve been in those before. Didn’t get your license? You could just take the test again, except you fucked the chances of that by getting into a fight…Why did you wanna fight him? Why Midoriya? Why would you go this far, risk so much, just to fight him?”

“...”

Mitsuki sat down on the bed next to him, reaching up and gently holding his cheek to guide his gaze towards hers. “Is there anything you wanna tell me?”

Katsuki just stared back, still not used to this side of his mother. She had been like this since Kamino, and before that he hadn’t seen her like that since he was little. He was sure most in his situation would consider it a blessing, but ironically he wanted nothing more than for her to just go back to her ways of screaming at him. 

It was so much simpler that way. Now everything was just…complicated.

He fucking despised complicated.

“...No.”

Mitsuki just stared back as Katsuki turned to look away to stare at nothing, opening her mouth to say something, but nothing came out. She just sighed, standing up from the bed and moving towards the door. 

“Despite everything, I wanted nothing more than for you to come to this school. I wanted you to learn. I thought this place could fix my mistakes, show you the potential I know you have. But, maybe I let you go too far. Maybe I shouldn’t have let you come back after Kamino…Maybe you don’t belong here.” 

Katsuki’s gaze shot back up at his mother, feeling like he had been gut punched. Kyouka’s words from the night prior echoed through his mind. 

Mitsuki reached the door, hand on the handle. “Katsuki, I’ll always do everything I can for you, but there’s only so much that can be done if you refuse to help yourself. I haven’t lost faith in you, kid. I just can’t scream and smack you, it clearly doesn’t work. I’m not even mad, because I know you’re doing all this ‘cause you’re hurtin’ inside. For the first time, I’m…I’m disappointed in you. And, I…I’m sorry.”

She left the room, leaving Katsuki in darkness once again, the only light streaming in from the balcony door. 

…Sorry?

**(** **Some Time Later: UA Faculty Office** **)**

  
  

“I’ll be totally honest with you, I don’t really know what I’m looking at.” Toshinori swiveled around in his chair as he looked at Hisashi, who was sitting at the desk next to him. 

They had cleared the desks, sliding the computers and keyboards back to layout all of the files that they had copied from the HPSC records. Thankfully it was the weekend, so it was just them. The last thing they needed was anyone else asking questions. 

“Look at the dates of the transactions I highlighted,” Hisashi replied without looking up from his own papers, readjusting his glasses. “Can you think of any specific points in time when Nagant went out of town?”

“Jesus, we started working together almost twenty-years ago. I don’t know if I can remember that.”

“Vague is better than nothing at all. Did you two text?”

“Quite a bit, yeah.”

“Did she ever tell you when she was gonna be gone for a couple days?”

“I…Huh. You know, probably. It’ll take me some time to go back through all of those messages.”

“That’s fine, trust me. Even if we get this whole thing legitimized, there’s no telling how long it would take to actually reach court. Especially since the HPSC will probably be temporarily shut down for investigation. If you can think of any dates —or even general points in time— then we can check missing persons reports, unsolved murders, or murders by gunshot from around that time. It’s nothing concrete, but if we can ever get Nagant to testify to them, then it…” Hisashi stopped, leaning back in his chair as he saw Toshinori’s worried expression as he continued to gaze down at the papers. “...You don’t seem to like this idea.”

“Hm?” Toshinori was pulled from his mind, shaking his head. “No, I…It’s a good idea, it’s just…My main goal for all of this was to get Kaina out of jail. But, if she admits to multiple murders, then…”

Hisashi pursed his lips, wringing his hands together, “Maybe we can cut a deal. We already have the means to call for a mistrial and overturn her life-sentencing. If we can get to Nagant, work with her, then after all this we can charge the HPSC board for entrapment. If you truly believe she would never murder someone unless tricked, blackmailed, or coerced, then I think there’s a real shot of getting her out of all this. Not squeaky clean, mind you. But, I think there’s a shot.”

“...What about the murder of the chairman?”

Hisashi clicked his tongue, shaking his head, “Yeah, I got nothing for that one. *Maybe* defense of a third person. As in, she killed him to stop the murders of other people. But, that’s one hell of an argument to make, especially since she was the one carrying out the murders in the first place. But, All Might, think of it this way. Defending Nagant for killing one evil person is a lot better than defending her for the murders of many. We have a solid foundation to solve the latter problem, which is a whole lot better than nothing.”

Toshinori dragged his hands down his face, nodding his head, “You’re right. Thank you. I’m sorry, it’s just-”

“I get it,” Hisashi put his hand up, stopping Toshinori. “I’ll do everything I can, I promise.”

Scoffing, Toshinori shook his head as he leaned against the desk, “You’ve already done more than enough. Truly, I couldn’t have gotten any of this without you. I was going nowhere until you came along.”

“A-Ah, well…Like I said, I get to be a hero. For a bit, at least. It’s about time I did something right. Spent all these years away from my family, all for corruption…”

“Hey, don’t do that. Just because one part of something is bad, doesn’t mean the rest of it is. Don’t let this invalidate all the good work you’ve done.”

Hisashi sighed, but nodded his head. “You’re right…But, I’ll stop beating myself up when the job is done.”

“...Jesus, you really are Young Midoriya’s father.”

“Hmhmhm, thank you. I’m not sure if he gets it from me, or if I get it from him. Alright, let’s get everything here copied at least four or five times.” Hisashi got up and walked over to the large printer near the window. After turning on and checking the screen, he looked back at All Might. “Low on ink. Where do you keep your cartridges?”

Toshinori set down the papers he had in hand, getting up from his desk, “Don’t worry, I’ve got it.”

Hisashi nodded as he moved back to the desk and began gathering everything up. Toshinori weaved through the tables, making his way to the supply closet in the corner. “Now that they know what we’re doing, we’re gonna need to make a ton of copies of everything we’ve got. We’ll keep our own copies, we’ll store some elsewhere, and then if you want we can give some to confidants. Do you have anyone you can trust to hold on to some confidential documents like this?”

“Yeah, I-” Toshinori opened the closet door, freezing as he found the closet wasn’t empty. Midnight was carrying Mt. Lady and holding her against the shelf. They both looked like deer caught in headlights. 

Spending what was closing-in on a year around love-drunk knuckleheads, Toshinori didn’t even flinch as he reached over and grabbed an ink cartridge and closed the door. 

“Yeah, I’ve got a few people. I have a detective friend, Tsukauchi. He’s helped me a lot over the years. Then, there's my old mentor. He’d die before giving away any kind of secret…Unless it’s an embarrassing story about me. I’ll probably get copies for Nezu or Aizawa, too.”

“The principle? Nezu does have some influence. You think he could help?”

“Money,” Toshinori answered immediately. “I can easily pay for any legal expenses, but we’re talking about an infinite bank account here.”

“Fair point,” Hisashi nodded as he took the ink cartridge and began to replace the old one. “Hey, by any chance do you have connections in Tartarus?”

“Me? No, but my detective friend I mentioned does. Why?”

Hisashi tossed the empty ink cartridge in the trash can next to the printer, grabbing the papers from the desk, “I want to see if I can find the guards assigned to Nagant on their daily schedule. Maybe they can enlighten us on her time in prison.”

“Wouldn’t they be some of the first you’d expect to be in on the whole thing?”

Hisashi hummed, shaking his head, “I doubt it. This is something the HPSC would want to keep as close to the chest as possible.”

“Hm, still. After today, I don’t want you going to talk to them alone. We’ll go next weekend when we’re both free.” Hisashi nodded as Toshinori turned around and looked up at the clock. “Damn it, I’ve gotta go. I have to oversee a detention today.”

“Mm, one of Izuku’s classmates?”

“...Technically.”

**(****Afternoon: Ground Beta**)

  
  

Izuku and Kyouka stood amongst last night’s destruction in their workout clothes, watching the construction bots do their thing and fix it all like nothing happened. 

Kyouka clicked her tongue as she played with the zipper of her sweat jacket, “Starting to fully appreciate the UA infinite credit card right about now.”

“Ah, we wouldn’t have to pay for it anyway. It’s a hero school. We’re not responsible for destruction of property as long as it's in specific training locations.”

“Yeah, well don’t tell that to Aizawa. He’s still mad we’re basically getting away with this.”

“How do you know?”

“I can hear him. He just drove through the gates in one of the golf carts. He’s grumbling under his breath.”

Izuku closed his eyes, shaking his head, “Your powers are so cool.”

Kyouka chuckled, leaning against Izuku as they continued to watch the bots relay concrete into the ground. “Hey, about earlier? Don’t you worry about Nighteye. He was probably hesitant because he doesn’t know you.”

“Yeah, but Gran Torino reached out to meet me, and we both know how, uh… *grumpy* he can be. Nighteye didn’t even send a request for an internship, and we both know I would’ve freaked out the moment I saw it, so we know it wasn’t there. Then, there’s explaining you. Maybe it’s just better to wait until he wants to see me.”

“We both know that’s not how you operate. You’ll just sit and think about it.”

Izuku sighed, “Yeah, I know. But, he and All Might apparently aren’t speaking either, and Recovery Girl said I wasn’t the sole reason. Maybe he doesn’t want to be involved with all this anymore, and I can’t blame him if that’s the case. We’ve got time before the Work Studies are even open for application. Let’s just think about it for now.”

“Okay. But, hey, if he really hates you, I can just fight him for you.”

“...I know you’re joking, but given your recent track record, I also believe you would.”

Kyouka smiled up at him, “I just love you so much that the thought of someone hating you makes me furious.”

“Hmhmhm, thanks,” Izuku chuckled, kissing the top of her head.

“No lovey-dovey during detention,” Aizawa's voice suddenly appeared behind them as he rolled up in one of UA’s cart, All Might in the passenger seat. He stepped out of the car, walking over to the Problem Children. “Detention begins now. If you two like to fight so much, then I’ll give you what you want.” 

Izuku instantly raised his hand up, “I take issue with hitting my girlfriend.”

“Not fight each other,” Aizawa sighed. “However, in the future, she will need practice with someone more her speed. If you won’t even do light sparring, you’ll make a fine punching bag.”

Izuku just deadpanned, “I’m used to it.”

“Whenever the shit hits the fan, Jirou won’t be able to hide her powers. The unfortunate aspect about all of this, is that our little secret isn’t going to last forever. If someone of All For One’s power shows up, we’ll need you both. That means we need to work on you two acting as one. Your performance at the License Exams was good, but you two have never fought with both of you using your quirk.” Aizawa walked over to the car, grabbing a tablet from the passenger seat. “With your speed and power, the two of you should be able to apply a nearly unstoppable amount of pressure on any opponent. They shouldn’t be able to breathe with you two attacking them. Before Kamino, I would’ve suggested All Might as your sparring partner. Obviously we can’t do that anymore. Instead, we’ll have to throw cannon fodder at you.”

Aizawa tapped his tablet, and Kyouka could hear the creak of sliding metal and the beeping of motherboards powering to life in the distance. “We’re allowed to fight the bots? Don’t you need them?”

“We can always make more,” Aizawa shrugged. “Money’s never been a factor here. Now, I’ve routed the bots path to move in groups in different parts of the city. We’ll be watching through the cameras, critiquing as you go along. Don’t just start fighting bots individually. The whole point is fighting seamlessly, as if you were in each others’ minds.”

*“Androids 17 and 18…”* Izuku whispered to himself, to which Kyouka both rolled her eyes and couldn’t help but smile.

“This will also be a lesson in movement for you, Young Jirou,” All Might added in. “You haven’t been given any good chances to practice your mobility, only speeding yourself up in short bursts. You’ll need to get used to the fact that you’re not just faster, you’re stronger. Which in turn means that you can move yourself in ways you couldn’t. Jumping up and off of walls, running right through objects as if they weren’t even there, picking up large objects and using them, even picking up and moving your opponents. Your senses are boosted to compensate, but it’ll still be a bit of a shock to your system for the first few times. Young Izuku, be sure to share your guidance as well.”

Izuku nodded, “Yes, sir.”

“Aw, someone’s been reading ‘Teaching for Dummies’ again,” Kyouka smiled at Toshinori.

“Hey!” Toshinori reached into his breast pocket, pulling out the book and waving it in her face, “It’s a good read!”

“Put these in your ears,” Aizawa reached into his pocket and pulled out little, black communicators. “We’ll critique with these. Now, get outta my face.”

Kyouka pursed her lips as she watched Aizawa turn around and walk back towards the cart, turning to All Might, “Do you think he’ll ever get over it?”

“Cut him some slack,” Toshinori replied, crossing his arms. “It’s been non-stop since camp, and we’re a trio that comes with more baggage than an airport. In all honesty, he’s taking everything far better than expected.”

“I’m not hearing the sounds of robots hitting students!” Aizawa yelled from the cart, staring blankly at his tablet as he drank his coffee.

“...Don’t you mean students hitting ro-?”

“I know what I said,” Aizawa deadpanned, not even looking up at them.

Izuku turned back to All Might with concern, “He won’t release the Zero-Pointer, right?”

“...” All Might sucked in through his teeth, slowly turning around to walk away. “Welp, good luck!”

“Wh-?” Izuku couldn’t even reply as Toshinori had already left them to their devices. He sighed, turning to Kyouka and handing her an earpiece, “ Okay, first of all, don’t be afraid to push your percentages a little higher than what you’re comfortable with. It’ll hurt a little, but your body has to get used to One For All so you can use higher percentages. It’s partially about staying in shape, sure. But, for the most part, One For All just has to take its time and be stress tested…Well, stress tested without breaking your bones. Have you ever broken a bone before?”

“No,” Kyouka shook her head, putting her communicator in. “Is it as bad as people say?”

“U-Uh…Let’s just avoid breaking anything.”

“I like that plan,” Kyouka nodded with a shaky breath. “Okay…Okay…”

Izuku watched as Kyouka began to bounce on her feet, shaking our her arms as sparks of violet began to dance around her body. It had been about a month and some change since OFA had attached itself to Kyouka. They had kept her on very low percentages, just to be safe. Outside of testing the passive boost to her jacks, that is. Things had been way too hectic for them to be pushing her limits. The last thing they needed was for her to be out of commission for the License Exams.

She had been training with him since the start of the year, and while Kyouka wasn’t jacked by any means, she was definitely in shape. There was also the fact that this bond apparently allowed OFA’s physical backlash to be dampened, even if just a bit. The second user could be used as sort of an energy sponge, rather than have it recoiled back at the one attacking.

It definitely wasn’t perfect though, saying that Izuku already broke his other arm against Muscular, and that was after the split took place. He hadn’t stress tested his own output now, but he could tell his typical fifteen-percent was far more comfortable than it was before.

At camp, that percentage was a real struggle. 

The point of all this being, Kyouka could probably handle slightly higher percentages than he could this early on. But, *probably* not by much.

“Let’s see how you handle past five-percent. Try seven or eight, maybe?” Kyouka just nodded in response, raising her output ever so slightly. Izuku faintly felt her pulling on One For All from his body. “Okay, how’s that?”

“Mm, I wouldn’t call it comfortable, but it’s not bad. It’s almost like my muscles are all tensing up, even when they’re not.”

“If you can move, that’s what matters. I’ll do my best to teach you how I tend to move, and how Gran Torino moves. But, for now let’s just stick with running.” Izuku crouched down, beginning to stretch his legs as his own cyan sparks crackled against his skin. “Ready?”

“Always ready with you, Pretty Boy-”

*“No romantic banter!”* Aizawa suddenly came through from their ear pieces. *“With the ear pieces I can’t avoid it.”*

Kyouka deadpanned, looking at Izuku, “You know, we got All Might that date with Pixie Bob. You think we can do the same for Aizawa? Might calm him down, or make him…you know, happy?”

*“I can still hear you.”*

“Hey, you love cats too, right Aizawa? Mandalay’s single.”

*“If you don’t start right now, I’m gonna start this cart and run you both over.”*

“...Yeah, he’s probably not bluffing.” 

With that, the couple took off in two bolts of purple and green light, racing their way through the city streets to find the first group of bots. 

Back in the cart, Aizawa placed his tablet on the magnet attached to the console and opened up the camera feeds. He and Toshinori could see two streaks of cyan and purple race across the screen through different parts of the city. “Everyone still hear me?”

*“Yep.” / “Yeah.”* Kyouka and Izuku responded respectively, making it the first group of bots. 

“Good. Now, you can all catch me up on this Lady Nagat situation that I’ve been dragged into. I looked up her name, and most of her information was redacted. Everything except for the fact that she murdered the HPSC chairman. I knew her name seemed familiar.”                     

“It’s more complicated than that,” Toshinori quickly added. "But, she and I, uh...worked together, for about ten years or so."

Shouta squinted at his coworker, before rubbing his eyes with an aggravated sigh, "You were dating a murderer."

"What?! First off, this whole thing is pointing towards Kaina being forced or tricked by the HPSC into being an assassin! And, second, we *never* dated!"

*"He wanted to, though,"* Kyouka chuckled through the ear piece. 

"Not helping!" All Might yelled. 

Izuku grabbed one of the bots by the arm, throwing it over at Kyouka for her to finish off, blowing a raspberry, *"...E-Eh, long story short I went through All Might’s memories a while back and...Yeah, he really did."*

"Stop it!" Toshinori cried out. “We never dated!”

*“You basically dated without actual dates.”*

Toshinori ran his hand down his face, ignoring Aizawa trying to hide his smirk behind his coffee. “Look, Kaina may or may not have been an assassin for the HPSC.”

“...Mhm.”

“...That’s it?”

“I just assumed pretty much every government has assassins,” Aizawa shrugged. “I do have to ask, though. If she was an assassin, what exactly do you hope to do with all this? She would be guilty.”

“I don’t think it’s that simple. The Kaina I know would never kill people for the HPSC’s political agenda. She was suffering, she hated it. Maybe she was tricked or blackmailed, just *something* . Something must’ve gone down, because she and the HPSC clearly didn’t like each other.”

“Giving the Chairman’s office a red Jackson Pollock paintjob would make anyone think that.”

“It’s not just that. There were these times where she was clearly unhappy, but I was so focused on finding All For One that by the time I got around to her, she was moved on from it. Or, I guess she learned to cover it up better. So, I figured it was just a fleeting thing, everyone has their days.”

Over the call, Izuku asked, *“Did you find anything from the ‘Detective Work’ you went on?”*

“Yeah, actually. Your father pulled everything the HPSC had on Kaina. Which, to be fair, wasn’t a lot. They really did their very best to bury her. However, we pulled some financial information and dates that might help, along with shady dealings around her incarceration. B-But, uh…There was a bit of a problem. I think we came face-to-face with Kaina’s replacement.”

Izuku stopped fighting, eyes widening, *“An assassin came after my dad?”*

*“Babe, look ou-!”* Kyouka’s warning was fruitless as a bot smacked Izuku across the face, sending him straight into a nearby restaurant.

Toshinori hissed through his teeth as he watched dust plume out of the broken restaurant wall, “U-Uh…kinda. It unfortunately gets a lot worse…”

“Of course it does,” Aizawa sighed. “Worse how?”

“Now, to be fair, I technically can’t say with one-hundred percent certainty that it’s him, but…It’s Hawks.”

The couple was silent over the call, trying and failing to process that information. Aizawa’s gaze shot towards Toshinori, eyes wide and brows knit together, “...Excuse me?”

“I know, but it’s true. He appeared out of nowhere before the Records Office was even open, started asking questions, and already knew Mr. Midoriya’s name. If he’s not an assassin, he was at bare minimum sent there under the orders of the HPSC.”

*“But, Hawks is Number Two, right?”* Kyouka asked. *“Do you think they manipulated his ratings to put him at the top? Make him seem more trustworthy?”*

On the screen, Izuku suddenly shot out through the smoke in a bolt of light, slamming right through the bot that hit him. He brushed himself off, rubbing at his chin as he was sent into his typical mental deep-dive, *“I doubt it. Hawks has always had one of the best records out of everybody. His hero work has always been among the best. However, Lady Nagant was an underground hero. Maybe they told him to stay in the spotlight to seem less suspicious, hide in plain sight.”*

*“It definitely worked. He would probably be low on the list if you asked me to think of potential suspects.”*

*“There’s also the possibility that they want an All Might under their thumb. Someone of All Might’s popularity and influence, or at least as much as they can get, but one they can control. This entire conversation is exactly why they would prefer to have control over people.”*

“Well, they basically have control over me now,” Toshinori shrugged, rubbing at his temple. “The literal second this investigation gets off the ground, and our cover is already blown.”

“So is theirs,” Aizawa countered. “You know Hawks is their agent.”

“Yeah, with no proof.”

“Maybe, but you’re you. I know you’re not one to pull the popularity card, but it’s your word against theirs.”

Toshinori scoffed, resting his arm back over the seat, “You really think everyone will believe me over the government?”

Aizawa just deadpanned at him, and the couple both turned towards the camera to give him the same expression. “Yes.” / *“Yes.”*

“...Ok, fair enough. But, that just leaves us at a stalemate if both of us are too afraid to make moves against each other. If I keep investigating right in their faces, it might make them desperate and they’ll become unpredictable. The most dangerous animal is a cornered one.”

*“Do you trust her?”* 

Toshinori’s brows knit together at Kyouka’s question, “What?”

*“Do you trust her?”* Kyouka asked again, grunting as she used her jacks to crush the neck of one of the 1-Bots. *“Clearly she has something in mind, she wouldn’t be doing all this if she didn’t. But, I’d make a wild guess and say she doesn't have the ability to get the evidence you did. Whatever she does, she’s still gonna need you. If the HPSC has had assassins for who knows how long, then they’re masters at cover-ups. You’ll need whatever you can get your hands on before they get to it first.”*

“That…is a fair point.”

*“Eh, having a smart boyfriend tends to help.”*

“Not smart enough to avoid a fight,” Aizawa cut in. “Back to work.”

Both students grumbled, zipping off to find the next batch of robots to face. Toshinori slumped back into his seat, doing his very best to keep his full attention on his proteges and their performance. Yet, every so often, he just couldn’t help but glance up at the rooftops above.

He wasn’t sure which assassin he was looking for.

**(** **Heights Alliance: Kitchen** **)**

  
  

Katsuki felt like he had been staring into the fridge for an hour. He needed to eat, but just couldn’t find an ounce of hunger in him. 

He shut the door, dragging his hand down his face as he leaned back against the kitchen island. 

“...You know, I figured it was ‘unmanly’ to hide.”

From around the corner of the entrance, Kirishima slid around the corner, his shoulder pressed against the wall. “Figured it was better than getting an explosion in the face.”

“I-...What do you want? Can’t you avoid me like the plague? Everyone else has been?”

“Cause nobody wants to talk to a Bakugou that lost a fight.”

“Didn’t lose.”

“Against who? Cause that’s another part of it. I don’t think people are too happy with you fighting Jirou.”

“Then you’re even bigger idiots than I thought if you think she can’t handle herself.”

“...”

Katsuki waited for a response, turning around when he was met with silence, finding Kirishima staring at him with wide eyes. “What?...Oh for fuck’s sake, she didn’t kick my-”

“Bro, she totally kicked your ass.”

“We never finished the fig-...” Katsuki stopped himself, remembering how this conversation went with his mother, opting to just stop himself. “What the fuck do you want, man?”

“To know what happened. To know what’s wrong with you. I get you three have been at each other’s throats forever now…Well, more like you and Jirou. You’ve had it out for Midoriya since day one, and I still don’t know why.”

“Why?” Katsuki sighed. “Why is this so important?”

“Because I care about my friends, despite how much they act like assholes,” Kirishima shrugged as rested his hands on the other side of the island. “Midoriya has Jirou, and…Well, you don’t have anybody to help you.”

“Don’t need help.”

“Bakugou, in the time that I’ve known you, all you’ve ever needed was help.”

“I can help myself,” Katsuki grunted as he began to walk out of the kitchen. “None of it is any of your business anyway.”

“Maybe not, but I wanna help all the same,” Kirishima followed him, heading down the hall towards the common area. “

“You’re not getting shit from me. You wanna know so bad, go ask the other two, but I promise you that they’re not gonna say anything either.”

They reached the common area, now standing in front of the main staircase, “You sure? Jirou hates your guts, she might take any chance to make someone else hate you.”

That…was actually a good point. But, Midoriya would stop her, for whatever reason. “Midoriya and her can do whatever they want. I don’t care. They can hate me, you can hate me, it doesn’t matter.”

“...Did you just call him Midoriya?”

“Oh for the love of-!”

“Excuse me?” Both students turned their heads, surprised by the sudden appearance of a woman next to them. Katsuki furrowed his brow, recognizing her as the vine girl from earlier, standing with a bag strapped to her shoulder and her hands loosely clasped together at her waist. “Katsuki Bakugou?”

He and Kirishima glanced at each other before responding, “...Yeah?”

“You seemed troubled earlier. You never answered my question.”

“Yeah, and? Look, I don’t know you, lady. Just leave me alone.”

“But, what’s the matter?”

  
“None of your fuckin’ business. Why the hell do you care?”

“I go to a hero school, don’t I? I sensed you’ve been troubled since I saw you at the Sports Festival. Now it seems different, however. Many find it easier to confess to someone they don’t know. I’m no judge, that’s not my place. However, I believe that those who have judged themselves can find themselves trapped in their own sentencing.”

Katsuki stood there, completely stunned. What was it with green-haired people and trying to help him? “Look, can everyone just fuck off. I don’t need anyone’s help, especially from crazy frea-”

“I’m not crazy,” Shiozaki cut him off, her voice suddenly very stern. “I only want to spread kindness, especially to someone notorious for spreading hate and drowning desperately in the sin of pride to the point to where he cannot escape the suffocating chokehold of his ego to see he is in pain.”

Kirishima’s eyes widened, sucking in his lips and holding his breath as her voice practically echoed across the entire building. He needed to get Katsuki out of here before he made things even worse for himself. 

Shiozaki sighed, shaking her head, “Please, forgive me. I shouldn’t have said that. I-”

“What makes you think you can help me?” Kirishima was hit with a double-whammy after Katsuki’s question, not sure what he was witnessing. He was so prepared to use his quirk just to get Katsuki up the steps. Nobody spoke to him that way except for Jirou.

Shiozaki shrugged, “I can’t say for sure until I know the issues that plague you. But, I do know that denying yourself help will get you nowhere. What’s the point of feeling pain if you cannot learn from it?”

“I’m not in pain.”

“What’s the point of lying to yourself when you already know the truth?”

“...You’re fucking relentless, you know that?”

“I prefer persistent, it’s more in line with how I would describe my faith.”

Katsuki peered at her, “Faith in what?”

“In many things. But, I don’t think my faith and what helps me through pain would interest you that much. I do, however, have faith in people.”

Katsuki was silent for a while, stewing on it all. Everything in his body was telling him how much he hated this. He kept thinking about telling her to fuck off, go back to brooding in his room. 

But, if there was anything that Kastuki had learned from the past twenty-four hours, it was to probably stop listening to his initial instincts. 

“I can see that accepting help is still a struggle for you. So, I will simply give you this, and let you decide for yourself.” Shiozaki reached into her bag, pulling out one of the flyers that she was holding back when she first saw Katsuki on the bench. 

Katsuki took the paper, brow furrowing as he read it, “Bible Study? I’m not religious.”

“I didn’t think you were. You can come after it next Sunday, but you’re obviously welcome to sit in if you wish. And you, as well.” She handed another flyer to Kirishima, then bowed to them both. “I hope you have a blessed day.” 

She turned around and walked away, leaving the boys just as stunned as when she arrived. 

Kirishima turned to Katsuki,mouth agape, “Dude…What the hell was that?”

Katsuki looked down at the paper again, rejecting his initial instinct to crumple it up and toss it, “...No fucking clue.”

  
  
  
  

***~...AMP…~***

  
  
  

**(** **Evening: UA Teacher’s Housing** )

  
  

Toshinori sat back on his couch, looking down at the papers spread out across his coffee table. He had spent the last three hours since Izuku and Kyouka’s training searching through all of his old texts with Kaina. 

It was…surprisingly nice to look back on.

He opted to sleep at his house at UA, just to get started early. It was a nice place, but Nezu wouldn’t accept anything less for his staff. Blue-gray walls, a decent little living room, TV, sizable kitchen, a nice bedroom and bathroom upstairs. Nothing too big or fancy, but it was cozy. And, despite his coworkers being his neighbors (those who chose to stay on campus for the school year) it felt isolated. 

After Kamino, he had come home to his front lawn absolutely covered with flowers, all from his neighbors after realizing who he was. It was actually very nice. None of them had walked up to him or tried to pry. They simply let him live in peace.

*\*Knock-Knock-Knock\**

Toshinori perked up, looking to the left towards his front door. He reached for his papers, about to stack them up when…

*“I swear if you’re not in there, Toshinori…”*

…Oh, crap.

*“Shit, shit shit…”* Toshinori bolted off of the couch, running to the door, swinging it open to the clearly unhappy Ryuko.

“Where *the hell* have you been?”

“I’m so, *so* sorry.”

“Your phone better be broken, or you’ve got a lot of explaining to do.”

“...”

“...You’ve got a lot of explaining to do.”

“...Yeah.” Toshinori sighed as he stepped out of the way, letting her inside. 

As he shut the door, he looked back to see her sitting on the armrest of the couch, her arms crossed. “Radio silence is one thing, but radio silence the day after someone tried to kill you?”

“It’s been a long day; a very busy day. But, it’s no excuse. I had time to call back, but…My head’s been so cloudy.”

Ryuko’s brows raised, “About the assassination attempt?”

“...Technically.”

“What’s that supposed to mean? I-...Who’s this?” Ryuko’s eyes caught the papers on the table and reached down, picking up the paper with Kaina’s mugshot on it, her eyes widening. “Holy-! Toshi, this is her! This is the woman who shot at you!”

Toshinori sighed, already knowing where this conversation was probably gonna go, “... I know.”

“Who told you? Did they find her? And…Lady Nagant? Why does that sound so familiar?”

“No one told me. I-...I knew from the moment I saw the bullet.” Ryuko furrowed her brow, clearly still confused. Toshinori walked over to Ryuko, sitting down next to her. “That’s Kaina Tsutsumi. Former Pro Hero, greatest sniper to ever live…and my best friend.”

“...Your mysterious best friend that I didn’t even know existed tried to shoot you?”

“...She wasn’t trying to shoot me. She was trying to get my attention, tell me she had escaped prison.”

“Prison?”

“Tartarus. You did know she existed, you just forgot like the rest of the world. That’s what they wanted you to do.”

“Who’s they?”

Toshinori sighed, already knowing he was going to sound like he needed a tin-foil hat. “...The HPSC.”

Ryuko squinted at him, trying to find the right response. But, the mention of the HPSC suddenly made it click in her mind, her gaze returning to the picture. “Holy shit, wait a minute. She’s the one that shot the old Chairman.”

“That’d be her.” 

Toshinori got up from the couch, walking over to his briefcase that sat on the nearby black armchair. He pulled out a portfolio book he had pulled from the depths of his closet back home. After everything with Kaina started up again, he supposed he started feeling nostalgic. He flipped over to one of the first few pages, handing it to Ryuko. 

Ryuko took the book, looking down at all of the pictures. There were multiple with Toshi and Kaina, the main one being a larger photo of him, Nagant, Recovery Girl, a younger man she didn’t recognize, and an older man she didn’t recognize. They were all in front of Toshinori’s truck at the beach, what seemed like a shark-man villain tied up in the back. 

Kaina was sitting on top of the truck, both hands on Toshinori’s shoulders as they smiled at the camera. 

“I’m sorry for asking, but were you two…?”

“No, it never got that far. At that point in my life, I couldn’t afford relationships.”

“...But, if you could?” Ryuko asked, an emotion in her voice Toshinori couldn’t recognize. It wasn’t angry, it was almost like she already knew the answer.

“...Yes, I would’ve.”

“...Did you love her?”

Toshinori opened his mouth to answer, his body’s first instinct was to simply continue suppressing it all. He had done it for all the years he had worked with Kaina. He was so good at it by that point, he never even thought about the question. He supposed he had considered it far too dangerous of a question to ask, for different reasons at different times.

If he was asked during their time as a team, it was too dangerous, because he might not be able to help himself anymore if he was honest. 

If he was asked after she was arrested, it would just hurt so much more than it already did. 

He had hid enough from himself, and especially from Ryuko. She deserved the truth.

“...Yes.”

Ryuko took a moment before nodding her head. She handed the book back, resting her hands at her side, “Okay, so she broke out of Tartarus and tried to get your attention. How’d she even do that?”

“Well, I can’t say I know for sure, but…Probably the League of Villains.”

Her eyebrows went up, "And that doesn’t concern you?”

“Oh, it scares the shit outta me. But, I-...I have faith in her. I know that she would never do that unless she felt she had no other choice. She can’t take down the higher-ups at the HPSC with no resources.”

“You mentioned them before. Why does she hate them so much? Enough to murder the chairman, that is.”

Toshinori blew a raspberry as he tossed the portfolio onto the couch, “That’s an explanation and a half.”

Ryuko just shrugged, “Well, saying that I accidentally left my toothbrush here the other night, I’d say I can afford to stay a while.”

Toshinori chuckled dryly before pursing his lips, nodding as he sat back down. “...Alright then.”

  
  
  

***~...AMP…~***

  
  

**(** **Midoriya Family Apartment** **)**

  
  

Hisashi had his files spread out on his bed, holding his laptop and pacing back and forth as he combed through missing persons reports of Pros and political figures over the last ten years, seeing if any of them were made a couple days after any of the mysterious transactions made to Nagant’s account.

He had made sure every door and window was locked when he got home. He closed all of the blinds and checked every room, just in case. 

He had almost told Inko that it might be better to stay somewhere else for a few days, but he knew that was a fruitless effort. Inko wouldn’t move a damn muscle if he thought he was in danger.

Hisashi didn’t even actually think he was in danger. Flashing the All Might Shield of Immunity definitely got him out of any immediate problems, they wouldn’t dare poke All Might with a stick.

But, he was dealing with a powerful government. He just couldn’t be sure what kind of stunts they would pull.

*“U-Uh…Honey?”* 

Hisashi looked up as Inko’s voice came from the main room, “Yeah?”

*“...Come in here, please.”*

Brow furrowed, Hisashi set his laptop down and stepped into the hallway. “Honey, what-...?”

Directly across from Hisashi’s position in the hall, he could see the blinds had been opened on their balcony door. 

Hawks stood on the other side of the glass.

His phone was still on the bed, but Hawks was looking directly at him. Running for it would just make things worse. 

*“Hey, uh, I know the wings might lead you to believe otherwise…”* Hawks called out to him, tapping on the door again. *“But, I can see there’s glass in front of me. Can I come in?”*

Hisashi walked into the living room, putting his hand on Inko’s back as he moved past her, *“My phone’s on the bed. Text All Might.”* 

He made it to the balcony door, sliding open the glass. Hawks stepped inside, his wings rustling behind him. “Phew, thanks. I started to get worried one of the neighbors would look outside.“

“...’Course.” Hisashi didn’t even think it was worth putting up some sort of act. He showed up to his home, there was no point in it now.

“Mrs. Midoriya, I'm extremely sorry for showing up like this,” Hawks bowed far down to Inko, his wings folding up behind him. “My wings are unfortunately pretty noticeable. I figured it would be better for us both if I didn’t use the front door. I’ll be out of your hair in a minute, I promise. I just need a quick word with your husband. Strictly business, I assure you.” 

Inko cleared her throat, and played it surprisingly cool, “It’s just an honor to have you in our home. I wish my husband had told me you were coming, I would’ve prepared something. Would you like anything to drink?”

“Oh, thank you very much, but I’m good. I won’t be more than a minute; two at max.”

“Well, then I’ll leave you to discuss business. The government work always flew over my head…Oh, uh-”

“Don’t worry about it,” Hawks chuckled. “I’m used to the jokes.”

Inko chuckled back, walking towards the hallway. Hisashi motioned towards the couch, “Have a seat?”

“Yeah, sure.” They moved to the living room, with Hawks sitting down on the couch, his wings going over the back, and Hisashi sitting in the armchair. Hawks leaned forward, shoulder relaxed, “Alright, listen, I’m not gonna sit here and do the whole song and dance with you. At this point, it would just be insulting to your intelligence. You know, and I know. Can we agree to be open about that, at least?”

Hisashi pressed his tongue against his teeth as he listened, nodding his head, “Would certainly make the conversation a lot easier.”

“Pfft, preaching to the choir. But, anyway, I’m just here to keep things cool. I’ll let you duct tape my wings up if it’ll make you feel better, but it’ll definitely take me longer to get out of here. I know your wife is going back there to call someone, most likely All Might. That’s completely fine. I’m not here to hurt you, threaten you, any of that. I just wanna say my piece, and do my best to make sure everyone goes on happily. Trust me, the last thing I want is my boss up my ass.”

“Who would be?”

“C’mon now. You know I can’t say that, but you’re a smart guy. I promised your wife that I’d make this fast, and I meant it. So, I’ll cut to the chase. We have our dirty laundry, but what government doesn’t? Lady Nagant was a dark spot from our past, and all of that was on the old chairman that she, uh…you know. It was his idea, his shady dealings, everything. We don’t run things like that anymore. But, that doesn’t mean we want to shout it loud from the rooftops, right? People would panic if they knew what they used to be up to. Keeping all this shit locked up and forgotten would make everything continue running smoothly. And, look, I know she and All Might were close. I’m sure everything has been hitting him like a damn truck, and I’m sorry for that. If I could go back and stop her from taking the deal, I would. But, decisions were made, and they left all of us to pick up the pieces in the wake.”

Hisashi peered at him, analyzing every word he said. He had met a lot of liars over the years, he worked in both politics and criminal justice for crying out loud. He had learned to see through his fair share of bullshit. 

Hawks seemed oddly…genuine. 

“How exactly do you do things differently than when Ms. Tsutsumi was working for them.”

“Well, I-”

*—”Don’t answer that.”—*

Hawks stopped himself as Madam President’s commanding tone came through his earpiece. Why couldn’t he answer that? Being able to actually explain himself would make things go so much easier. 

“I can’t answer that,” Hawk’s course-corrected his reply. “It’s not my place, you know how close to the chest the HPSC is. Secret operations are secret for a reason.”

“But, if what you’re doing isn’t so innocent, what’s the problem?”

“Never said innocent.”

“But, you want to just get away with it, right?”

“That’s a little extreme, man.”

“Not you. When Lady Nagant was around, you were just a little boy. All Might said he first saw you in an HPSC building as just a kid. It’s almost hard to blame you, you’re probably brainwashed…What does Madam President think?”

“...”

*—“Wrap it up. Come back to my office.”—*

He could hear the line go dead, leaving Hawks to sit in a stunned silence. He sighed, standing up from the couch.

“Look, man. I know this may come off as threatening, but I’m dead serious when I say we’re just looking out for everyone here. Just stop it, and everything will be just fine. Trust me, hurting you and your family will just bring us a shit ton more problems, myself included. All we want is for everything to go back to normal, and for us all to focus on finding the actual bad guys. You’re on vacation, you’re home, you’re with your family. That should be your priority, not picking at old wounds that aren’t even yours. I’m sure you’re just trying to do what you believe is right. Hell, I would jump at the chance to work with All Might too. But, you’ve been a loyal and important HPSC member for twenty-years. You should know more than anyone that we just have everyone’s best interests at heart. We’re just trying to keep everyone safe and happy. Unfortunately, you just can’t please everyone. All Might isn’t excluded from that. I wish things were different, I really do. But, it’s just the way it is.” Hawks clapped his hand on Hisashi’s shoulder, giving it a firm shake, “Move on. For all our sakes. That kid of yours seems like he’s got a really bright future in the Hero game. I wouldn’t squander that.”

He walked around the couch, heading back towards the balcony. But, once he reached the door, he turned back and looked down the hall.

“Have a good night, you two. Mrs. Midoriya, thank you so much for your unending hospitality. I’ll use the door next time, I promise. I wish you both the best.”

With that, Hawks stepped out and flew off into the night sky. 

  
  
  

***~...AMP…~***

  
  

A few city blocks away, lying prone on an apartment building rooftop, Kaina smiled as she gazed through her scope, watching Hawks fly away.

“...Gotcha.”

**A/N: ...So, about Ibara. Technically, there hasn't been a formal decision on whether or not this is actually a ship, or simply someone that helps Katsuki in his redemption arc. And, no, Katsuki isn't going to be converted. I'm not particularly religious myself either. A friend of mine pitched this idea, and I think these two legitimately have a lot of story potential, and their dynamic could be very interesting. Kirishima will also start to involve himself more too.**

**We've also reached the point where I need to begin the story outline for the Overhaul Arc, so we're movin' our way through, folks.**
