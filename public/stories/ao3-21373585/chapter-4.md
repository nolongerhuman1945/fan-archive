***...~AIV~...***

"Okay, now play every G key." Izuku did as he was told, roaming his fingertips across the piano. His appendages only paused a couple times, hesitating as the teen wasn't sure he was about to press the right key. "Hey, you got them all! A through G, every single one right."

"I-I did!? Really!?"

"Yeah. Nice, Deku. You're a seriously fast learner. You should help me with my homework. Now all you need to do is figure out how to press the keys in a quick enough, perfect succession in the right order and rhythm to create a song,” she said, looking at her friend with a smirk.

“...Damn it.”

Kyouka laughed at her friend’s expense, and turned around to look back at her alarm clock to see it read 9:00 p.m. "Oh shit. I didn't realize how late it was." 

"Oh...I guess I-...I-I should probably get going."

"Yeah…" Both teens looked down in disappointment. The day had gone by perfectly. Even the hiccups in the middle with Katsuki had been a good thing in the end. Izuku, for once in his life, had someone that he could talk to. 

He knew their friendship was still a short one. A *very* short one. He felt that he was to blame. Perhaps he was so desperate and so longing for companionship of any kind that he rushed full force at Kyouka. He was a man in a desert who had gone 11 years without water. And suddenly, a glass of water appeared before him.

Izuku extremely quickly glanced over at Kyouka again. His eyes, just for a split second (It was all the time his conscious would allow), dashed towards her slender and curved body. Her leather pants hugging her hips and legs just right. The side of her shirt falling off of her shoulder showing off her pearly white, porcelain skin. 

...A slender, *boiling hot* glass of water.

And instead of preserving the water, or savoring it, he chugged it down fast. He had clung to her so quickly, he was afraid that he would lose her just as fast. He had dumped so much on her so fast. Was she just going along with it so as to not hurt his feelings?

...No. No it couldn't be.

He didn't know why. He had never had a real reason to trust anybody. But, he trusted her completely. Kyouka's desire to accept him and actually *want* to be his friend just proved how much of an amazing person she was. And she somehow made Deku, the name he hated with a passion for the last 11 years of his life, the name that reminded him of being useless and weak, into a source of pride. She had plunged into his heart, grabbed onto whatever dark power Katsuki had put over him with that word, beat the shit out of it, mocked and teased it until it cried in a corner, forced it to be good, and then shoved it right back.

She had done more than enough for him to gain his trust ten times over. Izuku believed that he couldn’t have asked for anyone better to start his better life with.

“I could start learning something else. You can teach me the guitar now!”

“You can’t avoid my old man forever.” Izuku sighed and stood up from the piano bench. As they made it to the door, Kyouka put a hand on his shoulder. “Quick warning: My dad’s quirk is 'Voice Box', and he can change his voice to have effects and all that. He does a lot of background vocals for my mom. But, he also likes to do this scary voice to intimidate people. Just letting you know.”

Kyouka opened the door to her room and the two began walking down the stairs.

“He also tends to get a little…” The two teens stopped at the bottom of the staircase to see Kyoutoku in a dark cloak sitting straight across from the two. Long rows of candles lit up the pitch black room. An eerie violin played in the background. “...dramatic.”

**“** **Y** ***ou have entered my home and seduced my daughter? I see. So you have chosen...death.”***

“First of all: NO! And second, I already told him about the voice.”  
  

“God-damn it! Why do you guys always have to ruin this for me?” 

The lights suddenly flicked on to reveal Mika holding the violin. “Sorry, honey. You know there’s no letting one slip past Kyouka. Now, Kyouka I think it’s time you introduce your friend here.”

Kyouka crossed her arms and looked away, “Mom, Dad, this is Izuku Midoriya. He’s cool. Izuku, these are my parents. They’re clearly not.”

Kyoutoku squinted his eyes, “First name basis?”

Izuku, who was still blushing at the “seduced my daughter” line, walked up to the two and bowed. “It’s a-an honor to meet you both. I’ve only known Kyouka for a short amount of time, but her friendship means so much to me. I’m sorry for my rude entrance into your home. However, I’ve come to realize that it’s usually best to just do what Kyouka says.”

Kyoutoku couldn’t help but chuckle a little bit, “You get used to it.”

Mika placed her instrument on the coffee table and walked over to Izuku, her eyes squinting in curiosity. She grabbed onto his face, moving him around to look at every angle. She examined his black and green tufts, spread his eyelids open, squished his cheeks, and finally looked inside of his mouth. “Hmmm...What do you think, Kyou?” 

“I don’t like him, Mika.”

“Okay. Now, your *honest* opinion?”

Kyoutoku gave the same expression as his daughter. Crossing his arms and looking away, he mumbled, “...He’s okay...I guess. But I swear if you’re pervin’ on my daught-!”

“Okay! It’s late and Izuku has to go home before his mother gets worried! C’mon, Green Bean.” She grabbed onto Izuku’s hand and began walking towards the front door. 

Kyoutoku jumped out of his chair, “Handholding and cute nicknames!? Mika, hold me back!” Before he could even take his first step forward, Kyouka turned around with her jacks brandished and a fiery look in her eye that sent the fear of the Gods into her father. “...Have a nice night, Midoriya.”

“I-It was nice meeting you!” Kyouka closed the door behind them. The teens stood outside on Kyouka’s front porch in the moonlight. 

Kyouka shook her head and sighed, “Sorry about him. He can be overdramatic.”

Izuku chuckled, “Trust me, I know the feeling. But, I really would like to meet them for real sometime.”

The girl nodded, “Well, you should be around here pretty often. So, you’ll get plenty of chances.”

“Often?”

“You want lessons, don’t you? Besides, what better things do you have to do other than be with me?” 

“You make a fantastic point. But, what better things do *you* have to do other than be with *me* ?"

"...Shut up."

Izuku chuckled and looked down the pathway leading towards the sidewalk. The glow in the windows of the other houses lit up the streets along with the street lamps and pale moonlight. The path home. The problem was he didn’t want to go home. “H-Hey, Kyouka? I...I just...I wanted to say just how much today meant t-”

“I think we’ve had enough mushiness for one day, don’t you think?”

Izuku paused at the serious look on her face. “Oh, u-uh, yeah. Sorry. I don’t mean to be so ov-” Izuku saw a small smile just barely break free. “...You’re messing with me, aren’t you?”

She suddenly grabbed onto Izuku’s shoulders and shoved him down one of the steps on the porch. Due to Izuku’s descent, the two were now eye level.

“Yep.” Izuku was surprised as her jacks wrapped around his shoulders. A sort of 'hug', in a way. “I get it. It meant a lot to me too. Thank you, for today and for trusting me.”

Izuku’s damn tear ducts betrayed him as a few began leaking from his eyes. Kyouka saw his tears, but didn't comment ont them. Instead, she used her jacks to pull him into a real hug. She wasn't one to just give those out, but he both needed it and earned it. It was the first hug(?) he had ever received from anyone besides his mother. He managed to gain control of his arms and put his arms around her waist tightly. He breathed in deeply and sighed, but unintentionally caught Kyouka’s fragrance. A sweet, delicate fragrance hit his nostrils. He was immediately addicted. Although, it was highly ironic for Kyouka for all people to have a sweet and delicate smell. 

Well, she was sweet in her own way. Besides, delicate didn’t just mean fragile. It meant pleasant, a fineness to structure. Kyouka was certainly those things...She was pleasantly structured...He needed to stop that train of thought.

“By the way…” Kyouka’s jacks suddenly wrapped around his throat. They were very loose, so Izuku knew it wasn’t a real threat. “If you tell anyone about this hug, I’ll kill you.”

“Who exactly am I going to tell? Even if I could, are you ashamed of me?”

“Kinda.” Izuku laughed, her tone telling him that she was joking. She pulled back, lightly jabbing him with her jacks. “Now get outta here.”

Izuku stepped down from the porch with a smile. As he reached the sidewalk, he turned around. “When are we going to hang out again? Or when is my next lesson?”

Kyouka shrugged, “Whenever, I guess. I’m not busy. Or just whenever we’re bored.”

“...So tomorrow then?”

Kyouka stepped through her door and turned around to face him, “Don’t press your luck.”

She closed the door, gone from Izuku’s sight. The corners of the teen’s mouth stayed up as he began walking down towards the street. He only got a few feet before his phone buzzed. He pulled his device out of his pocket to see a text.

**\[Jirou\]: I’m bored. So what’s up?**

Izuku chucked and shook his head. He walked out towards the sidewalk and back to the train station. The inheritor pulled out and plugged in his headphones, *Songbird* by Fleetwood Mac. He paused as he listened to the song, suddenly skipping to the next song on his playlist.

Kyouka had ruined the song for him. The original didn’t hold a candle to his best friend. No 'default' needed.

***...~AIV~...***

Kyouka smiled down at the text she sent Izuku, happy with her joke. She stepped back into the main room to see her parents again. “So, I’m assuming you didn’t tell Dad about him?”

Mika chuckled, “I wanted to see his reaction. Although, I didn’t expect you to bring him over so soon.”

“It was kind of impromptu. Trust me, I wouldn’t want you two embarrassing me any further. Speaking of which…”

“Here we go.” Kyoutoku pulled out three pairs of earplugs. He gave the second and third pair to his wife. Two went in her ears, and she stabbed her jacks into the others. “Proceed.”

“Are you freaking kidding me?! 'Entered my house and seduced my daughter'?! What is wrong with you!? Why would you say that!? You’re just so-” Kyoutoku and Mika watched their daughter with no clue what she was saying. Well, they knew. They just didn’t want their eardrums blown out. They knew their daughter was usually a low voiced, kept-to-herself kind of person. Even to them, sharing her feelings wasn’t exactly something common. It took a toll on her just to tell them she wanted to be a hero.

...Except when she was pissed.

Eventually, Kyouka stopped yelling. The parents took out their ear plugs, and Mika asked, “Are you done?”

“...Yes.”

“Honey, you know your father. He takes protecting you to a serious degree, and that includes being suspicious of your romantic interes-”

“Friend.”  
  

“Sure, why not? Your father is only doing his job, and I have the obligation to help him. I already made my judgement when I saw him. And…” Mika walked up to her daughter and held her shoulders. “...He. Was so. Cute.”

Kyoutoku jumped up, exasperated hands thrown into the air, “Mika!? I thought you were on my side!”

“Sweetheart, I promised to judge him fairly and honestly. So, I am. He was polite and adorable.”

“No! We’re supposed to judge him as parents would: Completely unfairly and with an overprotective bias!”

“Oh come on, Kyou. We’ve barely even spoken with him.”

“Does he even play an instrument!?”

“That doesn’t matter.”

“It does in my unfair and biased opinion! So Kyouka, does this boy play an instrument?”

*\*Slam\**

Both parents turned to see Kyouka had vanished, and the sound of her bedroom door closing echoed from up the stairs. Mika turned to her husband, “Now that she’s gone, how did you really feel?”

Kyoutoku slumped down on the couch, “It was like trying to hate a puppy. I can’t. Doesn’t mean he has to know that yet.”

Mika smiled, “You’ll have to tell that to Kyouka soon. Whether she acts like it or not, our approval still matters to her. We don't want her to feel like we’re against her. You can’t say no to her anyway. You never could.”

Mika sat down next to her husband and leaned into him as Kyoutoku sighed, “15, going to hero school, and now that boy will probably be her boyfriend if what you think is true...When did she grow up? Last I checked, she was still playing that little guitar in this living room.”

Mika shrugged, “Who knows? All that matters is that her future stays bright and that we support her. Do you know what that includes?”

“...Is it supporting her romantic inter-”

“Supporting her romantic interests, correct.”

Kyoutoku raised his hands in defeat, “I’ll get to know the kid. I promise.” 

Up at the top of the stairs, an earphone jack listened in. It retracted back to the bedroom door it came from and back to Kyouka’s shoulder. The teen smiled, happy that Izuku’s relationship with her family was already a sealed deal. She knew her old man always exaggerated with that kind of stuff, but was a softie at heart. Now that the first situation was taken care of, Kyouka needed to deal with her other dilemma.

She quickly rushed to her mirror and frantically looked herself over. What the hell did Izuku see? Breath-taking? Model? What was he talking about? Kyouka wasn’t one for stereotypes, but maybe the nerd needed glasses. All she saw was a flat-chested, boyish-framed punk. The only thing she could find that was decent on her was the make-up.

...The fucking make-up.

The thing used to cover her ugliness.

Kyouka stomped over to her desk/make-up table and aggressively pulled off her combat boots, throwing them to her closet door. She grabbed the make-up wipes and quickly took everything off of her face. Once she was done, she looked at her reflection.

 And just like everyday, she didn’t like what she saw. 

She stood up, her hand grabbing the hem of her shirt. She flung it off, now only in a tank top and her pants and socks. She was unbuckling her belt, but stopped herself. What was the point? Looking at her body would just make herself feel even worse. Kyouka walked over to her bed and sat down with her head in her hands. Her chest hurt. It always hurt when she thought about it. 

Izuku had been the first person besides her parents to ever compliment her appearance. Hell, he more than just complimented her appearance. He praised and gawked over her appearance. She never believed her parents. It always felt like more of an obligation than true honesty. They were her parents, so they had to say she was beautiful. But, Izuku was someone new. He was her friend. He had already made it clear that he trusted her by sharing his story, and he was so pure that she couldn’t imagine him lying. At least, not for something so petty as appearance. Especially when he said she was important to him.

...So why didn’t she believe him?

*"...You look breathtaking."* 

*“You could be a model."*

*"I mean, you wouldn't have to wear a bunch of make-up or anything like they do. But, you could easily be one."*

Every word he said sounded so genuine. But, every time she looked in the mirror, she just couldn’t understand. She wasn’t even plain. She wished-...No, she would beg to be plain over what she was. The pain in her chest began to constrict on her. The teen shook her head to clear her thoughts, but it didn’t work. Kyouka opted for the next option of simply shutting down her brain and going to sleep. She finished unbuckling her pants and kicked them off. Kyouka slipped under the covers and extended her jack to flip her lightswitch. The room turned completely dark save for the light under the door, her clock, and strands of moonlight coming through the curtains. 

Even with her eyes closed and her body warm underneath the blankets, her train of thought was keeping her from sleeping. She hated nights like this. Kyouka was supposed to be tough and not take anyone’s crap.

But, no matter how tough her exterior was, an attack from the inside couldn’t be stopped.

She could take anyone’s crap but her own. She just couldn’t help it. How do you avoid something that you have to look at everyday? Her body began to feel uncomfortable. It wasn’t a discomfort that could be solved with a scratch or a shifting of positions. She couldn’t escape the discomfort that was her own body. 

*\*Bzzt\**

Her phone buzzed on her bedside table, and Kyouka almost didn’t pick it up. But, she pushed herself to reach her arm over and pick up her phone. She squinted at the light, and as her eyes adjusted Izuku’s name appeared.

**\[Broccoli Boy\]: I know we essentially said the general thoughts, but I feel like I still need to say something. So, about what I was going to say earlier, thank you so much. I don’t want my past to be used for pity or anything. I don’t want that. So thank you for not pitying me. You just accepted me. I’ve never really had that before, and it’s all I wanted. I promise, even if I don’t make it into U.A and you go on to do amazing things, I’ll be the best friend you need too. I doubt I’ll be as amazing as you, but I’ll try.**

Kyouka looked at the text and the constriction on her chest loosened. It was there, but just less so. How did that cute, handsome, awkward, stuttering, jacked, pure-hearted, adorable, freckle-faced bastard always manage to make her feel better?

Well, she knew. Especially if all of the adjectives she used were anything to go by.

She scoffed to herself. Having crushes was never her style. It wasn’t like they would be attracted to her anyway...Although, Izuku seemed to like her looks. Whatever little bubble of hope appeared in her heart was immediately popped by her own mind. *‘He had to have been just doing pleasantries or something. He’s not the kind of person to just negatively comment on someone's appearance.’* 

She would just have to settle for what they had.

 Kyouka held her phone to her chest and completely burrowed under her blankets. 

***...~AIV~...***

“Mom, I’m home.” Izuku walked into the living room to see his Inko sitting on the couch in her pajamas watching T.V.

“You’re home much later than I expected. I was getting worried.”

Izuku took off his jacket and hung it up on the rack. “Sorry. I stopped by Kyouka’s house for a bit.”

He watched his mother suddenly perk up. “Kyouka?”  
  

“Uh, yeah. Th-That’s her first name.”

Inko stood up, “I know...and you’re using it.”

Izuku paused, “Mom, it’s not-”

“And you were at her house, after spending all day alone with her.”

“Mo-”

“And you have women’s perfume on you.” Izuku lifted his arm and took a whiff. His mother was right. Whatever Kyouka was wearing must have rubbed off on him. “Oh, Izuku...I’m not ready to be a grandmother yet.”

Izuku shook his head, “Mom, you know nothing happened.”

She began to giggle, “I know, I know. But, c’mon. Tell me what happened. How did it go? Where did you go?”

Izuku faltered for a second and began shifting on his feet. “Uh...N-Nothing. We just walked around.” 

“I know that’s not true. You’ve been walking around on your phone all day for the past few days with this girl. Tell me what happened. Was it fun?”

“Uh, y-yeah. Mom, I’m gonna go to bed. I’m pretty tired.”

Inko’s smile faltered just a tad, “O-Oh. Alright, goodnight, sweetheart.”

“Night.” Izuku walked his way back to his bedroom and shut the door behind him. He ran a hand through his hair as he sighed. Izuku walked to his desk and sat down as he thought back to the night.

Kyouka was outstanding. Everything just felt right with the world when he was with her. Maybe that was why it took him so long to get a friend. His patience was rewarded, and 11 years (15 from a certain point of view) of waiting was worth it. 

And she was a girl. A gorgeous, talented, cool, funny girl. And he could talk to her! Actual sentences! 

And all of those feelings about her gave Izuku a light feeling in his chest. He was well aware of what it was going to turn into. Scratch that, not turn into. He knew what it already was, and there was no denying it.

He liked her. A lot. He couldn't get her out of his brain, and her appearance from bored look, to glare, to smiling, to smirking, was all burned into the back of his eyelids. 

She made him laugh. 

She made him actually feel good about himself. 

She could sing like an angel and play anything.

She wanted to be a hero.

She was the definition of cool.

And Izuku knew that he had thought it already so much, but he just could not stress enough just how unbelievably beautiful she was. He was going to have to watch a bunch of light-hearted videos before bed to avoid any “interesting” dreams so seeing her the next day wouldn’t make anything awkward for him.

There was just the problem of him being...Well, Izuku. 

Although, there was one thing he needed to find out about her. Izuku quickly booted up his computer and began typing. He searched “popular sweet perfumes” and began searching.

...Was it creepy to be searching what a girl smelled like?

‘ *...Yeah. Yeah, it is.’*

Buuut his fingers didn’t stop typing. He eventually came upon the products that were flower-based. One immediately caught his eye, Izuku looked at the description and he knew it had to be it. 

Violets.

...Izuku never thought he would ever have a favorite flower.

***...~AIV~...***

**(The Next Week)**

**\[Kyouka\]:** Dude I swear if you don’t get here in the next 5 minutes I’m going to gouge your eyes out.

**\[Broccoli Boy\]:** I’m trying!

Izuku bolted out of the train station and ran out onto the sidewalk heading to the residential area. In his hand he held an envelope from UA mailed to his apartment that morning. The pair had told each other that they would open their acceptance letters together. Or, in Izuku’s case, his likely rejection letter. 

Over the week he became nervous every time he thought about the letter. No matter what he did to the Zero Pointer, it was still worth no points. He was tempted to just pull the bandaid off quickly and call All Might to ask if he had passed or not. But, he promised Kyouka to open the letters together. Well, technically she was the one that promised and Izuku was the one that made the suggestion. She originally thought it was cheesy, but relented. They had made sure to see each other every day they could over the week.

...Which turned out to be literally everyday.

Even if only for a couple of hours after school, they latched back together until the sun was down and the moon was high in the sky.

During school hours people began to look at him strangely. Not that people didn't stare weirdly at him to begin with being the quirkless outcast and all. Quirkless to them, that is. But, this stare was a different one. They seemed weirded out by him. He didn't realize what was wrong until yesterday when he went into the bathroom and looked into the mirror.

He had been smiling. 

He had been thinking about Kyouka all day everyday, and slipped in texts whenever he could during class. He had been smiling every day, and people were utterly confused. Izuku understood why. He *never* smiled. He didn't look at anyone or even speak during school hours. Hell, he hardly smiled at home. But, now he was smiling all the time. He probably should've guessed something was off when even Bakugou looked at him funny.

Kyouka's effect on his life was already drastic. It was almost scary how fast it was.

Her house came into view, and Izuku rushed up to the front door. Before he could ring the doorbell, it swung open to reveal two jacks dangerously close to his eyeballs. Izuku looked around the appendages and pushed down the stutter in his chest when Kyouka was wearing ripped jeans and a red, deep v-neck "Sex Pistols" shirt. 

"For a guy with a body enhancing quirk, you're really damn slow."

"I'd break my legs!"

"Meh," Kyouka shrugged. Her jacks snaked around his arm as she yanked him towards the stairs. "Now, c'mon. I've been waiting forever."

Izuku quickly turned and waved at Kyoutoku and Mika before he was pulled up the stairs. Being at Kyouka's most nights allowed him to properly speak to them...Kinda...

...And it was even more awkward than he thought it would be.

***...~AIV~...***

**(The Night After The Outing)**

"Oh, hello, M-Mr. Jirou. I'm here to-AH!" Izuku was yanked into the house and shoved onto the couch. Kyoutoku sat across from, staring at him with a stone-cold glare. The two sat in complete silence as Izuku sat wide-eyed, not knowing what to say or do. “...U-...Um…”

“Dad! I heard the doorbell. Is Izuku here?” Kyouka’s voice traveled down the stairs to the living room. The father didn’t even acknowledge it as he continued to simply stare at the house guest. 

Izuku nervously gestured towards the stairs, “Um...I-I should g-” Suddenly, Kyoutoku’s eyes slowly widened into an even more intense and scary glare. His eyes wide saucers, but his brows still furrowed. A quick, high, and sharp tune began to play as he continued to glare. Izuku raised a brow in confusion and turned around to see Mika, once again, playing her violin behind the couch.

Mika gave a little wave, “Hello again, Midoriya. Sorry about this. He likes to have his own theme music. You can go ahead up to Kyouka. He’s not going to stop. Kyou is convinced he can scare you away from coming back.”

“W-Well, I wouldn’t stop as long as Kyouka is here.”

“Good answer.” She nodded her head towards the stairs and Izuku got up. Keeping eye contact with Kyoutoku, he awkwardly moved around the couch and towards the stairs.

Mika walked out the room, leaving Izuku and Kyoutoku alone. Izuku sat with wide eyes at the staircase, not knowing what to do with that information. Kyoutoku turned around on the couch and pointed two fingers at his own eyes, and then two at Izuku.

Kyouka jogged down the stairs, “Dude, what’s taking you so long? Why’re yo-” She turned to see her father staring down Izuku. “Oh my-...You’ve gotta be kidding me.”

She grabbed Izuku and took him up the steps.

***...~AIV~...***

**(Present)**

  
  

So, yeah. Not exactly the most ideal official meeting with your crush’s parents.

But, at the very least, he had Mika on his side. 

He and Kyouka entered her room and she took him to her desk. She pulled up another stool and sat him down. Side by side, both teens pulled out their envelopes and placed them on the desk. They looked at each other and Kyouka nodded to the envelopes. “Who first?”

Izuku pushed Kyouka’s to her, “I’ll stall the pain.”

She hit his arm, “Shut up. You’re getting in. In fact…” Kyouka swiftly grabbed Izuku’s letter and tore it open before he could react.

“Wha-! What are you doing?!”

“I’m so confident you got in that we’re doing yours first and getting it out of the way.” 

“But-”

**“I AM HERE AS A PROJECTION!!!”** Both teens looked in shock at the large picture of All Might in front of them. **“It’s been a bit since I've done promotional work like this. But, it is for good reason. I am actually in town to teach at U.A!”**

Izuku’s jaw dropped. Toshinori never told him about that. Even Kyouka looked a little shocked, “Wow. I can’t believe they got All Might to actually settle down and teach. I would ask if you’re excited about that, but your jaw on my floor says enough.” Over the last week, Kyouka became aware of Izuku’s obsession with the number one hero. She had yet to see his room, but when she asked him how much merchandise he had of All Might, all he said was “Yes”.

**“I actually...Hm?”** Someone from off-screen began talking. **“What? Get to the point? Okay I-...I’m sorry, I have to do how many of these? How many people did they take!? Ugh, alright. Ahem. Young Midoriya, as well as you did on the written exam, you scored zero Hero Points. Which naturally results in failure.”**

Izuku grimaced and gripped his pant leg. He scrunched his face up in pain and tears welled in his eyes. *‘...I’m so pathet-’*

“Stupid school!”

Izuku flinched away and stared in awe as Kyouka stood from her chair and stomped to the other side of her room, cursing more times in a sentence than even Katsuki ever had. Kyouka would always say the occasional curse, but it wasn’t much.

This however...

“Stupid school and their stupid God-damn points and their stupid dumbass standards.” She grabbed her electric guitar, raised it into the air, and stomped back to the table. She raised her guitar and was just about to smash it down onto the metal projector disk.

**“However!”** Kyouka stopped, her guitar mere inches from the disk. “ **That is not the end of the story.”**

A video of the girl Izuku had saved from the Zero Pointer appeared. How they got the video of the scene, Izuku would never know. 

*“Um, excuse me? Do you know the boy from my exam area? Curly hair, freckles, plain-looking?”*

Kyouka squinted her eyes at the last description, *‘Wow. I don't think that was necessary, asshole.’*

*“I could hear talking after he saved me, and he mentioned that he didn’t have any points. He sacrificed passing to save my life, all because I screwed up. Please, give him some of my points. Whatever amount you can.”*

AAAnd Kyouka immediately felt bad for calling her that. Instant karma. Izuku was still gobsmacked beside her. 

**“You see, we tricked you. Villain points were not the only factor. What kind of hero school would we be if we didn’t accept people with true heroism in their hearts?”**

In the video, Present Mic patted Uraraka’s head. *“That’s real kind of you. But, even if we could do that, there’s no need.”*

**“You heard him right! No need at all! Because Young Midoriya, you’ve been awarded 60 rescue points! A PASSING GRADE!”** The crunch of Kyouka’s guitar hitting the floor was the only noise made. Izuku’s tears were flowing, but not out of sadness. **“Congratulations, young man. You’re in. Welcome to your hero academia.”**

*\*Blip\**

The image flickered off, and Kyouka dropped her guitar as she looked over to Izuku. “Is it a bad time to say I told you so?”

Izuku stood up and wiped the tears from his eyes. He latched onto Kyouka with a tight hug. “For once, it’s the one time I want to hear it.”

That phrase, “I told you so”, was a phrase that Izuku expected to hear from everyone else whenever he was quirkless and failed the exam. But now...Now someone believed in him. Of course All Might believed in him, too. Although, Kyouka was different. With All Might, Izuku had to show off heroic actions that nearly got himself killed just to gain the hero’s approval. With Kyouka, it was simply by being himself.

For once, someone believed in him. And finally, it came to fruition.

“Is hugging for you just going to be a thing?”

“Oh, sorry!” Izuku pulled his arms back, but they were immediately put back into place by Kyouka.

“I didn’t say stop. I was just asking.” Kyouka put her arms around his shoulders, embracing him back.  She was just as excited as Izuku was. A hug wouldn’t hurt.

...It also helped that whenever Izuku hugged her, her body stopped feeling wrong. 

***...~AIV~...***
