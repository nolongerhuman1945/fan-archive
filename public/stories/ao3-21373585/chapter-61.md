**A/N: This took a little while to make, because of two main reasons. One being that I kept diverting time to my side-project. It's just really pissing me off that it just refused to end, because I keep making it longer.**

**But, the second reason is that I find fights really tough to write for. You have to visualize the setting, the places it takes them, how all of their powers interact, etc. It's just exhausting, at least at first.**

**Next chapter will start the wrap up for a lot of loose threads, except the larger HPSC progression as you'll soon read. That'll be in affect for a while, if not the rest of the story.**

**It will also be where we fully start to shift into the Overhaul Arc.**

Toshinori sped down the street, weaving past the few cars that were on the street at this hour. “You see them?”

Ryuko pulled her head back in from the window, shaking her head, “The buildings are too tall. I need to get high up.”

Swerving to the right, Toshinori stopped the car on an empty street. They both jumped out of the car, scanning the rooftops to find his students. “Go. I’ll follow you.”

Ryuko sighed, shaking her head, “But, what about-?”

“Don’t worry about me,” Toshinori shook his head, urging her to go on. “I’m not much help in a fight, I’ll catch up. Just go!”

Ryuko nodded, crouching down with her hand on the road, the ground rumbling beneath her. She jumped up, a pillar of rock shooting up from the ground and launching Pixie Bob up into the air. She disappeared over the rooftops, leaving Toshinori by himself.

Luckily, they weren’t on a main street. At this hour it was pretty barren. Toshinori scanned the rooftops again, readying himself to get back in the car. However…

He froze, eyes locking on the rooftop at the end of the road before it turned. 

Standing up above, black coat flowing in the wind, Tomura Shigaraki was staring directly at him. They stared at one another, dark clouds rolling in from the distance. 

*\*Bzzzt\**

Toshinori looked down, feeling his phone vibrate in his pocket. He looked back up, finding Tomura had vanished. 

“...That can’t be good.” 

He pulled out his phone, seeing a text from the number Kaina had been texting him from. It was an address he didn’t recognize. It definitely wasn’t her current location, but it had to be important. He copied the address and he ran back to his car, sending it to both Torino and Tsukauchi. 

  
  

***~...AMP…~***

  
  

Tomura reappeared on a rooftop nearby, peering around the corner of the roof access door, watching All Might get back into his car. 

Kurogiri appeared next to him through the vortex, following Tomura’s gaze, “Shouldn’t you be watching Ms. Tsutsumi’s fight?”

Tomura shrugged, watching All Might drive down the road, the rumble of thunder echoing from afar. “She can handle herself. Besides…He’ll take us to her.”

“Young Tomura, do you really want to-?”

“Just follow him,” Tomura answered curtly, not turning back to look at him. “I’ll tell you when to bring her over.”

“...Of course.”

  
  
  

***~...AMP…~***

  
  

**(****Musutafu Building Rooftop****)**

  
  

Like a hail of thorns, dozens of sharp crimson feathers shot right at them with little warning. Izuku and Kyouka dodged backwards, flipping and maneuvering out of their way in a show of gymnastics. However, in their successful effort to dodge the feathers, they careened past them towards the defenseless Lady Nagant. 

Izuku fired electricity from his back, hitting the feathers and knocking them out of Hawks immediate control. Kyouka’s jacks were on them at blinding speeds, capturing the feathers up in a bundle. She flung them back at Hawks, small purple sparks flashing to life on her skin.

Hawks deadpanned at the interception, the feathers stopping midair in front of his body. “...Really?”

Kyouka groaned as the feathers turned back towards them, “Shit.”

“C’mon!” Izuku shouted, rushing back towards Kaina, the whistle of the feathers behind them. He grabbed a very confused Nagant’s arm and leaped off of the rooftop, Kyouka right behind him. “His feathers work with-!”

“Echolocation, I got it!” Kyouka shouted back.

Kyouka turned in the air, already knowing what Izuku was getting at. Her jacks shot out in different directions as they fell with the rain, piercing tunnels of sound echoing into the sky. The feathers that chased them diverted from their path, their trajectories all confused from Kyouka’s distraction instead. 

They landed on the shorter building nearby, with Izuku holding Nagant, Hawks feathers piercing the roof in random spots. Kyouka’s jacks reached over to the fire escape door, piercing the metal and ripping it off with ease. Izuku set her down, nodding over to the door, “Hide inside. We’ll handle this.”

“Handle i-? He’s a Pro! I-...And how the hell do you know who I am?!”

“Very long story-AH!” Izuku was suddenly yanked to the side by Kyouka’s jack, a feather piercing the roof where he stood. They all looked back up to the top of the skyscraper, seeing Hawks’ wings spread out against the black clouds, lightning flashing behind him, his feathers joining the rain in their descent. “One I don’t have time to tell! Go!”

Kyouka spiraled her jacks into the air, soundwaves bursting into the air and disrupting the feather’s flight path. She turned back to Nagant with a smile and a shrug, “If it at all makes you want to stay and find out, All Might’s gonna be so happy to see you again!”

“...Who the hell are you two?!” Kaina shouted in pure incredulity. 

“The ones who are gonna save you!” / “The ones who are gonna save you!”

“Cute.” The couple dodged back as Hawks slammed down on the building, two feather blades piercing the rooftop, a horde of feathers floating behind him. “You guys practice that?”

“Yes.” / “No.” Izuku and Kyouka responded respectively, with the latter elbowing her boyfriend. “Maybe”/ “Maybe.”

“Damn it, kid.” Kaina used her rifle to push herself up onto her feet, shaking her head at Hawks. “They never had me kill anyone as young as these two. Nowhere close. You really can’t see the problem here?”

“Of course I do,” Hawks sighed, shaking away the bad thoughts so he could focus. “Makes me sick…But, it’s like I told you. If bearing the weight of these burdens is what it takes to help everyone, then…so be it.”

“What about the burdens you put on everyone close to the people you kill? Husbands? Wives? Fathers, mothers, sons and daughters, it just keeps going. You don’t help anyone. The best way to help the world is to purge the corruption from it. The right way this time, mind you. Not by blowing their heads off.”

“Based on your line of thought, I’m corrupted too.”

“You were never given a choice. You were just a kid.”

Hawks pulled his feathers out from the cement, pointing one at Kaina, “I’ve let you talk plenty tonight. You’re not gonna turn me.”

“I’m not trying to turn you. I’m trying to save you; from the HPSC…and yourself.”

“They did save me,” Hawks’ wings spread out wide behind him, the feathers in the roof shaking as they pulled themselves out. “They saved me from going through more Hell…’Bout time I returned the favor.”

He began to levitate up, the Pro and the students staring each other down, waiting for the quick draw to commence. Izuku brought his fist back, his hand beginning to glow brightly as he condensed his excess power. Kyouka’s jacks rose up in front of her, a near silent ringing coming from them as they vibrated.The low rumble of thunder could be heard as rain clouds slowly cascaded over the city.

At the first crack of lightning, they attacked. 

A cyclone of feathers fired like bullets at the trio. Izuku threw his fist out, a shotgun blast of energy exploded from his hand as piercing soundwaves blasted from Kyouka’s jacks. The energy was trapped within the soundwaves, completely shredding some of the feathers and hitting Hawks directly. 

He was sent flying back, recovering with a flap of his wings. With a grunt of irritation, he fired himself at them, blades at the ready. However, his aim wasn’t at the students, but at Lady Nagant. He expected them to dodge out of the way, leaving Kaina wide open.

However, the duo ran right at him, a shockwave ringing out as they collided. They both dodged, Hawks’ blades sliding under their arms, locking Hawks into a grapple. With his speed, they were still forced back. But, with their combined strength, they managed to stop him. 

Hawks tried to move, but he couldn’t budge even an inch.

He’s seen the Midoriya kid during the Sports Festival, so that made sense. 

But, *why the fuck* was the chick so strong?”

Kyouka had the widest smirk on her face as she said, “Electricity beats flying-types, asshole!”

Izuku’s entire body began to glow, cyan energy beginning to dance across the entire rooftop. Hawks growled, his wings curling up and throwing themselves out as feathers shot out into the air. “Flying beats fighting!”

The feathers were coming at them from all directions, converging at one point. The couple pushed Hawks off of them, kicking Hawks in the gut and sending him back. Izuku released his energy like a bomb, rather than focused. As the feathers were thrown away, Kyouka felt Izuku’s sparks flow over her. She felt the hairs on her arms and back of her neck stand up, but she remained unharmed.

“Huh…Cool.” Kyouka took the Equalizer off of her back, and they both rushed Hawks. Hawks launched himself back at them, unable to get as much speed this time. His feather blades clashed with the Equalizer, his left wing sharpening and slashing at Izuku. He parried Kyouka away as Izuku slid under his wing. Hawks sharpened both wings, swinging himself around and just barely catching Izuku in the shoulder. It wasn’t a deep cut, but it was enough to draw blood.

He was on Izuku quickly, his blade at the ready, but…he faltered. He paused, his mind not able to attack.

In his moment of hesitation, Kyouka’s jack wrapped around Hawks’ ankle, pulling his foot out from under him and giving Izuku an opening. Izuku quickly took the opportunity, unleashing a full combo on Hawks. 

He circled around Hawks in a blitz of fists and light hitting all across his body in an instant, beginning to practically play tennis with Kyouka, and the Pro as the ball. Hawks was rocked to the side as Izuku slammed his fist into his jaw, and Kyouka hit him right back with the Equalizer.

Hawks tried to fly up, but Izuku grabbed one foot, and Kyouka’s jack grabbed the other, slamming him back down to the ground. 

Hawks yelled in anger, using his wings to spin his body around, feathers flying everywhere. Izuku and Kyouka moved back, mostly managing to dodge, but were grazed by quite a few feathers. 

Hawks got up, breathing heavily, eyes wide as he shook his head, “What the fuck is happening right now?!”

“This.” Hawks turned around at the voice, instantly getting slammed in the gut by a soft bullet fired from Kaina’s rifle. He was knocked back and off the building, coughing up blood.

The couple turned around, eyes wide as they simultaneously asked, *“Why* are you still here?!”

Kaina didn’t answer as she tore off a strip of the bottom of her dress, wrapping it tightly around her torso to put pressure over her wound. She had a strong feeling it wasn’t gonna do much good while still fighting, but it was at least something. 

“You two are really friends of Toshinori?”

“More of the found family trope,” Kyouka answered, her jacks perking up as it followed Hawks’ movements.

“He has a knack for that,” Kaina nodded, reloading her rifle. “You two have got some crazy amount of guts to take on a Pro, especially if you know he’s an assassin. Either that, or you’re just stupid and reckless.”

“Yeah, we get that a lot.” Kyouka’s jacks pointed in both directions, her eyes widening. “Oh boy.”

On both sides of the rooftop, dozens of feathers shot up, swirling around before launching themselves in a torrent directly aimed at Kaina. 

“C’mon!” Izuku shouted, bolting at Kaina and hooking his arm around Kaina’s waist. They ran to the roof access door, and once inside, Izuku slammed the door shut just as dozens of feather tips stabbed right through the metal. 

Kaina leaned over the stair railing, seeing the stairwell spiral all the way down to the bottom. “You kids got any sort of plan?”

“Keep him busy until Aizawa and Pixie Bob get here,” Izuku answered.

“Then we gotta keep him here.” Kaina shot her grapple into the ceiling, jumping down the stairwell, falling as the couple followed her in streaks of light running down the steps. She could hear the door bursting open echo from above. 

Hawks came through the door, the feathers in the door returning to his wings. He saw the hook in the ceiling, instantly slicing through Kaina’s grapple cable. She managed to grab onto the railing, hoisting herself up as Izuku rammed through the door to the floor they were on. 

They all ran inside, finding themselves in what seemed like an open cafeteria area for whatever company this building housed. There were circular tables spanning across the entire floor, rows of foliage lining the balcony above that led to the next floor, and empty, cloth-covered tables at the end of the room.

“Keep him distracted. I’ll supply cover fire.” Kaina shot her grapples from her belt, zipping across the room. 

Hawks suddenly flew through the door, firing more feathers at Kaina. Izuku kicked up one of the tables, moving in front of them and using it as a shield, the feathers impaling themselves into the wood. 

Kyouka’s jacks wrapped around the legs of another table, spinning around Izuku and throwing it at Hawks, while Izuku tossed his table up and kicked it at him. Hawks sharpened his wings, slashing through Kyouka’s table, and then controlled his feathers in Izuku’s table to fly apart, breaking the table into pieces before it could touch him. 

*\*KRACK\**

Hawks was then blown back by a bullet to the shoulder. Kaina might’ve been making them a lot softer so they were non-lethal, but it still hurt like hell. 

“Manchester!” Hawks looked up, seeing Izuku up in the air, an axe kick swinging down right for him. *“SMASH!!!”* 

Hawks flapped his wings to dodge, but Kyouka’s jacks wrapped around his ankle, yanking him back into place. Izuku’s foot slammed directly into Hawks’ gut, bouncing him off of the black tile floor as it cracked into thousands of pieces, the floor’s foundation revealing itself underneath. 

Kyouka blitzed to Hawks’ side as Izuku backed off, swinging her Equalizer down, “Fore!” 

Hawks was hit into the air, another bullet hitting his back, and Izuku finished the combo by grabbing Hawks and slamming him onto the floor. “Kyouka!” 

Kyouka was there in an instant, slamming the prongs of the Equalizer into the floor with Hawks’ in between, effectively pinning him. Izuku put his foot on Hawks’ back, grabbing both of his wings, ready to rip them right off. 

Hawks growled, knowing what Izuku was trying to do. Feathers fired out, curving around at the couple at blinding speeds. They had to back off, Kyouka ready to blast more sound waves at them. 

Taking the opportunity, Hawks used his whole body to push the Equalizer out of the ground, swinging around and slashing at the duo. Kyouka was caught just next to her collarbone, and Izuku just next to his abdomen. He hardened his wings, bashing them with their full force. The couple was sent flying, crashing through the windows and into the rain, plummeting below. 

Hawks threw the Equalizer up, his wing slamming into it and sending it careening towards Kaina. She dived behind one of the clothed tables, more feathers coming her way.

Izuku and Kyouka fell down to the ground with the rain. Izuku shouted over the wind as they fell, grabbing onto Kyouka. “Remember, keep your momentum!” 

Kyouka nodded, knowing what Izuku was getting at. He tossed her towards the building, her foot meeting the concrete, running back up the skyscraper in a streak of violet light clashing against the dark sky. 

Izuku spun around, making sure the incoming street below was empty. His arms began to glow as he overcharged his arms with his energy, folding all of his fingers behind his thumbs, ready to flick. 

He unleashed all of his excess power, flicking all of his fingers just before he hit the ground, launching him back up the side of the building like a bullet. 

Just as Hawks launched himself at Kaina, more blades at the ready, Kyouka appeared in the window. 

*\*SCKREEEE!!!\**

Soundwaves slammed into Hawks’ his heart palpitated from the sheer force and pressure. Every window on that floor, and the floors above and below, shattered in an instant. Hawks stumbled, his ears ringing as he shook his head. 

“What the fuck?! Gagh!” Hawks’ eyes went wide as a streak of violet zoomed past him, Kyouka’s jacks wrapping around his ankles. “Oh, come the fuck on-AH!”

Hawks’ feet were yanked out from under him as he was dragged back all the way back into the stairwell, Kyouka taking him for a joyride up flight after flight. She made it all the way back to the roof access door. Once outside, she swung Hawks around and threw Hawks into the air. 

“Pull!”

From the other side of the building, Izuku shot up, holding Kaina at the waist. He threw her up, her rifle at the ready and firing right into Hawks. He was thrown back, stopping himself with a flap of his wings. He was breathing heavily, eyes wide as his brain tried to process the last ten minutes as Izuku landed down on the rooftop, catching Kaina and setting her down on her feet. 

“RRRAAAAAGHH!!! What the fuck is happening today?! This can’t get any fucking worse.”

Kyouka closed her eyes, unable to hold in her laughter, “He said the magic words.”

Hawks’ feathers bristled, feeling something big flying towards him, “What the fu-Uughf!!!” 

A block of cement slammed into Hawks’ already broken ribs, sending him falling back down to the rooftop. Everyone turned to see Pixie Bob standing on the rooftop on the next building over. She jumped up, a pillar of concrete boosting her, falling and landing down next to AMP with the roof cracking under her feet. 

Izuku couldn’t help himself, pumping his fists a little and whispering, *“So cool…”*

Kaina instantly recognized her, doing her very best to turn invisible. But, it was evident that didn’t work when Ryuko snapped her head towards Kaina, the sniper’s eyes going wide as she started to march towards her.

“Uh, listen, about the night of the gala, I-”

Pixie Bob grabbed the collar of Kaina’s dress, dragging her in to be nose-to-nose with her, “Do you love Toshinori?”

Kaina’s eyes went wide, brow knit together, “Wh-?! You’re really doing this *right now?!”*

Pixie Bob growled in irritation, shoving Kaina away and turning back to the fight. She threw her cat gloves off, cracking her knuckles as the rooftop began to rumble. “Ok, pretty boy. You wanna see why cats and birds don’t mix?”

“I can take a wild guess, Sylvester.” Hawks sighed, still lying under the slab of concrete as realized just how unprepared he was for today. He pushed himself up with his wings, breathing heavily as he stared at his opponents, his errant feathers floating up. 

This was so fucking bad.

He was already getting wrecked by the other three, and now the cat lady? 

*“Hawks, come in.”* Madam President came through over his earpiece. *“This is worse than we thought. You need to-”*

“Shut the hell up, lady.” Kyouka shouted. “Pretty damn quick to order murder after murder. Is your only plan to dig yourself even deeper in the giant canyon you’ve made for yourself?”

“What will it solve?” Izuku continued after her. “You’re scrambling. Too many people know about you now. It’s not just us either. Our teacher knows. Do you think you can just get rid of him? Pixie Bob knows, and do you think her team will just accept her death and move on? All of our friends at UA will wonder what happened. And, we all know you won’t kill All Might, so he’ll tell all of them. Fighting is pointless. You’ve already lost.”

Hawks sighed, rolling his shoulder back with an alarming crack, “...They’re not wrong.”

*“I know. Abort mission, it’s over. We need to regroup and discuss our next steps. If the girl can hear me, then I would like to invite everyone to come to the HPSC in Tokyo. It’s clear now that fighting won’t solve this issue. What we need now is to come to an understanding and strike a deal.”*

Kyouka scoffed, “Yeah, I don’t think so. Just so everyone knows, she just said she wants us all to come down to the HPSC HQ and ‘come to an agreement’.”

“Ha!” Kaina bellowed out, stepping forward with a wide smile on her face, holding her side as her wound began to bleed through her make-shift bandage. “A deal? Ohoho, you really are desperate. If I were you, I’d just start packing your bags now, get ready to go into hiding. I know you’ll all think prison is above you.”

Suddenly, a voice rang out across the rooftop.

“No deals.” 

…Hawks’ furrowed his brow as his feathers stopped in the air, each one falling to the ground, completely unmoving. Hawks focused hard to control them again, but they wouldn’t budge. 

He turned towards the roof access, seeing two glowing eyes emerge from the doorway.

“...Eraserhead.”

Aizawa stepped through, hair raised up, his wrappings trailing behind him. “You’ve caused enough damage. Not just tonight, but spanning back decades. You’re not striking any deals, especially ones that take us right into the belly of the beast. And, Hawks? You’re coming with us.”

Hawks clicked his teeth together as he looked around at his opponents, “...An ex-assassin, two Pro Heros, and a couple of students who are way stronger than they should be…Yep, I think I’m done here.”

Hawks jumped back, a strong flap of his wings as he began flying off. Pixie Bob quickly stomped the ground, slabs of concrete floating upwards across the entire rooftop. She threw her arms out, launching the projectiles at Hawks from all directions. 

He began weaving past each of them with ease, trying to retain his speed. But, he noticed most of them weren’t aimed at him, but flying right past him. Hawks’ eyes widened as the concrete began to form together in front of him as one giant wall blocking out the moonlight. 

“Ooooh shit.”

Pixie Bob pulled her arms back, the wall of concrete rushing back at Hawks, “Rock beats Flying-type.”

“All the fucking Pokémon jokes,” Hawks groaned, having to change trajectory. With a strong flap of his wings, shot himself straight up, raising himself higher into the night sky, just barely dodging the wall.

“I’ve got him,” Kaina raised her rifle up, taking aim and ignoring the fact that blood was now dripping down to her shoes. “Get ready to-”

Kaina’s eyes widened as an all too familiar sound reached her ears. She looked down, finding a black, swirling vortex open up beneath her feet. “Oh, fuck me-”

Shigaraki’s hand shot through, grabbing Kaina’s ankle with his index finger raised, and yanking her in. Izuku dived forward, hand reaching out, but it was too late.

She was gone.

“We’ll deal with that later,” Aizawa growled, watching Hawks get further away. “My quirk can only do so much mutation. I’ll get him down to Earth, you two will do the rest. We’ve gotta clip his wings. I can’t believe I’m about to say this…Throw me.”

“On it,” Kyouka nodded, her jacks wrapping around Aizawa’s waist and raising him into the air as violet sparks began to rapidly dance around them. 

“Wait a second, hold on! I didn’t expect you to agree so QUICKLYYYY!!!” 

Aizawa was chucked into the air, Kyouka’s aim true as he flew directly towards Hawks. Hearing the screams echoing into the air, Hawks turned his head, eyes widening as he saw a thirty-one-year-old man flying at him like a bullet. “Holy fucking shi-ACK!!!”

They tumbled through the air, going higher and higher up. Aizawa hooked his scarf around the base of Hawks’ wings, pulling tightly just as they reached the clouds above. Hawks’ wings were bound together, and Aizawa’s quirk was stopping him from controlling his feathers telepathically.

…Which meant they began to plummet to the ground.

“You’re complicating things, Eraserhead!” Hawks yelled over the wind as all two of them fell to the city below. “You know you’re about to kill us both, right?!”

Shouta tightened the bindings around Hawks, his glowing red eyes remaining unblinking as the streets grew closer and closer, “Not today…”

A streak of green and violet light suddenly shot past the adults as they reached the height of the skyscrapers, with Kyouka’s jacks grabbing onto Aizawa, dragging him away at blinding speeds.

Izuku and Kyouka held onto each other as they soared between the buildings, the former at a painful 25% and the latter at an agonizing 10%, Izuku’s excess power pulsing behind them and propelling them forward at even faster speeds.

Kyouka slid to a stop across another rooftop, with their teacher tumbling to the side as wind from their flight path rushed past them, and Izuku still in the air. Kyouka extended her jacks out as far as she could, focusing as much of One For All as Izuku was allowing her into only her jacks.

As Hawks fell through the air, still wrapped up in Aizawa’s binding, Izuku grabbed onto each jack, feeling them surge with power as they reached the limit of their length. 

“NOW KYOUKA!!!” With 25% of One For All flowing through her jacks, just like when they were training before the License Exams Kyouka prepared for the pain as she whipped Izuku forwards, the crack echoing across the city. *“FAUX HARMONIC 50%!!!”* 

*“Manchester!!!”* Izuku pierced the dark Musutafu night, his light emanating throughout the city street as he streaked through the air as a bolt of light, a 25% kick slamming right into the base of Hawks’ wings. *“SMAAAASH!!!”*

The assassin bellowed out in pain as his wings were severed from his back, tumbling uncontrollably through the air from the force of the impact. He suddenly was yanked to the side, being grabbed by Izuku as he ran across the sides of buildings back towards the others. With one final burst of energy behind him, Izuku landed on the rooftop with Kyouka and Aizawa. He laid Hawks down before them, moving to tend to Kyouka’s injuries.

Keigo groaned as used his head to push himself up onto his knees, trying to stave off the aching in his back, “Well, that’s four days down the drain for those to grow back.”

“It’ll give you plenty of time to think.” Shouta kicked down on Hawks’ head, rendering him unconscious and crumpling the ground. He sighed deeply, turning to his two students, “Have I ever told you two how utterly terrified I am now that you both have powers?”

Kyouka nodded as Izuku held her bruised and bleeding jacks, “Forty-seven times.”

“Sounds about right. 

From above, Pixie Bob landed down on the rooftop, the gravel spiraling up to carry her and soften her landing. She clawed her hands up, shifting the concrete around Hawks to encase his body, only leaving his head not covered. “Well, that was one way to spend a Sunday. What are we gonna do with him?”

Aizawa sighed as he rewrapped his scarf, “We should keep this close to the chest for now. All Might’s mentioned he has a detective friend, we’ll get in contact with him. Nezu should know a bit more about the politics angle of all this. We’ll keep him on lockdown at UA for now.”

Pixie Bob peered at him, “You wanna keep him at a school?”

“His wings won’t grow back for a few days,” Izuku said, looking down at the unconscious Pro. “So, he should be mostly harmless for now. Besides, if we can beat him, then a school full of Pros will too.”

Aizawa nodded, “He’s right. Besides, it’s been years since we’ve had to use our holding cells. Might as well get some usage out of them.”

Pixie Bob peered at him again, this time with concern, “You guys have *holding cells?”*

“We run a school full of kids with dangerous abilities. We need places that can contain people like that in case of emergencies. At least until proper authorities can arrive and take them away. We’ll need to set up hospital beds in there though, for him and Nagant…Who I am now remembering was just whisked away in a portal.”

“Hold on,” Kyouka grunted, wincing a bit as she raised her jacks up. “Let me see if I can find her…Mm, I think I hear…Uh-oh.”

“What?”

Kyouka turned to Izuku, eyes wide, “We gotta go.”

  
  
  

***~...AMP…~***

  
  
  

**(****Five Minutes Ago: Streets****)**

  
  

Toshinori continued to drive, growling under his breath in frustration, still unable to find his students. The rain pelting against the windshield wasn’t helping. He had thankfully gotten word that Hisashi had made it to Inko, and they were taking his truck to UA until this was over.

Something ahead caught Toshinori’s eyes; a flash of cyan light clashing against the dark clouds and zooming up the side of a building down the street. 

He sped up, swerving around a couple other cars and continuing his journey until he reached the building, which was placed just as the road curved off. He parked on the side of the road, jumping out and running towards the front doors.

He ran through the gray brick plaza, reaching the row of glass doors. As expected, the doors were locked. Sighing to himself, he raised his foot up, ready to kick through the glass when…

*\*CLANG\**

The harsh sound of metal hitting the pavement reverberated throughout the plaza. Toshinori turned around, his main fear being something hit Aizawa’s car and he would kill him for it. But, he found nothing out of the ordinary, until just to his right and across the street. 

There, Tomura Shigarki stood.

He was standing behind two tall, metal doors fallen to the ground, the hinges completely disintegrated off. Toshinori took in the whole building, finding it designed to be more of a classical Japanese style. Beige walls with crimson accents and dark, thatched roofs stacking about three-stories high; a kabuki theater. 

Tomura slowly raised his hand up, a single finger beckoning All Might forth.

For a moment, Toshinori thought about simply ignoring him. But, not only could Kaina handle herself, he had the utmost faith in his students. They’d be fine. 

This conversation with Shigaraki was long overdue…

He watched as Tomura turned around, disappearing into the darkness, knowing Toshinori would follow. 

Taking a deep breath, Toshinori walked across the plaza and across the street, entering the theater with no hesitation. Once in the front lobby, he could see that Tomura was nowhere to be found. But, just past the ticket booths he could see the double doors to the main stage were just barely cracked open, light peeking through. 

He made his way to the door, his footsteps being the only noise in the entire building. Opening the door, he found himself in the main room. Ten rows of sectioned-off, cushioned benches lined the room, all leading to the stage at the front. There were posters of past shows hanging up top, the bright colors standing out against the beige and wood paneling. 

Toshinori stepped further in, still seeing no sign of Tomura. Just as he was wondering if he was backstage, a portal ripped open on the stage. 

Kaina fell through the portal, tumbling to her knees, her rifle still extended out of her arm. She swung around, expecting to find Tomura, but he was nowhere to be found. She growled, looking around for him. “What the fuck was that, kid?! Why would you…?”

Kaina’s eyes finally landed on Toshinori as he stood in the center of the room, just as stunned as she was. She was completely frozen, not sure what to do. They both were in shock, neither making the first move, nor knowing what to say. 

Her heartbeat in her ears, Kaina eventually opened her mouth, but nothing came out. What was she supposed to say? What *could* she say?  

But, then Tomura’s hand suddenly shot through the portal, instantly latching around her neck and pushing her to the knees, a pinkie just barely raised above her skin. 

“Well, isn’t this something?” Tomura cackled as he stepped through, squeezing Kaina’s neck just tightly enough to where it hurt, but she could still breath, albeit with difficulty. “Don’t move, Ms. Nagant. You can take a guess what happens if you do. Even if you can kill me, your neck will be nothing but a dusty stump.”

“You’ve gotta be fucking kidding me,” Kaina wheezed out. “This? This was what it was all about?”

“You think so little of me? No, of course not. You’ve been very helpful…Buuut, I guess in the grand scheme of things everything else was more of a bonus.”

Toshinori took a shaky breath, ripping his eyes away from the hand around Kaina’s neck, looking Tomura in the eyes. “...Tomura Shigaraki.”

“Toshinori Yagi,” Tomura replied. While he couldn’t see it, Toshinori could tell he was smiling. “Been a while. You know, believe it or not, I had no idea this theater was here. I just saw it while following you and couldn’t miss out on the opportunity.”

“My students told me you were one for dramatics.”

“Ha! Yeah, sorry. I guess the poison apple doesn’t fall far from the dead tree. But, I guess if my master taught me anything, it’s that what’s the point in doing anything if it’s not entertaining? I’m sure that’s not the only thing they told you about me that night, though.”

“...No, it wasn’t.”

“Mhm. I’m sure you’re wondering wh-”

“I’m so sorry.”

“...” Tomura blinked a couple times, his brow knitting together. “Excuse me?”

“You never should’ve gotten into All For One’s hands. I should’ve gone looking for your father, no matter what Nana said. Dying wishes can be wrong, even if they had good intentions. She was broken, and Torino…Well, just trust me when I say he would’ve been against it. But, I should’ve known better. I was so obsessed with finding All For One, I…I am at least partially to blame for this. I’m not innocent.”

“...Well, at least you recognize that. But, you’re not gonna beg for her life or anything? Kinda wanted to see that. That was the whole point, you know? I get the HPSC off my back, and I get to watch you suffer as she crumbles away before your eyes. Nothing?”

“No,” Toshinori shook his head. “Your master should’ve told you I’m not the begging type. More of the saving type. Both her…and you.”

“Oh for the love of-”

“...What happened to Kotaro? How did this all start? I know he’s gone, but All For One wouldn’t tell me how it happened. He claimed he didn’t kill him.”

“And, you can’t be sure if he was lying or not. Yeah, I get it. I wouldn’t believe him either. But, for once, he wasn’t lying.” Tomura slowly reached up and tapped the hand on his face, “You’re talkin’ to him.”

“I-...What?”

“Mm, not the family reunion you were expecting, was it?”

Toshinori gazed at the hand on Tomura’s face, peering at the dead skin flaking off of it. The pale, almost white flesh seemed frozen in time, stuck in a state of…

Decay…

Toshinori let out a shaky breath, not wanting to believe the answer, hoping and praying that he was wrong. “...It was you. You killed him.”

“Mhmhm. You know, after Kamino and now this? I understand my master’s obsession with dramatic reveals.” 

“But-...B-But…”

“Why?” Tomura asked for him, finally getting to the part he had been wanting to get to. “Well, let’s start with the simple fact that...He *hated* you.”

“Wh-...What?”

“You came into his life and replaced him. You took all of his mother’s time. You came into his life, and his father died. He was abandoned, but she kept *you,”* Tomura spat out, his voice shaky from bubbling anger as it all ran through his mind. He started to dramatically pace back and forth, Kaina forced to crawl along with him so his fingers didn’t slip. “Then, my father had to spend years with your face plastered across every surface in Japan. Years and years of building bitterness and hatred, culminating in the cold heart of a prick with mommy issues and rejection of any form of hero worship, beating his kids for the sheer idea of liking a hero. Especially *you.*”

Toshinori shut his eyes, taking a deep breath and exhaling slowly, an inescapable feeling of nausea setting in. “Kotaro…”

“One day…I’ll spare you the boring details, but something in me just snapped, I guess. I found a picture of all of you together, and he didn’t like that. You can take a guess as to what he did next. One thing led to another, I was at the age where my quirk would appear at any moment. The universe decided that day was prudent.” Tomura stopped, his hand tightening around Kaina’s neck as her side continued to drip blood onto the stage, his footsteps red and sticky. He pressed his tongue against the back of his teeth as the screams echoed around in his memory. “First it was my dog, Mon…I loved that dog. He was my only comfort through the worst days. My sister always tried, but there was only so much she could do. She was next. She found the remains of Mon, started to scream. I was so confused, and…I grabbed her, afraid I’d get in trouble. Everyone else came out after. My sister, my mother, my grandmother, my asshole father…Nothing but dust in the wind and chunks of flesh in my hands.”

Toshinori stepped a little closer, shaking his head, “You never meant to hurt them.”

“No…But, I think when it came to my dad there was…I dunno. Deep down, there was some form of satisfaction seeing him in pain for once.”

“...He was always in pain. He did all of those horrible things, because he was in pain.”

“Because of you…” Tomura turned his head, staring back at Toshinori. “Every time I see your face, all I see is *him*. Everything, all of it…It just leads back to you. None of it would’ve happened if you never came along.”

“But, All For One-”

“All For Fucking One,” Tomura groaned, rolling his eyes. “Oh, trust me. I’m fully aware of the role he played in all this. Counterpoint: Without you interfering in their lives, All For One would’ve won a long time ago, I’d have never been born. A far more preferable outcome. So, I still choose to blame you. Even after you’ve retired, I can’t escape you. It’s like you’re in every trace of what I see. Even when you’ve lost your powers, everyone thinks you’re invincible, infallible…You’ve made a world that worships you and everything your kind does, even when they don’t deserve jack shit. Your number one worshiper can’t even see how the world hates people like him, or how he used to be, because the bar of human worth is based on the standard you set. Their greatest hero left his own adopted brother to the wolves. Never came to find him. Never came to save him, and look what he created. The one who saved me was All For One. How sad of a fucking sentence is that?”

“Incredibly,” Toshinori nodded. “But…You’ve proven how naive you still truly are.”

Tomura’s brow furrowed, nodding down to Kaina who was definitely starting to look worse for wear, “You think now’s a good time to insult me?”

“It wasn’t an insult. It was a fact. I didn’t make the world this way. Quirks and heroes were around long before me. Sure, I magnified things. I’m fully aware of my influence, and I’d be a liar if I denied that in any way. But, do you even know why Nana took me in? Did Kotaro ever tell you why I was asked to join your family? My own parents gave me away. I was thrown away like garbage, because I was born quirkless. If that doesn’t sound like a hero and quirk-obsessed society, then I don’t know what to tell you.”

“...Your parents abandoned you?”

“Mm. All For One never told you that either? I guess any form of sympathy points would be detrimental to him. I hated them for a while, of course I did. Many years. But, sitting there and festering in my own hatred would’ve gotten me nowhere. I didn’t sit there and point fingers, blaming others for how my life turned out. How my life was gonna turn out was my choice. I never should’ve let Nana take Kotaro to child services. I didn’t know what her plan was, but I knew something was wrong. But, I am not to blame for how he decided to live the rest of his life. I’m not to blame for the man he chose to be. You don’t have to be the man Kotaro created, and you sure as hell don’t have to be the man All For One created. Young Tomura…Let her go. Don’t live fueled by hate like them. If you truly believe it will put your soul to rest, then kill me.”

Tomura groaned, his pinkie just barely grazing over Kaina’s neck, “…Let me guess. It’s you I want, not her.”

“No. If you’re going to kill me, then do it for the right reason. Not so you can satiate the feelings of two dead men. Do it…because killing her won’t stop me.”

“...What?”

If you kill Kaina, I’ll be in unimaginable pain…but, it won’t stop me. I was given away as a child, it didn’t stop me. I lost the only family I had, it didn’t stop me. I lost Kaina once before, it didn’t stop me. I lost my stomach, it didn’t stop me. I lost my quirk, it didn’t stop me. I’m retired, and look where I am right now. It. Didn’t. Stop me. *Nothing* will ever stop me. The only way you could come close to stopping me is killing me, but…even then? It would be disingenuous of me to deny the impact I’ve had on this world. My death would probably just make things worse for you. My influence runs deep through the veins of humanity, all cultivating in the young couple fighting nearby. You think Kaina’s death will stop them? You think my death will stop them? And, most of all? Killing Kaina won’t stop me from thinking of you as my nephew. Killing Kaina won’t stop me from trying to reach out to you, take you back from All For One’s clutches. I’ve been through unimaginable pain in my life…but, I didn’t let it stop me. I never will. In the end, killing her is entirely pointless for you.”

“...” Tomura looked down, a memory flashing back through his mind. He remembered something Midoriya had told him back at the mall; a comment he had simply shrugged off at the time. 

  
  

*~“...All Might has more pain inside than you’d think. Why hate him then?”~*

Toshinori very slowly and carefully stepped up onto the stage, he and Tomura now only a few meters apart. Tomura became uncharacteristically defensive, taking a half-step back, almost as if he was afraid of him. 

“...I can’t fix everything. You probably don’t want me to. I can’t change what I did or didn’t do, and I can’t change what Kotaro did. But…I can try to help now, in whatever way you deem fit. Do whatever you’ve gotta do, but don’t do it because of All For One, or your father, or of me. For once in your life, listen to yourself…What do you want? What do you *really* want?”

Tomura continued to stare at All Might, suddenly hyper-aware of the hands on his face and arms. They felt like they were suddenly squeezing too tight, yet…oddly comforting. 

Tomura squeezed Kaina’s neck tighter, and…

“...I don’t know.”

…He let go.

Kaina’s eyes widened as Tomura shoved her forward, her brow furrowing as she put her hand around her neck, taking deep breaths as she was finally able to breath properly. Tomura snapped his fingers, a black vortex opening up behind him. He quickly stepped backwards into it, the portal closing. 

And, just like that, he was gone.

“Fucking asshole,” Kaina cursed under her breath as the portal vanished entirely. She sat up on her knees, tentatively turning back to look at Toshinori.

All she could do was stare, mouth agape, heart pounding in her ears as the man she wanted so badly to see for years stood before her. She remembered when her visitation rights were secretly revoked by the HPSC, but she knew every time Toshi had come to see her. Even if she could talk to him, she knew she never had the guts to face him again, to face him again after what she had done.

But, the universe apparently was sick of her meandering. 

Toshinori slowly walked up to her, stopping only a couple steps away. Kaina looked up at her old friend; her *best friend.* Even after seeing the news reports, she couldn’t believe how different he looked. But, despite his thin appearance, it was no doubt Toshi. Those tufts of unruly blonde hair, the softness behind those piercing blue eyes was still there…

What was she supposed to say? She couldn’t think of a damn thing. Maybe it was the sheer amount of blood she was still losing, but what were you supposed to say in a situation like theirs?

The only thing she could think of was…

“T-...Toshi…I’m so sorr-”

She couldn’t finish, too shocked by the arms wrapping tightly around her body. She felt her cheek press against his chest, and she couldn’t deny that she practically melted into it. 

“I missed you…”

…That was it. That was all she needed to hear. Her decision was made, if she even really had one. No longer caring about her wound, she stopped holding her side to hug him back.

After all that time, she finally cried. She cried about it all; every single second. 

*\*CRASH!!!\**

The doors behind them suddenly blew open, flying up and crashing into the benches as Izuku and Kyouka appeared, with the former yelling, “All Might, we-...! Uh…” 

Neither Toshinori or Kaina moved, or even reacted to what had happened. Kyouka just took Izuku’s arm and turned him around, walking out of the room. 

In combination with the exhaustion and blood loss, Kaina cried until consciousness slipped away, everything going dark.

  
  
  

***~...AMP…~***

  
  
  
  

**(****The Next Morning: UA: Recovery Girl’s Office****)**

  
  

Kaina forced her eyes open, the heart monitor beeping reaching her ears. She tried to blink the blurriness away from her eyes, not helped by the fluorescent lights above, and lick away the dryness of her lips. How long had she been out this time? 

She tried to yawn, but a cough escaped instead, followed by many others. Kaina prayed that the nurse had left water on her bedside table as she blindly reached her hand out, patting around the table.

But, suddenly a cup was placed into her hand. A warm, calloused hand guided it to her lips. She sipped gratefully, her throat relieving her of the coughing fit. She downed it all, sighing as she rested back against the pillow.

She looked over to thank who she assumed was another nurse, “Thank yo-...”

Kaina’s eyes widened, her voice failing her as she gazed at Toshinori Yagi. 

Falling back into his seat, Toshinori nodded, “Don’t mention it.”

Silence filled the room after that, all except for the continuous beating of the heart monitor. Which, and Kaina would forever deny it, began to beep faster. For what felt like an eternity, they simply sat in each other’s company. 

What was she supposed to say, exactly?

Sorry that I vanished? Sorry, I murdered a man and was taken away with zero explanation? Sorry, did I say a man? I meant multiple people. Sorry that I wasn’t a better friend? Sorry that we never even bothered to entertain the idea of more? Sorry that I-

“...I’m so sorry.”

Kaina’s train of thought was cut off, looking over at Toshinori, “...What?”

Toshinori shook his head, his gaze down at his lap, “I saw it. I saw how distressed you were becoming. Every day that I saw you, you just looked worse and worse. But, I…I was so God-damn focused on my work, the same work that was killing you. I was obsessed with my mission. So obsessed that I couldn’t even find the time to help my best friend, and then she ended up working with the group formed by the man I was so determined to find. A hero who can’t even help those nearest to them, is hardly a hero at all.”

Kaina scoffed, “You? Not a hero? Toshinori, I’ve heard you spout a lot of bullshit to paparazzi and talk show hosts, and that is by far the dumbest thing you’ve ever said. Actually, nevermind. The dumbest thing you’ve ever said is saying you’re sorry to me. How exactly are you at fault in the slightest? You and I both know that even if you confronted me, I wouldn’t have said anything.”

All Might shrugged, “We could have taken them. What could they even do if their golden boy showed up on their doorstep, putting them under arrest for countless murders?”

Kaina shook her head, looking away from him, “Shut up, Toshi. The world needed you. Involving yourself in that would be a bad idea.”

“No, *you* needed me. Somebody. Anybody.” 

“...Hmhm…Hmhmhm! Hehehehehe! God, it hurts to laugh, hehehe!” Kaina covered her eyes, clutching her pained ribs, “How? How do you always do this? How the hell do you always put the blame on yourself?”

Toshinori cracked a smile, “Comes with the job.”

Kaina’s laughter died down as she sighed, staring up at the ceiling, “Why are you here, Toshinori? An explanation? I snapped. That’s all I got for you. I…I couldn’t take it. I don’t have your impenetrable heart, I never did. It reached the point where putting on my costume made me feel like there was poison in my veins. Some people, after so much death, simply become accustomed to it. They feel nothing towards it. I reacted the opposite. Every kill just made me puke, lose sleep until I would eventually cry myself out, not eat...Started treating you like shit. God-damn it, I’m so sorry. For *everything*.”

She felt his hand grasp hers again, looking over to see him nod solemnly, “I know.”

“...I’m gonna make it up to you. And, I don’t know what the deal with them is, but I owe those two kids a whole lot too.”

“I already owe them too much myself,” Toshinori scoffed, “And they’re such good kids that the debt you feel towards them gains interest over time.”

Kaina giggled, “They fought a Pro only as a couple of students. I can see why you like them so much.”

“I am not to blame for their insanity, but I am an enabler.”

“Hahaha! Sounds about right. They said they were family to you. You didn’t go around adopting kids, did you?”

“Hmhm, no. Young Izuku found me at my lowest. As you can see, my fight with All For One didn’t go as planned. You were gone, my hero days were numbered, I was alone, and I felt like more of a failure and a fraud as the days went by. Young Izuku brought me back to my old self in only a matter of hours.”

“And the girl?”

“Pfft, where do I even begin with Young Kyouka? Smartmouth, bark and bite, heart of a hero, and light of Young Izuku’s life that somehow wedged her way into our lives. Don’t ask about her powers though, that’s uh…That’s an explanation we’ll save for later.”

“That’s…ominous. What about your powers? What was all that shit about losing your quirk?”

“...Same explanation.”

“Oh boy.”

“Let’s just save it until you’ve gotten more rest.”

“You should get some rest, too. You look like shit.”

Toshinori rubbed his eyes, a smirk on his lips, “I’ve looked like shit for six years, but you’re still not wrong.”

“Excuse me? Skinnier or not, you’re still one hell of a handsome lady-killer.”

Toshinori cleared his throat, ignoring the warmth in his cheeks, “I’m pretty sure that title belongs to you.”

“...”

“Too soon?”

“Mhmhmhm…Nah.”

Toshinori chuckled with her, looking her over again. “...I like your hair. I know Tartarus probably made you cut it because of your quirk and all, but still. Looks good.”

“Thank you. I cut it to look like yours.”

“Hm? I-...” Toshinori looked at it again, his brows raising. Unruly locks in the back, and a face framed by two long bangs. “Huh…Cool.”

“For the love of all that’s holy, Toshinori…” Kaina looked over at the door, finding Recovery Girl walking in with a grocery bag. “He means that he really likes it.”

Toshinori cleared his throat, turning away to hide the blush on his cheeks, “Yeah, that.”

“Hey, Chiyo,” Kaina smiled a little sheepishly at Recovery Girl. “Been a few years…Sorry I-”

“Bah, enough of the apologizing.” She walked up to the bed, setting down the bag she was carrying near Kaina’s hip. Reaching into the bag, she pulled out caramel-filled dark chocolate squares and handed them to Kaina. “You don’t need to explain anything to me. It’s just good to see you again.”

“You too,” She grinned back, taking the chocolate.

Chiyo took Kaina’s hand and kissed her knuckles. Kaina instantly felt her eyelids grow head, but the aches and pains all quickly subsided. 

“Oooh yeah, that’s the good stuff,” Kaina chuckled as she sank back down into the pillows, popping some candy in her mouth. “By the way, um…Am I going back to prison?”

“No,” Toshinori shook his head. “Not if I have anything to say about it.”

“You know it’s not that simple, Toshinori.” Everyone turned back to the door again, finding Gran Torino standing in the doorway. He made his way towards them, his cane clicking against the ground. “With all of this junk you’ve dumped in our laps, there’s a lot to sort through.”

Kaina grimaced, “Oh please don’t tell me Nighteye is about to walk through that door.”

Torino chuckled as he made it to the bed, “No, just me. You assume he’d even show up for you.”

“Fair point. It’s good to see you again, old man.”

“Mm, and just when I thought I had enough people in my life causing me trouble. Speaking of which…” Torino shoved his cane in Toshinori’s face, glare burning a hole through his head. “Would you care to explain to me why you didn’t tell me about *any* of this? You thought it was a better idea to involve the boy’s father before even bothering to tell me you were going against the government?”

Toshinori looked down at the cane as it pressed against his nose, “...Yeah, I’m not gonna lie to you. That’s not the only thing I haven’t told you about, and you’re probably gonna be angrier about that than you are this.”

“The hell’s that mean?”

“Uh…Ask the resident couple.”

“Oh for the love of…Now I don’t even wanna know.” Torino turned back to Nagant, nudging her leg with his cane. “Tsukauchi and his squad made it to your apartment. They’ve got your laptop, and they’ve already made multiple back-ups of all the footage.”

“Good…Good…” Kaina took a deep breath as it grew harder to stay awake. “Where’s Hawks?”

“Holding cell here at UA,” Toshinori answered. “Tsukauchi’s got people watching over Madam President and the rest of the HPSC board. Apparently, she was too prideful to go into hiding. He’s probably gonna want to come in and talk to you before any arrests are made. It’ll be even longer before there’s any sort of trial. They’ll have to do an investigation into everything the HPSC’s got. But, don’t worry about that right now. Just rest, and know that you won.”

“...I won,” Kaina said to herself, almost as if to reaffirm it, no longer able to keep her eyes open. “...I won.”

Toshinori sighed, nodding towards the door. He and Torino left the room, making it out into the hallway and shutting the door behind them. “...I can’t believe she’s back.”

“You say that as if she died,” Torino said, beginning to walk down the hall.

“She might as well have,” Toshinori shrugged his shoulders as he followed him. “They tried to wipe any evidence of her off the Earth.”

“Yes, but…it’s over now. At least, that chapter of all this is. When she’s ready, we’ll have to ask her about the League as well. I…I heard you spoke to him.”

They reached the elevator, and Toshinori just sighed deeply as he ran his hands down his face. “It just gets worse. So, so much worse. I’ll explain everything once we’re with Young Izuku and Kyouka. But, I will say that I think…I think all hope isn’t lost. Tomura he seems…I don’t know. Young Izuku was right. There’s something in him; something that All For One was never able to rip out of him or change. I think he can be saved…In some capacity, at least.”

“Mm…Let’s hope so.”

  
  

***~...AMP…~***

  
  
  

**(****Five Minutes Later: Principal Nezu’s Office****)**

  
  

Toshinori and Torino stepped into Nezu’s office, finding everyone there, even the Jirous. Both mothers had completely latched onto the children, along with Kyoutoku completely forgoing any tough guy act and trying to hug them all at once. The couple was bandaged up and mostly healed by Recovery Girl already. 

On the projection screen on the right of Nezu’s office was security footage of Hawks in his holding cell, staring up at the ceiling, clearly unamused. 

Hisashi was standing next to one of the sofas. Toshinori would see him curiously glancing at Kyouka from time-to-time, still clearly confused by what he witnessed last night. Aizawa was on the sofa, head back as he dozed off, his sleep schedule completely messed up. 

“Hey,” Toshinori turned his head, finding Ryuko walking up next to him, arms crossed over her stomach. “So, uh…Is she alright?”

 “Yeah, yeah. She’s worn out from Recovery Girl’s quirk, but she’s gonna be fine. Just waiting for this all to unfold now, like the rest of us.”

Ryuko nodded as Torino walked up to the couple and smacked both of their legs with his cane, “So, Toshinori tells me that you two have something to tell me. Something I should’ve known a long time ago.”

The couple just looked at one another, both nodding their heads at Torino, expressions changing by the second as they seemed to have a completely silent conversation. Izuku eventually cleared his throat, nodding towards both his father and Ryuko, “It’s a little hard to have this conversation right now.”

“Oh, that just makes me even more worried.”

“Okay,” Toshinori cut in, hand on his mentor’s shoulder, “We all have a million different explanations to give, but let’s just focus on the more general importance right now. Where exactly do we go from here?”

“Court?” Kyouka shrugged.

“Not exactly,” Nezu chimed in, hopping up on the back of the couch, same smile ever-present on his face. “After arrests are made, we’ll have to wait for a trial. It will take a long time for the authorities to fully investigate the HPSC.”

“We’ll need to make sure the footage is kept under wraps,” Aizawa said, making Hisashi jump in surprise as he didn’t realize the teacher had awoken. He looked at All Might, a brow raised, “Your detective friend…How’s he feel about making some edits to the video?”

“Already taken care of,” Toshinori nodded. “He had no idea what he was looking at, but I told him everything that had to do with the actual fight didn’t matter and could be cut. Just the initial conversation between Hawks and Kaina was needed.”

Ryuko furrowed her brow, peering around the room, “Uh…Why, exactly?”

Everyone who knew didn’t say anything, or make any glances. It wasn’t up to them. But, Izuku and Kyouka looked at one another, having another silent conversation. Kyouka eventually decided to just keep it vague. They could definitely say the trusted Pixie Bob, especially at this point. But, it still wasn’t a secret they could throw around without a longer conversation. 

“Let’s just say it would be better if I wasn't on camera.”

Ryuko was clearly still confused, but seemed to decide not to pry for the time-being. Izuku took a quick glance at his father, and he recognized the look of deep thought all too well. He had seen it in the mirror more times than he could count. He was piecing things together.

“What are things gonna look like moving forward?” Kyoutoku asked, curiosity getting the better of him. “I mean, you guys are about to upheave an entire branch of government.”

“Not upheave. Clean up,” Toshinori corrected him, pocketing his hands. “The entire board will be gone. Pretty much every person that was supposed to take the President’s place in emergencies like this is gonna be out, and every department head will be out of commission until they’ve been thoroughly investigated to make sure they weren’t in on it.”

“Government funding will be frozen,” Nezu nodded, pacing along the back of the couch. “New agencies can’t be made, nor new licenses. There will be no official rankings updates, and heroes without agencies can’t be paid. All of these things are completely halted until those sections of the HPSC can get back up and running again.”

Torino rested both hands on his cane as he sighed, “Someone’s gonna have to step-in to not just make sure the investigation goes smoothly from an internal standpoint, but also to take over as they try to get everything working again. Heroes still need to get paid, agencies will need steady income, insurance and financial aid for the regular employees, and that’s even if they keep their jobs. There are plenty of innocent workers that will be out of a job unless we can get a good replacement. There’s never been an investigation this big, but we can’t just have an entire government branch gone for that long. Heroes are a huge part of our society, our economy…”

“...I’ll do it.” All eyes turned to Hisashi. He cleared his throat, wringing his hands together. “I’ve worked for the HPSC for twenty years, I know the ins and outs of every aspect of it…except for the corrupt parts, but I guess that’s what makes me even more qualified. I’m technically the only high-ranking representative that can be instantly cleared of any involvement with their dealings whatsoever. While unofficial until now, I was the lead investigator and I’ve gone through tons of corruption cases, so I can point the other investigators in the right direction. I understand the importance of heroes, I’ve been working alongside them all this time. I can make sure the essentials are back as quickly as I can. Especially since we’re forgetting about the other side of this. Villains will see this as an opportunity, and we have to subvert that expectation. The League did this to get the HPSC off of their backs. We’ll need heroes now more than ever, which means making them and their agencies operational.”

Everyone looked around at each other, and nobody could argue it. Even if they knew somebody else that could possibly qualify for the job, they most likely wouldn’t be a better candidate than Hisashi. 

Toshinori walked up to him, brow raised, “The role of HPSC President seems to be cursed. You sure you wanna do this?”

“Someone has to. It’ll be hard for the people to trust anybody in that position again. But, I’m sorry to admit it…Being backed by All Might would definitely help.”

“Seeing as you were my partner in all this, I owe you far more than a political backing. It’ll be a lot of work, but I don’t think there’s anybody better for this job…Mr. President.”

“...Uh-oh, the pressure’s already setting in.”

“Too late!” Nezu cheered. “Once there are arrests, I’ll set up a press conference for the announcement.  Mr and Mrs. Midoriya, I’ve already sent over some workers to fix the damages done to your home. I can assure you they work very fast, but until then I’ve provided you with one of the empty teacher’s homes. Now, I suggest everyone follow Aizawa’s example and get some rest.”

Everyone turned to Aizawa, finding he had fallen back asleep again on the couch. Hisashi and Inko took their key, and everyone began to file out of Nezu’s office, leaving Aizawa behind. There was no way anybody was gonna dare wake him up at that point. Once in the hall, Toshinori turned to his two students.

 “You two are exempt from classes today. Midnight can take over for homeroom, and my class will just be a free training day. You haven’t slept all night. We’ll reconvene tomorrow.” Toshinori leaned down, a hand on one of each of their shoulders. “You’ll never understand how proud I am, and…Thank you. None of this would’ve happened without you.”

“Hey, we get to hear that in a good context this time,” Kyouka smiled. 

Toshinori rolled his eyes and chuckled, “Go on, get out of here.”

As they turned to leave, Toshinori felt a hand on his arm. He looked down, finding Ryuko looking up at him. “Hey.” 

“Hey,” Toshinori smiled, taking her hands in his. “Don’t think I’ve forgotten about you. I know this was all thrown onto you out of nowhere, but you still came through without question. I owe you so much, and my thanks are only the beginning.”

Ryuko smiled at him, but it was still sort of somber, “Hey, you needed help. It’s my job. Besides, I can now brag to the other Pussycats that I helped expose a corrupt government branch. It’s a whole lot more interesting than mountain rescue.”

“Hmhmhm, I don’t doubt that. But, all the same…Thank you, Ryuko.”

“Always, Toshi. But, um…” Ryuko nodded down the hall, pursing her lips. “...Can we talk?”

“...Uh-oh.” Toshinori shared a glance with Torino, who immediately acted as if he didn’t exist. Toshinori followed Ryuko down the hall, stopping as they reached the big windows looking out over campus as the sun began to peek out over the city. “...I can’t tell if I prefer to just rip the band-aid off or not.”

“I’m breaking up with you.”

“Yep, ripped it right off,” Toshinori sighed, running a hand through his hair. “Ryuko, what I said about my feelings for Kaina in the past, I would never let that interfere with you and me. I really, *really* enjoy being with you, an-”

“I know,” Ryuko smiled, leaning against the window and looking out as the orange sunlight painted the morning sun violet. “I have no doubt about that. You’re too good-hearted to do that to anyone. And, I know you like me. I think if we stayed together, we’d go the distance.”

“...But?”

“But…Toshi, you deserve the world. You’d never agree, but with everything you’ve done for us all, you deserve the best. I’m not saying I couldn’t give you that, but…the woman you love was ripped away from you. Every aspect of your past that I’ve been allowed to know has been nothing but tragedy after tragedy. For once, the universe has given you the chance to take something back. Hell, even in our short time together, you’ve completely reinvigorated my confidence to date. To *actually* date, and not sit around, pine, and wallow. I mean, I landed *you*. Probably the best person ever wanted to date me. Do you know how much of a confidence booster that is?”

Toshinori blushed, sheepishly shrugging, “I’m not the best person…”

“See? And, Toshi, I see the way you look at her. I saw it the whole ride back to UA. You still love that woman. I’m not mad about that, by the way. A *tad* jealous? Sure, but you didn’t think you’d ever see her again. But, now? You can’t let the opportunity slip away again. You spent over a decade with a woman that looks like *that,* and you did *nothing?* I don’t know what kind of discipline you’ve got instilled into you, but you’ve gotta throw it away, baby”

“But…I-...Our time together-”

“Meant the world. Nothing and nobody can take that away. You tried to move on, find the happiness and connection you didn’t have before. But, you had the chance for happiness a long time ago, and you denied yourself.” She stepped closer, taking his chin in her hands. “I’m a big girl. I’ll be just fine. Besides, maybe it’s best to find someone a little closer to your age. That’s rich coming from me, I know. And, you’re still like ten years older.”

“Okay…” Toshinori deadpanned. 

Ryuko chuckled, pulling him down and giving him one last kiss. “Go get her, Tiger. You ever need me again, just call.” 

Toshinori sighed, but he nodded. “Thank you, Ryuko. For everything. For last night, for this, and…You were the first real relationship I’ve ever had. I didn’t think something like that would ever be for me. With the job, my likelihood of death, getting older and…I always preached to Young Izuku that choosing love wasn’t a distraction, but it made you stronger. You made me realize I should start listening to my own advice sometimes.”

“Yes, you should,” Ryuko smiled, turning around to walk away. “See you around, Toshinori.”

“...See you around, Ryuko.”

**(****UA: Front Entrance****)**

  
  

“You’re sure you’re ok?” Inko asked as they all made it out the front doors. 

“We’re fine,” Izuku nodded, turning back to address both sets of parents. “Just tired, is all. Being up this long doesn’t feel so good when combined with Recovery Girl’s quirk.”

Kyouka stretched her shoulders back as she yawned, “We might have to just go to class anyway. If we stay at the dorms, we’re gonna need an excuse for why we weren’t there.”

“Dentist,” Mika instantly offered up. “Easy excuse.”

“I mean, sure, but why would we go together?” Mika simply raised a brow at her, and Kyouka sighed. “Attached at the hip, yada-yada. I get it.”

Izuku chuckled, turning to look at this dad. Hisashi was standing there with the same expression of deep thought from before. But, Izuku had a feeling it wasn’t about Kyouka this time. “Are you okay?”

“Hm?” Hisashi looked up, snapped out of his trance. “O-Oh, yeah. Just been a very strange and packed forty-eight hours, you know?”

Kyoutoku scoffed, clapping Hisashi’s back, “You get used to it around here, buddy.”

Izuku nodded in understanding, sharing a glance with Kyouka before continuing, “I-I know it’s been a lot, and you saw some, uh…hard to explain things. Things that I probably should’ve told you about by now. But, I…After everything you just did All Might, for mom, for me, you deserve to know. I-I just…If things went wrong last night, I-I never would’ve gotten to…” 

Izuku sighed and shook his head, deciding to throw words out the window, and just hug his dad. Hisashi’s eyes widened, frozen out of pure shock. He hadn’t hugged Izuku in years. The one when he came back from America didn’t count, way too awkward. But, this…

Inko eventually stepped in, taking Hisashi’s arms and wrapping them around their son before she hugged her husband as well. Kyouka smiled warmly at the family, looking over at her parents to see Kyoutoku trying to hide his tears.

Things, of course, still weren’t completely fixed. It wouldn’t be for a while, and that was probably a good thing. Stuff like this can’t be rushed. 

But, they had a real, solid foundation. That was more than enough for now.

Izuku pulled out of the hug, clearing his throat, “Just, uh…You know.”

“I get it,” Hisashi nodded, smiling at his son. “Avoiding attempted murder was definitely worth it.”

“Not to mention becoming the new president,” Inko nudged him.

“Acting President, technically. And, about that…” Hisashi took Inko’s hands, looking down at her apologetically. “I’m sorry. The whole point of coming back to Japan was to spend more time with you guys. This is gonna make me very busy, at least for a while.”

Inko shook her head, hand on his cheek, “Don’t worry about that. I’ll happily take being busy while at home over being busy in another country. Besides, government conspiracy or not, you’ve earned this.”

Hisashi took a deep breath and nodded, “I mean, if you want to spend more time together, I could always use the cliché hot secretary.”

  
“True, but honey, we’re trying to avoid any scandals from now on. The secretary sleeping with the boss?”

Izuku grimaced, immediately gagging, “Wh-?! Eugh! No! No! No! Stop that! Not in front of me!”

Kyouka chuckled, her jack wrapping around Izuku’s wrist and walking towards the dorms, “Finally after all this time, I’m not the only one with embarrassing parents.”

**(****Unknown Coordinates: Abandoned Satellite Base****)**

  
  

At the end of the dark halls of the satellite base, light could be seen peeking out from the cracked metal door. 

Most of the League hadn’t woken up quite yet. But, those who had decided to stay in their rooms. Tomura’s growls of anger had echoed well into the night, and they felt it was best to leave him to it. 

Except for one, that is…

A vortex swirled open in Tomura’s room, Kurogiri stepping through. From the moment he entered, he felt dust beneath his feet. Tomura was sitting at his desk, but he wasn’t facing his monitor. He was hunched over, Kotaro’s hand in his own, the rest of his family resting on the floor before him.

Kurogiri looked around the room, noticing that nothing of note seemed to be destroyed. Besides the dust, the room seemed ironically clean.

“I appreciate you taking out your anger on your trash, Young Tomura. It’s far easier to simply use the vacuum.

“...” 

Kurogiri hummed to himself, looking down at the hands on the floor. “...Perhaps it’s not what you want to hear right now, but I am admittedly glad and impressed that you let Ms. Tsutsumi go. Her death was-”

“Pointless,” Tomura finally said, his position not changing. “It was pointless. If I just wanted to kill him anyway, what was the point in killing her? Kinda liked her anyway, so…”

“Mm. She is a woman of determination.”

“Yeah. She’s already done more than me.”

Kurogiri sighed, stepping closer to him. He stopped just before reaching the hands on the ground, “...Young Tomura, you know I have to ask. Why did you let him go?”

Tomura didn’t answer at first. He continued to stare down at Kotaro’s hand, the memories of that night hadn’t stopped playing since he returned. “It was pointless.”

“What do you mean?”

“...All these years I hated him. What’s it ever done? How far has it gotten me? I blamed him for so much because I had nobody else to blame. It was stupid.”

“Mn…And, why the change of heart now?”

“...Let’s just say I was lacking context. I guess just like my master, I underestimated him.” Something deep down was still unnaturally pissed at those words, but it just didn’t have the strength anymore.

His hatred for All Might…It meant nothing anymore.

The person he blamed for hero and quirk society was just another victim of it. Like Midoriya, like his father, like his entire team…

Like him…

“...We’re done with All Might. Forget him. Let’s just move on. We got the HPSC off our backs, and Lady Nagant gets to go with the people she actually wants to be with. It’s a done deal. She’s more than earned that. We can focus on ourselves now.”

If Kurogiri had lips, one might’ve seen him smile just a bit. He nodded, hands behind his back. “Of course. What’s our next step?”

Tomura put the hand back on his face, standing up from his chair. It was time to move forward. To what, he didn’t know. But, he had to find out…eventually.

“Call Giran. Set up that meeting with the Yakuza as soon as they’re available.”
