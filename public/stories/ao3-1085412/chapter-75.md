*24* *th*  *May 1995*

"No, your wrist is too weak here." Hermione reached out and corrected Susan's stance. "Try again."

Sue frowned at her but did as she ordered. The hose spell flew out of her wand in a stream of water into the waiting bucket the room had provided. Sue relaxed and grinned weakly at Hermione. "Thank you."

Hermione smiled and pushed her hair back over her shoulder. "Shall we move onto the next water spell?"

"Sure." Sue agreed. Her eyes glanced across the room to where Harry stood instructing Neville and Ron. "Harry's pretty great keeping these defence classes going." A flicker of worry appeared in her eyes before disappearing again.

Hermione placed a hand on her arm, trying to reassure the other girl. "Don't worry. We're pretty certain that hostages won't be used in the third task."

"It's not that…" Sue sighed. "I'm worried about the real reason for these sessions; that there's still someone walking around pretending to be a student."

"Me too." Hermione answered immediately.

She had been a little horrified herself when the adults had agreed that Ron's supposition was truth, and a Death Eater walked among the student body. Safety measures were in place though; none of the alliance went anywhere alone even in the relative safety of the dormitories (Hermione recalled the first night when she'd escaped to her dorm for solitude and blushed but she hadn't done it since); they all carried emergency alarms, and they were all taking Harry's defence class which doubled as a tournament training session for him. She did wonder if Sirius had rethought allowing Harry in the dorm since Harry hadn't been there since the first night of term, but then given the boys had been hung over the next day maybe that had less to do with Crouch and was just plain old parental caution.

"I think it's only natural everyone is going to worry until we know for certain that they're captured." Hermione stated, realising Sue was waiting for a reply. She made the wand movements for the glacial spell.

"That's what Healer Allen tells me." Sue quipped dryly.

Hermione gave a visible wince and made to apologise but Sue waved her off.

"Ignore me, I'm just…" Sue sighed heavily and tucked a strand of hair back behind one ear. "It's embarrassing you know. Having to see a healer because I flipped out."

"You didn't flip out." Hermione argued quietly. "You were traumatised and fell into a state of heightened anxiety. It could have happened to any of us."

Sue grimaced. "Well, it happened to me. You were fine after the second task and so was Natalie. I was the only one…"

"You were the only one who received hate mail and humiliation at being chosen." Hermione stated firmly. "Besides, Natalie is much older and I'm, well…"

"Used to it?" Sue suggested with a fleeting smile.

"Yes." Hermione replied with a smile of her own. "It's kind of a side effect of being friends with Harry. And honestly, you shouldn't feel embarrassed. Don't forget Harry sees Healer Allen himself."

Harry had continued seeing the Healer weekly since he'd returned from Bulgaria. Hermione often wondered what they spoke about but she wasn't going to ask – his healing sessions were private. She was working on accepting that there were things that Harry couldn't tell her. There was something big about the third task. She and the others knew that there was a risk that Voldemort would try again to sabotage the task; that he'd use it to try to kill Harry but there was something else going on too; something which Harry wasn't talking about.

"Hannah said the same thing." Sue attempted the glacial spell and grinned when she got it first time. Her eyes flickered back to the boys. "I feel guilty about what happened with her and Neville."

Hermione hummed under her breath, tried the spell and gave a satisfied nod when it worked. She sympathised with Sue's feelings of guilt but she sided with Neville. Sue's spiralling anxiety and depression had been bad and made worse by Hannah trying to deal with it on her own instead of confiding in her parents or another adult. It hadn't been until Sirius and the parents of both girls had confronted them on their strange behaviour that the truth had come out. But then…Hannah had been trying to keep Sue's confidence and Hermione couldn't say with certainty that she wouldn't have done the same thing in Hannah's place. She still thought Hannah had treated Neville appallingly.

"She still likes him." Sue said softly, her gaze shifting guiltily to where Hannah was practising spells with Ginny just along from them. "Do you think…?"

"I don't know." Hermione said. Neville hadn't started dating anyone else but he had been close-mouthed about Hannah, especially once the truth about Sue had become known within the alliance.

"Could you…could you maybe tell him? Sound him out?" Sue asked tentatively.

Hermione turned to look at her fully. Sue's eyes held a measure of hope along with trepidation. "I'll let him know she still likes him but I wouldn't get Hannah's hopes up. She hurt him quite badly."

Sue nodded slowly. "Thank you."

Hermione gave her own sharp nod and raised her wand. "Shall we try the fountain spell?"

o-O-o

"Merlin, you are hopeless at water spells." Blaise commented as Draco failed to achieve the hose spell again.

"You're not saying the incantation correctly." Theo pointed out and proceeded to demonstrate the spell with accuracy.

Draco sniffed. "I hardly think Crouch is going to be taken out by a stream of water."

"Not when it's barely a trickle." Theo agreed, gesturing towards Draco's bucket. "But if he gets hit by all of us together?"

"Come on, Draco." Blaise said impatiently. "All the Gryffindors have mastered this already."

Draco lifted his chin, pointed his wand and performed the spell perfectly.

Blaise exchanged a knowing look with Theo that had Draco frowning.

"What was *that* look for?" he demanded.

"You still need to work on that Gryffindor button you have." Theo pointed out bluntly. "Anybody presses it and it works every time."

Draco spluttered angrily and launched into the next spell aiming it directly at Theo who simply shielded before the ice could hit him.

"At the buckets, people!" Harry's voice carried over the length of the room separating them. "Not each other!"

"You know I think he's the best defence teacher we've had." Blaise commented breezily as Draco subsided with a sulky frown.

"Moody is better." Draco rejoined, although secretly he had to admit that Harry had a talent for teaching. "Potter is acceptable and it's only right he's providing us with some form of protection against Crouch."

Theo rolled his eyes and did the glacial spell. "You could have moved into the Black suite of rooms if you were that worried."

"I'm not worried," Draco corrected huffily, ignoring the nerves that fluttered uneasily within his belly at the idea of coming across Crouch on his own, "but the situation here is causing Mother to worry needlessly especially at present."

His mother's burgeoning pregnancy wasn't something he liked to contemplate very often. She was tremendously happy – glowing. He wondered if she'd been the same way when she had been expecting him. The new baby had been confirmed as a girl though which was one worry off Draco's mind.

"At least your mother worries." Blaise commented almost casually.

Draco tilted his head in silent acknowledgement of what Blaise didn't say – that Nora Zabini hadn't so much as sent a letter of support to her son.

"Father thinks it's unlikely that any of us will be targeted by Crouch." Theo offered quietly. "He says Riddle can't afford to lose too many supporters by endangering any of the progeny of his Marked followers and he's likely to leave Slytherins alone completely."

Draco lifted a pale eyebrow. "Perhaps but from everything I've heard he's just as likely to off one of us to make the point that going against him is wrong."

He shifted position, trying to lose some of the tension that had crept into his frame. He had received word from his mother that his father and his allies were considering their position in light of the very real possibility that there was an imminent climax to the Dark Lord's pursuit of Potter. Given the discussions in the Summer, Draco was almost sure his father wasn't going to choose to side with the Dark Lord openly but slyly in order to save his life? Draco could believe his father would do that.

His mother's choice was obvious. She had made her position clear at Easter in her defence of Black Farm. He doubted that the Dark Lord was going to just sweep his mother siding with her sister and niece against the Dark Lord's agent under the rug.

Draco's gaze moved back to Potter. His former nemesis was demonstrating an advanced water spell to Longbottom. The power and skill required to make the spell work were enormous and proved without Potter saying a word just how powerful he was. He thought again of Halloween and his own stand in the Slytherin common room; the decision he'd made in the Summer to take power as part of the House of Black. His spine straightened almost without thought. It was a decision he stood by, he realised. Potter was better than the prospect of living under the thumb of a Dark Lord who would kill at a whim.

"We should be practising cutting and bludgeoning spells." Draco said, remembering how his aunt and cousin had dealt with Alecto Carrow.

Blaise raised both his eyebrows. "Merlin, you Blacks are a bloodthirsty lot."

Draco smiled haughtily. "And don't you forget it."

Theo gave him an approving nod and pointed at the bucket. "You know a thinly directed hose spell with enough pressure will punch a hole through an object."

Blaise grinned. "How about it then, Malfoy? A galleon says you can't do it before the end of the session."

Draco pointed his wand at the bucket. "Prepare to lose your money, Zabini." And considered that perhaps the two of them knew all his buttons far too well.

o-O-o

Ron breathed in deeply and thrust out his wand again. He grinned at the rain of ice that appeared, showering itself mostly into the bucket.

"Good form." Harry grinned at him. "Neville?"

Neville pursed his lips, adjusted his stance and moved. Ice fell into a steady stream straight into the bucket.

"That's great, Nev!" Harry patted his back.

Neville gave a happy smile and turned around to tease Ron but his gaze caught on Hannah and the words died on his tongue. He yanked his eyes away from his former girlfriend and back to the bucket.

Harry's pat turned into a consoling squeeze.

"You know she still likes you, mate." Ron commented, not without sympathy. He twirled his wand around his fingers.

"I still like her." Neville shrugged. It wouldn't change what had happened.

Hannah had been courteous enough to request an audience to explain what had gone on with Sue and Neville had accepted. He'd already heard through a letter from his Gran the main details – Sue's anxiety and Hannah's attempt to help her friend through it despite struggling to deal with Sue's ever spiralling situation. He had even accepted Hannah's apology for her behaviour and told her that he understood why she had acted the way she had. It didn't erase the months of ignoring him in her attempt to deal with Sue, and perhaps if she'd had more faith in him or them, she would have confided in him long before they'd gotten to the point of breaking up.

"You could give her a second chance?" said Ron, breaking into his reminiscing.

Neville was somewhat surprised that it was Ron who had made the sensible suggestion but he shook his head. "That's…"

"It's up to you, mate." Ron said immediately. "Merlin knows I've had enough hassle about breaking up with Lavender. I'm not going to give you grief over Hannah."

"It's not the right time for us to be together." Neville summarised out loud. "She's dealing with the fallout from what happened with Sue and she needs space."

"That sounds remarkably specific." Harry commented, pushing his glasses up his nose and frowning at him.

"Possibly because that's what she said when we talked and *I* suggested it." Neville replied trying and failing to keep a hint of bitterness out of his voice.

Both of his friends visibly winced.

"Sorry, Nev." Harry said quietly. He gave Neville another comforting squeeze.

"Girls, eh?" Ron scratched his chin with the butt of his wand. "Mental."

Neville shrugged again, just wanting to drop the subject. Across the room Blaise sent a questioning look and Neville gave him a short nod, confirming all was fine. Blaise had been a good friend in the wake of the break-up and had even refrained from starting a betting pool on how long it would take the couple to get back together, or for them to find someone else. The last five weeks had seemed like an eternity and yet at the same time as though they'd disappeared in a blink of an eye.

"You want to try that split water spell again?" Neville motioned at Harry who nodded.

"Why are we focusing on these water spells again?" There was a touch of a whine in Ron's voice.

"Because the research group found out that in at least ten of the tournaments elemental obstacles had been used to challenge the champions?" Harry responded briskly.

"Rather you than me, mate." Ron commented.

Neville sent Harry a sympathetic glance and Harry acknowledged it with a small smile.

"Are you planning to try staying over again in the dorm now Blakely's been cleared?" asked Neville, changing the subject again for Harry's benefit. He wasn't sure whether the presence of a Gryffindor suspect had altered Sirius's decision to allow Harry time in the dorm but it seemed evident in the fact that Harry hadn't stayed over since the first night.

Casper Blakely, though, had ended up spending over two days in the infirmary after one of the Beauxbatons' horses had kicked him and that had proven he was himself. Hardly any other progress had been made in finding Crouch as, according to his Gran, every time they thought Crouch would make an attempt to leave, all the suspects had had classes making it impossible for them to go without blowing their cover and so no-one had.

Ron's face brightened with anticipation. "You should come over this weekend! Seamus has another bottle of whiskey. We can have a party and…"

"Can't have alcohol, remember?" Harry poked his first friend in the side.

Ron's face fell. "Right."

Frankly, Neville wished he had the excuse of not being able to drink alcohol. He hadn't enjoyed waking up the next morning the last time, his mouth dry and furry, his head pounding and his stomach churning. He had silently decided that he'd stick to butter beer until he was of an age to drink alcohol. His peers were clearly not thinking the same thing. Neville pressed his lips together; he could say he was supporting Harry's abstinence and that would probably get him out of having to participate.

He pointed his wand at the bucket and tried the fountain spell, frowning when it didn't work. Harry corrected his wand movements.

"Maybe I'll try and sleep over one night this weekend." Harry offered. "If Sirius agrees."

Ron beamed and Neville couldn't help feeling a flare of satisfaction at the idea of having Harry back in the dorm.

"It would be good to have you back." Neville commented out loud.

"No," Ron slung a friendly arm over Harry's shoulder, "it will be *great* to have you back!"

o-O-o

Harry walked beside Bill on his way back to his and Sirius's rooms without complaint about the escort. Bill kept an easy pace as though he was aware Harry wanted to use the time to think.

The practice session had gone well; most everyone had managed the hose spell and the glacial. The fountain took quite a bit of power and only the oldest or determined (such as Hermione) had succeeded at first go.

Harry yawned and covered his mouth with his hand. He was tired. Since his return to Hogwarts it felt like every spare moment had been spent planning or training for the third task and what lay beyond it. Maybe it would be good to have a night off in the Gryffindor dorm and just sit around playing chess with Ron or providing an ear for Neville.

"You need a good night's sleep." Bill commented as they entered the corridor that led to Harry's quarters with Sirius.

Harry nodded. "Practice was tiring."

"You need to pace yourself." Bill advised. "You've got a lot of magical power but if you keep pushing yourself you'll end up in Poppy's care with exhaustion."

Harry grimaced but didn't refute it.

The door opened at the password and Harry entered with Bill just behind him. Harry spotted their visitor and stilled.

Snape rose from his seat in the armchair. "I shall take my leave."

Sirius didn't move from his place stood in front of the slumbering fire, leaning on the mantel. He raised his cup in acknowledgement. "Saturday then?"

Snape inclined his head before whirling around and sweeping out of the room with a billow of cloak.

Harry headed over to the living area and collapsed onto the sofa. "He had some news?"

"The next part of the potion he's making requires him to leave Hogwarts on Saturday. Three of our suspects have the duelling class but the others are free." Sirius explained, leaning against the mantle and smiling at Harry. "Hopefully this will reveal who Crouch is pretending to be or narrow the field again."

"About time." Harry said with a sigh. "It's taken forever!"

"It's taken far longer than anyone wanted it to." Sirius agreed. He nodded at Bill. "How are things going with the ritual research?"

Bill perched on the arm of the sofa and grimaced. "We're missing Lawrence." He said. "We've managed to gather up as much information as we can but we think Riddle has the only definitive copy of what it involves. There are a couple of first-hand accounts from a resurrection back in Greece; Caro's working through the translations." He motioned at Sirius. "Are we sure we don't want to screw with the potion?"

Sirius shook his head. "Both Bertie and Albus think that's a bad idea and Snape has confirmed that the structure of the potion means that the only possible sabotage would provide Voldemort with a less than human body which would be to our detriment if anything. Animals are more instinctive and we need him to respond in a way we can anticipate."

Bill nodded. "What about this antidote for the preggers lady? I thought that would have been ready by now?"

"Friday." Sirius confirmed. "It was Snape's other bit of news. Apparently the last ingredient took a few more weeks than he anticipated to be at the right point but it's ready now. The potion should be completely ready Friday evening. We think we'll be able to wake her then and hopefully find out what she knows that Voldemort's so keen to keep her quiet about. Bertie's planning to be there since the most likely thing for her to know is something about the ritual."

"Good. Well, I should head out." Bill said getting up again. "Mum's expecting me for dinner." He grimaced. "I think she's invited another one of her friends' daughters."

"Best not to keep her or the prospective bride waiting then." Sirius agreed with a smirk. "Send her and Arthur our greetings."

Bill laughed at the teasing, gave a nod and a moment later he was gone. Harry breathed out, relaxing as Sirius came to sit beside him, nudging his shoulder.

"Alright there, Pronglet?" Sirius asked gently.

"Long day." Harry said, nestling into the sofa and allowing the warmth of the room and Sirius to lull him into a sleepy contentment.

"Long month." Sirius said, settling into a more comfortable position. "I think on Sunday you and I should take the day off. Head out of Hogwarts and do something fun."

"Yeah?" Harry brightened at the idea. He missed the Sunday father-son days with Sirius that they'd had in the Summer. "That'd be great."

Dobby popped into view in front of them and held out the vibrating mirror with a waggle of his ears. "Wolfy calling his Paddy."

Sirius grinned and took the mirror. "Thank you, Dobby." He tapped the mirror and grinned again. "Moony!"

"Padfoot." Remus smiled warmly at Sirius and his smile widened as Sirius turned the mirror so it caught both him and Harry. "Snitch."

"Moony." Harry smiled back.

"Dora sends her regards." Remus's eyes warmed with affection and Harry was pleased to see it. Ever since the wedding, Remus seemed to have fully embraced his marriage with Tonks and the result was a happy couple. "She's gone to bed early. The cub keeps tiring her out."

"Really? Cissy's bouncing with energy." Sirius commented dryly. "She spent three hours dragging me around London yesterday looking for the perfect crib. Don't worry; she ordered one for you too. It's being shipped so should be with you next week."

"How did she manage to inveigle you into shopping?" Remus asked visibly amused.

"She needs protection from a possible attack from Carrow and Malfoy is out of the country right now on business." Sirius countered seriously. "Besides," he smiled, "I'm just cementing my case for godfather to little Reggie."

Harry rolled his eyes. "You know Draco thinks he's got that sewn up?"

"He's her brother." Sirius argued. "He can't be her godfather. Besides, I am an excellent godfather."

"The best." Harry agreed, smiling.

Remus chuckled. "Narcissa is going to have your balls if you continue calling her child Reggie."

"What about you?" asked Sirius. "Any names in the frame?" He smoothed a hand down in his front. "I'd like to remind you that Sirius is a good name."

Harry burst out laughing.

Remus shook his head. "Dora suggested Theodore John after our fathers since it follows Black tradition to name him after forefathers, but I'd rather name him something unique."

"Do not call him Quaffle!" Sirius instructed with mock sternness.

"I was going to suggest Bludger." Remus countered.

Harry laughed again and the two men joined in. The hilarity died down and Sirius pointed at the mirror with a wagging finger.

"I assume you called to catch up on my meeting with Snape, Moony?" Sirius didn't wait for a reply but launched into it a summary.

Remus regarded them with a frown. "Sounds like you have a busy weekend coming up."

"We were thinking of taking Sunday off." Sirius said brightly.

"Good idea." Remus seemed to look past them for a moment and turned back with a sigh. "Got to go. Dora's just freaked the house elves out asking for Angel Delight whatever that is."

"It's a muggle pudding mix." Harry explained. "You just add milk and whisk and you get this thick mousse kind of thing. My Aunt Petunia used to make it for posh dinners when they had people over."

Remus smiled at him. "Thank you, Harry. Have a good night." His gaze drifted to Sirius. "Good luck with the alliance meeting tomorrow."

The mirror winked out and Sirius placed the mirror carefully down on the coffee table. He slung an arm around Harry. "I think you need an early night."

Harry didn't argue. He was very tired. He gave Sirius a quick hug and said his goodnights. His bedtime routine was quick and he clambered into his bed with a sigh of pleasure at the crisp clean sheets that surrounded him.

Hedwig gave an approving hoot from her perch and Harry closed his eyes…

*The cemetery was cold. The gravestone in front of him was all too familiar. He reached out and touched the words reverently.*

'*Where there is love there is life.'*

*It wasn't the first time he'd dreamed of the cemetery and his parents' graves since Paris. Every night since he'd returned to England it seemed he dreamed of it again and woke with a sense of foreboding. So much so that he was almost afraid to sleep…*

"*You are drawn to this place." A voice intruded into the hushed silence and broke Harry's remembrance of his parents.*

*He turned to face the visitor, a young man who looked remarkably similar to Harry but with an old-fashioned style of robe he had seen once before. "They're my parents."*

"*Your blood." His ancestor said crisply. "Your flesh and bone." He approached another step and paused beside Harry. "Our parents make us more than any other. You should remember that."*

*Harry shivered. "I'm not sure I'll remember this any more than I remember the other conversations I've had here." He could only remember fleeting glimpses of his conversation with Ignotus; only a faint memory of speaking with Death.*

*The young man smiled at him. "You'll remember this one because I am the reason you can speak with the Dead."*

*Cadmus. Harry stared at him for a long moment. "You're Ignotus's brother."*

"*Yes." Cadmus agreed. "Your many times great-uncle." He lifted a hand and revealed an image of the gleaming Resurrection stone. "I harnessed my gift and it is now yours. You could speak to whomever you wish."*

"*I spoke with my parents already." Harry admitted. It was singularly his most brilliant and painful memory. He knew he couldn't use the stone again. It was too tempting. "Why are you here?"*

"*Ignotus thought you might respond better to someone else other than him this time."*

"*It's not that…I don't…I dislike what he did." Harry said grudgingly. "I was upset before but I understand it."*

"*Yes, you more than anyone would." Cadmus agreed. "You won't make the same choice."*

"*No," agreed Harry, "I won't make the same choice."*

"*Good," Cadmus said, "you shouldn't make the same mistakes we made. We spent so much time making the Hallows, we forgot their blessing." His smile turned wistful. "I spent so much time wishing to be with the dead, I forgot to want to live."*

*Harry could remember when he had felt the same; when he'd felt the pain of losing Sirius and his parents. He turned back to the gravestone, aching with empathy.*

"*Ignotus lost Antioch and I when we fell on the battlefield. He paid for our mistakes. You are paying for them now." Cadmus said. "But for all you have lost, you have love, Harry, and where there is love…"*

"…*there is life." Harry completed the quote and turned back to Cadmus only to find him gone.*

Harry startled awake, his heart pounding. The conversation was clear in his mind, so clear…and yet still so enigmatic. He scrubbed a hand over his face, frustrated, and turned over again in his bed, punching his pillow. He'd have to discuss the dream with Sirius and Remus, Harry mused wearily. Maybe they'd be able to decipher the message Cadmus had given him.

He snorted.

Or maybe it was just a dream.

o-O-o

"…and I say that all he needs is a good sharp smack in the mouth with a trout!" Griselda Marchbanks declared with a smirk.

"Really, Griselda!" Augusta commented.

"I don't think I've ever seen that particular move employed in a Wizengamot debate before." Daniel Greengrass murmured as Carl Branstone laughed beside him.

Albert Goldstein lifted his cup. "Griselda always has a unique outlook on political debate."

Tiberius Ogden gave a huff. "You have that right!"

Sirius barely allowed his own smirk to grace his lips for a moment before he cleared his throat and brought the meeting of the Ancient and Noble Houses in the Potter alliance to order.

"We're here to prepare for the upcoming Wizengamot session and share news." Sirius stated. He nodded toward Daniel.

"Politically we're in a good place," Daniel stated firmly, "the legislature remains under our control. There is a small minority on the old Pureblood side though Malfoy has conceded public leadership of the group to Benjamin Nott. Nott is a true political animal; intelligent, capable and focused. He's not prone to emotional outbursts or rushing in; he makes good arguments." He set down his cup. "We could have done worse."

"Isn't such a capable leader bad for us?" asked a subdued Richard Bones idly.

"Actually, the opposite." Sirius answered. "Nott will keep them under control and we'll have a forthright debate. It's good for the law to have a balanced view and it will mean that our laws will gain more credibility having taken into consideration any valid points they raise."

"The next set of laws that are under review will be the muggle laws we want to bring in. Arthur is going to make a proposal to begin reviewing the Statute of Secrecy legislation in the next session based on the findings around muggle technology his Department have made recently. We expect some opposition but that the proposal will pass."

"The laws that Arthur will want to make will be problematic." Tiberius said gruffly. "But we won't have to deal with getting them through for another few months."

"Arthur intends targeting the August session." Sirius confirmed. "It provides enough time for us to ensure that the arguments on our side will be well constructed and to sound out the counter-arguments they are likely to make."

"The other proposal the Wizengamot is likely to have before it is one Avery is making." Daniel grimaced. "All we've been able to find out about it so far is that it is a proposed amendment to the revised Magical Race and Creature laws and its primary thrust is a move to keep any kind of organised creature governance off British soil."

"So a move to ensure Remus can't ever bring the pack here." Sirius summarised with a sigh.

Daniel nodded. "I fear so."

"I can't participate in the debate." Sirius said. "I have too much of a vested interest."

"Exactly." Carl agreed. "I expect they'd object if you did try."

"They may insist anyone in the Potter alliance be prevented from debating on the same grounds." Augusta noted dryly. "We all fall under the House of Potter which is supporting the Lupin pack."

"Agreed," Daniel said, "which is why I will make a motion to have Dirk make the rebuttal for Avery's motion."

Griselda slapped a hand onto the table. "Splendid! I haven't seen that protocol employed for years!"

"Protocol?" asked Richard delicately saving Sirius the trouble.

"The lawmaker defends his own law." Elphias explained simply. "After all, if such an amendment was necessary why wasn't it included in the first place?"

"It's a good move and let's us defeat the motion without calling undue attention." Sirius said. "Anything else on the political front?"

"Remus has sent over some information about international law and progresses they've made where we've fallen behind." Augusta said. "A group of us are looking it over to see where we might want to propose change in the future."

"Good." Sirius nodded, remembering how Remus had reminded him they need to build bonds abroad as well as at home just the day before. Remus himself was making a lot of headway in that regards because of his position in the European werewolf leadership.

"So, leaving aside politics, shall we move onto other topics?" Daniel looked around and a flurry of nods and gestures confirmed agreement.

"The next topic is Riddle and crew then." Sirius said. He updated them on what little news he had. "It's our hope things with Crouch will be brought to a head this weekend and at least we'll be able to lockdown Hogwarts until the third task."

"I have to admit that I'll be relieved if all that happens is we get Crouch out of Hogwarts." Richard said grimly. "Just the knowledge that there's a Death Eater among the students…I've thought about pulling Susan out a dozen times."

"I've given the same consideration about Tony." Albert admitted.

Daniel nodded. "It's a difficult task simply leaving our children in place suspecting there is a snake in the grass that could strike at them at any moment."

"The kids have been great." Sirius said. "They're protecting each other. No-one travels the corridors alone; no-one is alone in their dormitories. They've managed to ensure that Crouch's ability to attack anyone is much reduced."

"It doesn't stop us worrying." Augusta said crisply. "While we all agreed that the children were to remain at Hogwarts, it's maddening knowing we are leaving them in the company of an unseen enemy."

Sirius nodded understandingly. "Believe me, I have the same worries, the same anxieties."

"We know." Daniel said. "And we know of all our children he's most likely to strike at Harry."

"Which he's potentially doing by interfering in the third task." Sirius said, turning their attention to the reason why Crouch was at Hogwarts in the first place.

"Do we know how we think he's going to sabotage it this time?" asked Albert.

Sirius shook his head. "Albus has said that the task is dangerous enough on its own to be life-threatening – just like the second." He paused. "Of course we don't think the aim of this task is for Harry to actually die. To be challenged, yes; mortally, no."

"Because the bastard wants to get Harry at the end of it." Griselda growled.

"Yes." Sirius sighed. "If anything I suspect the task to be designed to Harry's advantage to enable him to succeed."

"The assumption then is that Crouch is in place to ensure that Harry is abducted as soon as the tournament is feasibly over." Daniel surmised with a gesture of his hands. "That's why he needs an agent close; not to sabotage the task but to ensure he gets what he wants from it."

Sirius nodded slowly. "Unfortunately the War Council is of the same opinion. However, even if Crouch gets caught or booted from Hogwarts there's no guarantee that Riddle won't use some other means to get Harry for the final confrontation." More than likely he'd just use Snape – his one remaining agent at Hogwarts.

"Ultimately it may not matter to him if it is your lad who ends up at the end of his wand." Tiberius pointed out. "All the Champions could be considered to have gone through the same challenges as your boy."

"Yes, the thought has occurred to Albus too." Sirius said. "The most likely way for Voldemort to take Harry is with a portkey on the night of the third task. Bagman announced the aim of the task to the Champions just over a week ago now and it's well publicised that they have to traverse a maze with hidden dangers to find a cup." He shifted. "Albus has confided the original cup was to be in the centre of the maze and when the Champion reached it, it would portkey them to the winner's stand at the entrance of the maze. The task has been changed so that each individual has to find their own cup but they still get portkeyed out of the maze ostensibly to the winner's podium."

"I take it the cups are under lock and key." Daniel said soberly.

"Unfortunately all four cups will be on display the night before the task in the entrance hall of Hogwarts thanks to the conditions Voldemort set in the parameters." Sirius said. "They'll be guarded but the risk remains that someone will be able to get to them."

"Daphne says the training plan and sessions are going well." Daniel said breaking the silence that had followed Sirius's proclamation.

"As well as they can." Sirius agreed, lightening his tone. "The alliance is doing their best to help him and we're very grateful."

"Pish-posh." Griselda said strongly. "We only wish we could do more."

"Has anything more been discussed about his affinity with the family magic? Or an alternative to defeating Riddle?" asked Albert.

"There are a couple of possibilities." Sirius prevaricated. "I can't say more than that." His eyes caught Richard's and the Head of the House of Bones winked at him.

There wasn't very much more to cover and Sirius made his way to the Ministry with a sense of satisfaction. The alliance was being wonderfully supportive. Politically they were doing the most of the work leaving him to spend time with Harry.

His spirits rose again as thought of the broom race he had in mind for Sunday. It would be good for them both to get out and do something other than brood over events. Harry looked tired and worn. Sirius had a suspicion he wasn't sleeping well and his son's confidence that morning at breakfast about a dream involving a Peverell suggested it was fact.

The dream was the reason why he was making his way through the Ministry to the Department of Mysteries. He tapped lightly on Bertie's office door and went in at the faint call to enter.

Bertie greeted him with delight and Sirius soon found himself seated with a steaming cup of tea. "So what brings you here today, Sirius? I'm afraid if it's progress on the ritual research…"

"No," Sirius shook his head, "Bill gave me a brief update on that yesterday." He sipped his tea and set it aside. "Harry had a dream last night." He briefly sketched out the detail which Harry had provided that morning. "Do you think it's possible it was the spirit of Cadmus Peverell and that Harry has been having conversations with him and Ignotus in his dreams?"

"I think all things are possible." Bertie said, looking at Sirius over the rim of his own cup. He took a fortifying sip. "Harry united the Hallows the night he spoke to his parents at the cemetery. He wore the cloak, called the wand and unlocked the stone. It's remarkable that all that happened that night was a comforting talk with his parents and your reunion."

Sirius nodded slowly. "You don't have to explain to me what could have potentially happened, Bertie."

"Since Madame Verte was kind enough to share the story of the Hallows with you and Harry, it's been clear that there are forces at work we cannot comprehend. If we take the story at face value, Harry is Death's Champion. He is barred from using the Hallows as Ignotus did to end a life but…nothing has been said to discourage using the Hallows otherwise." Bertie continued thoughtfully.

A faint stirring of hope began to unfurl in Sirius's heart.

Bertie gazed into his tea as though it held the answers. "Three things strike me. Firstly, Harry's ancestors are reaching out through Cadmus's gift to talk to Harry and share knowledge. You say Harry doesn't remember the first dream?"

"He dreamed it back in Paris and barely remembered it on waking. He dismissed what he did remember and put it down to an overactive imagination after Vivien's tale. He vaguely remembers yelling at Ignotus, clearly remembers it took place in the cemetery, said he thought Death turned up somewhere in all of it, but he says the rest of it is just a jumble of impressions; frustration more than anything." Sirius said.

"In this dream, we have Ignotus send Cadmus as an envoy. The brother who could speak to the dead sent instead to speak to the living." Bertie said. "This is an attempt to ensure that Harry remembers which would make the detail important." He put his cup down and clasped his hands. "The dreams have both taken place in the cemetery by his parents' graves. Cadmus draws attention to that in Harry's dream and notes blood, flesh and bone come from the parent." He tapped his fingers together. "It's interesting that these are the three ingredients required for the resurrection."

"Do you think he's trying to tell Harry something about the ritual?" Sirius asked soberly.

"Perhaps." Bertie allowed. "The bone is from the father but we've never focused on the importance of Riddle's own genealogy within the ritual." He pursed his lips and picked up a quill to scribble a quick note to himself. "We shall look into this more, I promise you."

Sirius nodded. "What about the rest of the dream?"

"It's interesting that it focused on Cadmus warning Harry not to make the same mistakes they made." Bertie frowned and reached for his tea.

Sirius waited a tad impatiently but he knew from the thoughtful frown that Bertie was working things through in his brilliant brain.

"Let us start with the first mistake; Lumiere's account suggests that the three brothers split up on the battlefield. They were separated from the start, each with their own artefact but it was not enough in the eyes of magic to make the Hallows work as one, to imbue them with the blessings Merlin and the family magic had given them."

"Ignotus was left alone without his brothers." Sirius said out loud, trying to understand the point Bertie was making.

"They didn't stand together." Bertie stated again. "That was the first mistake. Thus, Harry should not fight alone but with those that provide him strength." He set his cup down. "If we allow him to be taken on the night of the tournament then it follows that for a period of time he will face Riddle alone."

Sirius nodded slowly. "If we knew where Voldie is doing the ritual we could be there and set up an ambush. Harry wouldn't be alone." Or if they found Voldemort before the third task – despite that possibility looking more and more remote as time went on.

"It is something we should aim for but realistically, Sirius?" Bertie said gently.

"I know." Sirius sighed heavily.

Bertie tapped his fingers together. "Of course, Cadmus could have been speaking about a metaphorical loss rather than a physical one. It is entirely possible that the brothers metaphorically 'lost' each other either through an argument or some other kind of schism."

"So Harry just has to keep in mind that he isn't alone?" Sirius hummed, his mood brightening.

"Perhaps. There is strength in numbers, in allies." Bertie said.

Sirius nodded again. Hadn't Harry won the Heirs to fealty with just such a statement? Hadn't Lily and James counselled that Harry was weaker when he pushed others away? He gestured signalling a change of topic. "Cadmus mentioned mistakes and for Harry not to make the same."

"Each of the brothers relied on their own artefact alone." Bertie said. "The magic wanted them to work in concert. If Harry uses the artefacts then, he cannot pick and choose; he must use all three." He continued solemnly. "Nor can he make the mistakes the brothers made."

"Antioch relied too much on the fight in front of him and forgot that sometimes there is treachery from behind." Sirius stated. "Cadmus dwelt too much in death and not enough in life. I think the conversation with Lily and James helped Harry in that regard." It had helped Sirius.

Bertie nodded compassionately. "And Harry has confirmed he will not use the Hallows to take Voldemort's life from him as though he was Death himself as Ignotus did with the Seven. That mistake will not be repeated."

"So, if Harry takes the artefacts into the battle with Voldemort he should be able to use them." Sirius nodded decisively. "That's good to know."

"'All for one and one for all.'" Bertie said quietly.

Sirius raised his eyebrows in silent question.

"A quote from some literature I once read." Bertie explained. "It was a fascinating tale of treachery and adventure, romance and friendship, particularly brotherhood."

"The Marauders had that once." Sirius replied. "'All for one and one for all' – that could have been us at school."

"Do you think Pettigrew will help you?" Bertie said.

"No," Sirius shook his head, "I rather think he's the 'treachery' in all this." His grey eyes dimmed with memories. "He certainly was the last time." He sighed. "If I think back to 'eighty-one, I know we went ahead and made the same mistakes the Peverells did. James didn't see Wormtail stabbing him in the back; I focused too much on vengeance for the dead and not enough on taking care of the living; and Remus stepped back from Harry because he didn't have us to strengthen him." He lifted his tea-cup. "And yet, in many ways, we were already lost; we'd already allowed distrust and distance to start separating us."

"You won't make the same mistakes this time." Bertie commented.

"Not the same mistakes," Sirius agreed dryly, "but I'm sure we'll make all new ones!"

The thought kept echoing in his head as he headed out to his last meeting of the day. It had been requested that morning and it wasn't one he was looking forward to attending. He mentally prepared himself as he stepped into the Ministry floo and out into the reception room at Black Manor.

Penny greeted him, taking his cloak swiftly. "Lord Nott and the Malfoys are waiting for you in your study. They have a tea-tray; would you like anything?"

"I'm swimming in tea." Sirius said with a quick negative shake of his head. He left Penny in the library and entered his study, wrapping the mantle of Lord Black around himself like a shield.

Two of his three visitors rose when he entered; Lucius had already been on his feet. Sirius ignored the men and greeted his cousin first.

"Cissy. You look blooming." Sirius bussed her cheek and squeezed her hand supportively. She did look stunning; pregnancy suited her, adding colour to her complexion and providing a healthy weight to her body.

"Thank you, Cousin." Narcissa replied formally. She allowed him to usher her back into her chair while he greeted Nott and Lucius with handshakes.

Sirius remained standing when Lucius demurred over taking a seat. He was Slytherin enough to understand the subconscious power exercise of standing over someone who was seated and he refused to allow Lucius to use the tactic on him.

"Good to see you back in the country, Lucius." Sirius said evenly. "When did you get back?"

"We travelled this morning." Lucius inclined his head toward Nott.

Sirius hadn't realised they had gone together. "And the first thing you requested was a meeting with me?"

Nott nodded. "The Dark Lord has been busy abroad. Carrow's pet vampire is in charge of raising an army and to spread the word of his imminent return on the night of the third task."

Sirius's eyes narrowed dangerously. "You heard this abroad?"

"From Elbert Blanc." Nott said giving up his contact bluntly enough that Lucius raised his eyebrows.

Blanc was a prominent politician in the French Court de Magicale. He was the head of an old family and a brilliant tactician. He had been the public face of the French government's refusal to lend Britain aid in the last war. He wasn't a Death Eater but his sympathies were not far removed.

"His estate neighbours mine in Brittany." Nott explained. "Our families have enjoyed a cordial relationship for over a hundred years."

Sirius inclined his head. "His source?"

"A messenger." Nott grimaced. "From the description I would say it was Dennis Travers."

"Makes sense." Sirius commented coolly. "We believe Crouch is at Hogwarts still, Pettigrew is tasked to remain close to Voldemort, and Carrow is persona non grata on the continent after the incident in Bulgaria."

"Travers is a poor diplomat." Lucius drawled casually, flicking lint from his sleeve. "But he is effective at delivering a message."

Sirius frowned. "There's been no sight of him travelling abroad."

"The vampires have supply lines." Nott explained brusquely. "We believe he was secreted out in this fashion and landed in France almost four weeks ago."

Sirius crossed his arms. "I can't help but note that you're telling me all of this information very freely."

Nott sighed and leaned back the chair he had selected. "You know my motivation, Sirius. I will not restate it."

"I'm certain we all share the need to protect our children." Narcissa asserted, drawing Sirius's attention. "If the Dark Lord returns, none of our children will be safe." She looked at Sirius with determination. "You know more than you have shared with us."

"I do." Sirius agreed. There were many things which he wouldn't share with the Malfoys.

"We know that the Dark Lord plotted to get Potter into the tournament." Lucius said. "We know he is plotting to return."

"The date of the third task is magically significant." Nott continued. "There is a resurrection ritual that calls for the blood of an enemy who has been challenged and in fear of their lives for nine months – a condition which could be said to be met through that same enemy being a champion in the tournament."

Sirius debated for a long moment whether to concede the information. It wasn't surprising that they'd pieced some of it together. "You know the ritual?" He asked instead, knowing his question was as much of an admission as though he'd stated it explicitly.

Nott withdrew a book from his cloak and placed it on a side table. "I once lent this book to Tom Riddle. I don't doubt that he has remembered the contents."

Sirius almost swallowed his tongue. A book! An actual book! They'd been searching for information about the ritual and Nott had just handed it all to them without…without asking for anything in return…

"We have a détente but nothing that would press you to provide this level of aid and support. I assume you want protection?" asked Sirius bluntly.

"For Theo." Nott reiterated.

Sirius held Nott's gaze for a long moment but found only sincerity and determination looking back at him. He made his decision abruptly. "Lucius and Narcissa will be covered by family oaths," he said, "I'll need an oath before I tell you anything further."

"I'll make a vow." Nott agreed unhesitatingly.

The wording took a few moments to agree but the vow was swiftly taken.

Sirius directed Lucius to a seat and took one himself as he confirmed their suspicions regarding the ritual and the role of the tournament. "We think Voldemort will try to grab Harry from the tournament and use him in the ritual."

"You have a plan to prevent this?" Lucius asked snidely.

"A couple." Sirius confirmed in a sharp tone that warned Lucius to watch himself.

Narcissa cleared her throat. "You are not confident that either will work."

Sirius tilted his dark head in his cousin's direction. "Both plans rely on us either finding Voldemort or the agent he placed within the castle, or finding out what method he will use to abduct Harry before it happens. For the latter, we can close down many avenues but the portkey ward will be down during the third task and the champions will be ostensibly alone in the maze."

Nott grimaced. "It would be easy enough to plant a portkey in the task's obstacles keyed to your son."

Sirius nodded grimly. "On the former…well, we might find Crouch before the third task but we all think he's insane enough to ensure we wouldn't get anything out of him unless we managed to completely immobilise him and dose him with truth serum before he could do anything."

"I see your dilemma." Nott said, his face creased in thought. "I assume you are contemplating allowing Lord Potter to be taken so you can find Riddle and finish this?"

"It is one option." Sirius said calmly.

"You can't be serious!" Narcissa exclaimed, her eyes widening with horror.

Sirius repressed the urge to make the obvious joke – it wasn't the time for levity. He turned to his cousin instead. "Voldemort has an obsession with Harry. If we don't find Voldemort but stop him from taking Harry that saves Harry from one torment but means Harry continues to live with the threat of Voldemort hanging over him until they do meet. Knowing he will try for Harry on the third task gives us a window of opportunity." He raised a hand when her eyes flashed angrily. "I don't want to use Harry as bait or have him involved at all but Harry believes that this might be the best way to end this and I can't argue with his logic."

"How very Gryffindor." Lucius sneered.

"And Slytherin." Nott countered. "Turning an enemy's plan back on themselves is very Slytherin."

"Harry has some Slytherin traits." Sirius acknowledged. "If this plan goes ahead, we would have a small advantage but an advantage." He grimaced. "Although the news Voldemort is out amassing support is not welcome."

"You do realise that the first thing he will do when resurrected is call all who wear the Mark to him." Lucius said derisively.

"Lucius is correct." Nott said. "Riddle will call us and punish any who do not answer. In this you may be comforted that he will not kill your son immediately if he has him; he will want an audience."

"How many of you will be called?" asked Sirius bluntly.

"Within the country and not imprisoned?" Nott hummed. "Perhaps twenty or thirty of us that are known to each other although he may only summon those in the Inner Circle of which they were around fifteen, about ten of us who are not imprisoned."

Sirius hid his own satisfaction at Nott's openness. "I guess it's likely that *you'll* end up being called either way."

"The question is what do you want us to do when we are called?" Nott rejoined. "If he wants us to injure your son we can argue, those of us with the détente that is, we can argue we cannot harm him, but we will do that at risk of torture and death."

"He'll ask you to make a choice sooner or later regardless of the when." Sirius pointed out. "You know that and accepted the risk when you agreed the détente."

Nott conceded with a gesture.

"I assume you wish for me to spy." Lucius said cuttingly.

"You assume wrongly." Sirius said firmly. "You've done a great deal for the House of Black since the Summer, Lucius, and he won't forgive you for placing yourself back under the House primacy. I'm not interested in sending you in like a lamb to slaughter so you're safe. If the worst comes to the worst and Voldemort survives the encounter and is free, you can go abroad and hide."

Lucius was unable to hide his surprise for a moment but he swiftly covered with another sneer. Narcissa raised her cup in gratitude.

"Myself and the others are not so fortunate." Nott stated dryly. "We shall have to think about our response carefully." He caught Sirius's gaze again. "Theo talks with passion of your son's power and prowess. Are you confident that he will be able to defeat him fully?"

"He can defeat him." Sirius responded forcefully.

"He has affinity with the family magic." Nott noted, his eyes shrewd and calculating. "Does he mean to use it?"

Sirius raised one eyebrow in mocking acknowledgement. "He has an affinity, yes, but that may be because he has the oaths of fealty and alliance from the others. Whether all the magic would come when it's called…"

Nott grimaced ruefully. "I can see why there is doubt. You are not certain the magics of those who are branded with the Dark Mark would accept his call."

Sirius gave a slow nod.

"Something for us to think about." Nott said quietly almost to himself. "Perhaps our oaths to do no harm would suffice…" he shook his head and got to his feet. "Thank you for your candidness, Sirius. We will need to discuss a way forward with our allies. Do you give permission for us to speak to them on this?"

"I'll allow you to reveal the likelihood of the third task's link to the potential resurrection, and to talk in general terms that it is likely that Voldemort had a plan for abducting Harry and what you might want to do, or not, if he does call you to bear witness to attempting to kill my son again." Sirius said sharply as he stood. "Nothing else. You don't mention explicitly that we may use it as an opportunity to take him down."

Nott picked up the book and handed it to Sirius. "You may keep this."

Sirius nodded his thanks and after Nott took his leave from the Malfoys escorted him out to the floo. He returned to the study and the Malfoys who sat in stony silence.

"You should have already confided in us." Narcissa remonstrated with him coldly. "We are useless to you if we are without inside knowledge and you know we are bound to keep your secrets."

Sirius glared back at her. "And if I trusted you wholly you'd consider me a fool."

Narcissa conceded the point with an angry toss of her head.

Sirius sighed and gestured with the book. "There is not much else to tell, Cousin. You know about the prophecy."

"Then you seek to resolve it on the night of the third task." Lucius said stiffly.

"Now you sound like Albus." Sirius commented aiming for a cheery tone.

Lucius flushed a purple colour. "There is no need to insult me."

Sirius held up a hand in silent apology but inwardly awarded himself a point.

Lucius gave a huff and finally sat, perching himself on the sofa next to his wife. Hi hand caressed the top of his cane giving away his nervousness. "It is a sound stratagem to ambush the Dark Lord when you have knowledge he is to strike."

Sirius sat and leaned back in his own chair giving the impression he was more relaxed than he felt. "I'd be happier if we didn't have to risk Harry in the effort."

Lucius acknowledged Sirius's words with a small nod. "A pity but he is up to the challenge."

There was a hint of a question in the remark and Sirius ignored it.

"What's your take on his gathering support abroad?" Sirius asked instead.

"The Dark Lord will want to return in a position of strength." Lucius said. "He cannot be unaware of the political environment you have created here. He knows he cannot retake the ground he has lost with the few followers he has that remain loyal to him."

Sirius nodded. It made an unfortunate kind of sense.

"You cannot trust though that those who have sworn détentes will keep them in the face of his presence." Lucius said quietly.

It was a fair warning and Sirius nodded. "I'd hope they'd think twice about lifting a wand to help him but I'm not counting on it."

Lucius nodded in reply and fingered his cane again. "Speaking of trust, Severus Snape has informed Avery that he is now working on a key potion to restore the Dark Lord. I believe it was this rumour which alerted Benjamin to the exact nature of the ritual the Dark Lord intends to use."

"I'm aware of what Snape's up to." Sirius said dismissively.

"Very well." Lucius glanced at Narcissa who raised an elegant eyebrow. He sighed and turned back. "The other thing of note you may wish to consider is that a large consignment of magical snakes has been procured and is on its way to Hogwarts. Nott and I witnessed the magical transportation this morning at the Ministry."

It had to be for the third task, Sirius realised. Magical snakes would provide a good obstacle in the maze – and it validated the theory that Voldemort would have stacked the third task in favour of Harry assuming he knew about Harry's Parseltongue abilities.

"There were a number of poisonous breeds included." Lucius continued with a sneer.

"Perhaps it would not be remiss for Harry to learn some healing spells as part of his training." Narcissa added.

"That's a good idea." Sirius acknowledged and made a mental note to talk to Harry about including it in the training plan.

Lucius changed the topic to the upcoming Wizengamot session and Sirius let him, interested to see how much Lucius would give away about Avery's petition. It was another hour before the Malfoys took their leave.

Sirius flooed back to Hogwarts and took sanctuary in the small study in his quarters. He sent a letter with Hooter to Bill asking him to call around that evening. He planned to give him Nott's book to aid the investigation into the ritual. Hopefully it would provide some details they didn't have; give them some kind of advantage.

His mirror vibrated and Sirius picked it up quickly, grinning as he answered and Moony's face swam into view. It took Sirius quite a while to catch Remus up with the events of the day. His oldest friend looked grave when Sirius had finished.

"You've had quite the day." Remus commented, stroking his chin. "It hasn't even been twenty-four hours since we last spoke."

Sirius shrugged. "Things are beginning to move."

"Which is why I was calling you." Remus said. "Dora and I have been talking and we think we should come home…"

"Moony…"

"Hear me out, Padfoot." Remus said firmly. His warm brown eyes met Sirius's through the mirror. "Politically, we're out of the woods in terms of mine and Dora's relationship. Yes, there's still some fallout but not much. With your permission we'll move into the Black estate and Dora will be behind major wards and protected; out of sight then for the most part. But we'll be able to spend time with you and Harry, and be there for the third task. Dora knows she can't be part of the fight but I will not let you and Harry face that alone."

Sirius battled with his head and heart for a long moment. His heart wanted his friend beside him but also wanted to protect him; his head believed their plans would only benefit from having Remus closer but was also concerned that the political fallout of having Remus back in England wasn't going to be as minimal as Remus thought. He sighed heavily. "You have permission to move you and Dora to the Black estate."

Remus began to smile triumphantly.

"But, Moony, you keep a low profile and you both stay out of the fighting." Sirius stated sternly.

"We'll make the arrangements and aim to come back early next week." Remus said with only a touch of smugness.

Sirius harrumphed but his expression warmed. "You've been missed, Moony. It'll be good to have you home."

Remus smiled brightly at him. "It'll be good to be home, Padfoot. We'll talk more tomorrow."

The mirror went blank and Sirius gave a small chuckle. He couldn't deny he was relieved Remus would be with him again. It had felt so wrong the werewolf being so far away…he frowned as a thought drifted through his head.

Hadn't Cadmus warned of schisms and distance? Hadn't James and Lily?

Sirius shook himself as though he were in his Grim form suddenly pleased that he'd agreed to the homecoming. It was time for them to come together, time for the allies to make sure there was no distance separating them. His lips firmed. They wouldn't make the same mistakes as the Peverell brothers; Harry's survival depended upon it.

o-O-o

Harry scoffed down the last of his toast and hummed at the headline in the Prophet. It was clear that the imminent Wizengamot debate about werewolves in Britain had already come to the attention of the newspaper and there was a tentative article presenting both sides of the debate. He wondered if Moony returning with Dora would be reported as a good thing or a bad thing…

Sirius bounded up to the table, taking his place with a swish of his wand to lay the napkin on his lap and start the pot pouring his early morning coffee.

Harry stared at him a little bemused. "You're in a good mood."

"Moony was on the mirror," Sirius explained, "He's confirmed he's coming back on Sunday to oversee the preparations and then Dora and the bump will follow after him. Patrick's staying behind on the Farm but Clara's coming with them to give Remus some help with the steward work."

Harry smiled back at his beaming father. "That's great! I can't wait until they're back."

"Me either." Sirius said cheerfully. "It'll be good to have them home." He took an appreciative sip of his coffee, humming in satisfaction. "I was thinking we might give the Prophet an exclusive interview with the happy couple at the Black estate ahead of the Wizengamot session."

Harry nodded, pleased at the tactic. It wouldn't end the debate but it would give them some positive press before the session.

The door chimed.

Harry looked at his watch and grimaced. "I have to get to class."

"Be good." Sirius said brightly. "And if you can't be good…"

"Don't get caught." Harry chorused with him.

They grinned at each other briefly.

Harry grabbed his bag and hurried over to the door. Bill was waiting patiently on the other side. He nodded a greeting and a goodbye to Sirius as Harry stepped through the doorway and they were on their way.

"So History of Magic first right?" Bill asked.

"That's right." Harry said, looking forward to the class. Professor Memoire made the history class much more interactive and fun. There was no opportunity to sleep as there had been with Binns.

"Charms for the rest of the class after that so Caro and I will be taking you for a duelling session." Bill recited.

"And then Potions all afternoon." Harry made a face to show his disgust and Bill laughed. Harry adjusted his bag. His relationship with Snape had improved leaps and bounds but Harry still didn't enjoy being taught by the spy. "What about you?"

Bill copied Harry's disgusted face and sighed. "More research."

"Don't you have to do a lot of research as part of your job?" questioned Harry with sincere interest. Curse-breaking sounded like a great job.

"I do," Bill admitted, "but normally I'm not the one going through the dusty books. I usually get the summary from the research team and have to then work out practically what I do with it."

"You miss it." Harry commented feeling a touch guilty.

Bill shrugged. "I've enjoyed my service, Harry, never doubt that; it's been important and it's opened my eyes to a lot of things." He smiled suddenly. "I can't deny though that I'll be glad to get back to my day job for a while," his smile took on a hint of the twins' mischief, "you know going through dusty old tombs with dead bodies and…"

"Yeah, yeah." Harry said, waving him off as he remembered why he'd ruled Bill's job out as a possible career option.

Bill deposited him at the door of History of Magic where the rest of the fourth year Gryffindors were already waiting.

Harry kissed Hermione lightly, sliding his hand into hers and grinning at her a touch.

Hermione's eyebrows rose a touch. "You seem happy."

"Why shouldn't he be?" Ron remarked. "He's staying in the dorm tonight!"

Harry nodded. "And Remus is coming home on Sunday."

"Really?" asked Hermione, lighting up. "Oh, it'll be good to see him and Dora! Andy will be thrilled."

Harry was about to reply when the classroom door opened and the Professor ushered them inside. He shrugged away his reply; he'd tell Hermione about Crouch and the press stuff later.

o-O-o

Barty whistled low under his breath as he whirled his wand in the right sequence. Gilbert Pinner, the plain Seventh Year Ravenclaw he was pretending to be, was a perfect foil for him.

Gilbert was a pureblood orphan of a very Minor house very distantly related to the Crouches. The young boy lived with his Grandfather, an irascible old man who had died a very quick death under Barty's wand. Gilbert was nicely potioned up in the basement and under the guard of an elf he had purchased back during the previous Summer when he'd had freedom to roam.

At Hogwarts Gilbert was an introverted student, shying away from the other students. He was treated courteously by the others in his year but there were no close friendships. He would leave Hogwarts with an unremarkable education. Little Gilbert should be grateful to him, Barty considered. Certainly once it was revealed that Barty had chosen him to impersonate, the Ravenclaw would find himself the sudden centre of attention. Well, perhaps posthumously, but still – fame and infamy were on the cards for Gilbert.

Of course, Barty couldn't wait to be free of the disguise and he was closer than ever to that goal; his mission at Hogwarts was almost over.

His main mission was to set-up the third task to ensure it delivered Harry into the hands of his Father. The Dark Lord was insistent that it had to be Potter and after all the work that Barty had put into getting Potter into the tournament, he was agreed. The parameters of the task had been changed to be more dangerous and while Moody's security was tight, Barty had finally been able to sabotage the maze two nights before.

There was only the switching of Potter's cup for the duplicate one with a portkey. Barty had thought he'd need to stay in Hogwarts to do the spell but while the cups were tightly locked up, the podiums they would be displayed upon were simply stored in an old classroom. Barty had spelled all four with a timed switching spell just to be on the safe side. His first mission then was all but complete.

The second mission the Dark Lord had assigned was easy enough; somewhere to hide the vanishing cabinet so that a group of the Death Eaters they were recruiting would be able to sneak into Hogwarts under the wards. Barty had left the cabinet in Trelawney's teaching room under a timed transfiguration. The small frivolous unicorn ornament would change at the start of the third task back to its original form. Barty couldn't decide whether he wanted to be at his Father's side in the graveyard or taking down Hogwarts. Whatever his Father wanted, Barty reminded himself. He wasn't too eager to earn another punishment.

Carrow's punishment for not using the ward buster had been brutal; his skin had been half-flayed from his body before Pettigrew had been ordered to heal him. Pettigrew was a mediocre wizard so Carrow had been left horrifically scarred. Barty valued his own looks and was keen to avoid that particular punishment. Carrow had at least been useful in helping them have a conduit to Europe to recruit. With so many of their supposedly loyal brethren in England rolling over for Black and the reshaped Wizengamot, the Death Eaters needed new members.

At least the charm that Pettigrew had given him to hide was working. Pettigrew had informed the Dark Lord at the beginning of the school year of a map, an artefact that he had created along with his friends which showed every individual within the wards of the castle. In his Seventh Year, Pettigrew had found a spell in the Restricted Section to hide himself from the map so his friends wouldn't tease him if they spotted he was with a girl. Apparently Pettigrew had used the spell liberally at Hogwarts when he'd play-acted as the Weasleys' rat. It had only been in his horror of being chased across the grounds by Black that he had forgotten to recast it. Barty had been wary but so far the charm had worked like a dream. He cast it every morning and night and so far he had gone unnoticed.

But not unsuspected.

He was aware that the staff were cautious. Moreover, no matter how quiet the students kept the rumour, the whispers that a student might be being impersonated had found its way to most of the student populace. He was certain that he was being watched.

'Constant Vigilance' as Moody would say. Barty repressed the urge to chuckle madly.

Barty looked up as Flitwick approached as though to examine his work and carried on when the diminutive Professor went straight by him to the more charismatic Gerhardt Fulstrum. He was miffed at the Professor's dismissal of his perfect work but he assumed Pinner was used to it.

The other mission was one which Barty had set himself; he wanted to ensure that there was no threat to the Dark Lord from either Winky or the Summers woman. It still smarted that Dumbledore, Black and Potter had located the pair.

Barty grimaced. His family magic still would not come to him despite performing the inheritance ritual. He shook away the thought and focused on the charm he was doing.

He'd located Winky pretty quickly. As her Master it had been easy enough to follow their bond. The little elf was kept in a small room off the infirmary. She was attended daily by another elf but other than that was alone. Her room was barely warded. It would be easy enough to sneak in and end her life. Barty felt no remorse for killing the small elf who had cared for him as a child, remembering only her part in his imprisonment by his father; that Winky had had no choice in following his father's orders didn't occur to Barty. He would be safe with her death; the new elf he had acquired would mask him from the Black elves and Winky's fate was sealed.

That left only the Summers woman.

It had been clear after careful investigation that the Summers woman was not at Hogwarts despite the understanding that she was. Barty knew she must have been transferred to a Ministry safe house somewhere and it was unlikely that he'd find her. He'd decided to turn his attention instead to destroying the potion that would wake her.

Severus had sent word to Father that the potion for the Summers woman would be done by the beginning of the following week. Oh, the Potions Master had given the Dark Lord platitudes about ensuring the woman would be mute for the rest of her life when she was given it but Barty wasn't taking any chances. He had managed to locate Severus's quarters and the lab within. He had identified the strong wards that Severus had placed. He knew that destroying the potion would need to be his final foray as he would be discovered and, with the vanishing cabinet out of reach, he would have to fight his way out.

What he needed was a distraction and he'd come up with the perfect one.

Barty almost wished he could grin but it would break his cover. He only needed a few more hours, he reminded himself. Only a few more hours and he would be back by his Father's side…
