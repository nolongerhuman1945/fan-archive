The winter was becoming one of Izuku’s favorite months. Back in Musutafu, infrastructure needed to be kept free of obstruction, and the city had several people with suitable Quirks ready to clear away any snowfall at a moment’s notice. Izuku’s Quirkless background kept him isolated for most of his childhood as well, so the last time he could remember participating in an activity like snowball fights or sledding was before his diagnosis, well more than a decade ago.

With the weather preventing crop growth, the two farmers found themselves in a much more flexible position. They would still go spelunking into the mines or catch fish, but it’s not like the lakes or caverns would be going anywhere, so the two could afford to work at their own pace. Such as Kyoka finding out that Izuku had not had a proper snow day in over a decade and deciding to put all their plans on hold to rectify such a travesty.

They were not the only ones with such an idea, as when the two entered the forest Kyoka immediately heard distant shouts and childish squeals. Venturing further into the woods, the farmers found Jas and Vincent pelting each other with snowballs while Sam and Penny were busy making more ammunition for the children. Off to the side, safely out of conflict, Abigail and Sebastian worked together on creating a malformed snowman that reminded Izuku more of the earth beasts made by Pixie-Bob than anything remotely humanoid.

Vincent was the first to spot the farmers, “Hi Izuku! Hi Kyoka!” The boy called out before being pelted in the back of the head by Jas while he was distracted. While Vincent returned his focus on the game, Izuku and Kyoka walked up to the other couple to inspect their handiwork. “Hey guys, enjoying the weather?” Abigail asked after adding the 5th rock eye to her creation.

“Yep, but it’s a special occasion today.” A curious tilt from Abigail’s head prompted Kyoka to continue. “Izuku here has never been in a snowball fight.” Abigail let out a mock gasp of surprise, “Seriously, that’s just unacceptable! Even Seb’s been in a snowball fight before!”

“Hey!”/”What’s that supposed to mean?” Both boys called out in unison, gaining the attention of the other four. It was quickly decided that such a thing would not stand. “Alright,” Said Izuku, “Are we forming teams? Or is it just one big…” Izuku was interrupted as the five present young adults hit him with snowballs before fleeing into the forest, each in a different direction. After a brief moment of confusion, Jas and Vincent threw a small snowball each, hitting him in the chest before they ran off together as well. “Free for all.” He spoke out to no one.

An afternoon of skirting around trees and laying snow filled ambushes ensued. Izuku adjusted rather quickly, treating the game like some form of Hero exercise. The two farmers quickly became the focus of the game, as their training under Aizawa meant the two were adept at hiding the noise of their movement, even in snow, and Kyoka’s enhanced hearing made any attempts at sneaking up on her useless. What began as a free for all slowly became a six on two match, and despite the disparity in numbers, Izuku and Kyoka were not only holding their own, but largely winning.

Their victory was short lived however, as Izuku threw a snowball that hit Sam in the forehead, and he fell to the ground. Izuku almost turned his focus away when he realized the blond wasn’t getting up. Fearing the worst, streaks of green lightning flared behind him as Izuku rushed to the fallen boy. Right into a trap.

Sam’s eyes snapped open as he sandwiched Izuku’s head between two handfuls of snow, while Penny came up from behind and dumped an armful down the back of his shirt. Confused, disorientated, and very, very cold, Izuku didn’t notice as Abigail, Sebastian, Vincent, Jas, and even Kyoka emerged from the tree line to assault the verdanette.

As Izuku lied on the ground, utterly defeated, Kyoka sauntered up to the snow caked farmer. “You doin’ alright there, Mop-Top?” she asked, before seeing that the joint assault had left his once green hair entirely covered in snow. “Or maybe it should be Snow-Top now?” Izuku let out a soft, muffled groan before being helped up by the violette. “That was terrible.” He said while shaking his hair free of any remaining frozen particulate. “What, the icy beatdown you just got or the joke?” Kyoka asked. “Yes.”

With all the fight taken out of the young farmer, Izuku and Kyoka decided to head back to the farmhouse and warm up. After all, what snow day was complete without an evening filled with hot drinks and shared company. Izuku was much more familiar with this side of the winter months than Kyoka. Without a reason to go out and enjoy the snow, the Midoriya’s had a small tradition of making hot chocolate and baking cookies on their days off. While the Jiro’s spent time together, Kyoka’s parents possessed culinary talents that could be called decent at best, and instead filled their cold winter nights together with music and takeout.

After a simple dinner together, Izuku started to teach Kyoka some of his mother’s baking recipes to keep the family tradition going, while Kyoka went to put on one of her new albums she bought from Zuzu city. Just as the pair were about to place the portioned-out dough into the oven, the two heard a knock on the door.

Izuku opened the door to find a distressed looking Marnie. “Hello Izuku, Kyoka.” The woman looked into the house and saw the used bowls and baking trays. “Oh, I’m sorry for interrupting your evening.”

“It’s not a problem,” Izuku reassured her. “Did you need anything?”

Marnie nervously fiddled with her hands while speaking, “I just came over to ask if either of you had seen Shane. I haven’t heard from him after his shift at the JojaMart.”

“Neither of us have seen Shane at all.” Kyoka spoke over Izuku’s shoulder, “Doesn’t he usually spend some time at the Saloon in the evening?” Her question only seemed to make Marnie even more nervous. “I stopped by to ask Gus if he had seen him at all, but he hasn’t seen Shane either. Clint said he saw him take the path that leads to our house, but he didn’t come home.”

A small pit started to form in Izuku’s stomach. He hoped that this was simply a case of Shane taking some time to enjoy the fresh snow fall after a shift at work, but something told him otherwise. “Has Shane been acting… off, at all?”

“I suppose he’s been in a bad mood for a few days. Well, more than usual anyway. But today he did seem out of it. I could barely get him to talk at all during breakfast.” By now Marnie had to wipe away small tears that had been forming in the corners of her eyes. “I… I thought it was nothing to worry about, but now that no one knows where he is…”

Izuku and Kyoka didn’t need her to finish to understand what was implied, and the part of them that were still Heroes kicked in. While Kyoka shut off the oven to avoid burning down the house and grabbing their winter gear, Izuku was busy calming Marnie. “Kyoka and I will look for Shane,” The rancher tried to interject but the young Hero kept talking. “We can search the forest quickly, and right now I think it’s best for you and Jas to be there for each other. We’ll find him Marnie, I promise.”

The sudden shift in Izuku’s demeanor left Marnie stunned for a moment, only able to nod in agreement to Izuku’s plan before making her way back to her property. Never before had Aizawa’s lectures on not wasting time when changing seem so important, and the pair had slipped into their winter gear in record time. The two quickly split off after reaching the south end of the farm leading into the forest, Kyoka headed deep into the woods to hopefully pick something up with her Quirk while Izuku pumped as much percentage into Full Cowling as he could and raced off to the far end of the forest. If Shane planned to… do something drastic, the most likely spot would be the cliff face at the southmost end of the forest.

As Izuku burst through the tree line, he was relieved to find what looked like Shane, but the fact he was lying face down in the snow and surrounded by empty beer cans did not paint a pretty picture. “Shane? Can you hear me?” Izuku asked the prone man while the lightning faded from his body.

The question got a response from the drunken man, mostly incoherent grumbling, until he briefly lifted his face to look towards Izuku. “Hey I-izu… kid. Why… why’re you out late?”

Izuku walked up to sit down next to Shane, placing his feet over the ledge. “Me and Kyoka were out looking for you. A lot of people got worried when you didn’t come home.”

“Shit… sorry you two got caught up in… this.” Shane slurred out. “I… I don’t know why I’m \*hic\* even here.”

“You mean the cliffside? I’m pretty sure you got drunk and…”

“No!” Shane cut the verdanette off, “Why I’m even still alive. All… all I do is work, sleep, and drink just to get through the day… Why… should I even \*hic\* bother… I should just roll o… off this cliff…”

Izuku grabbed hold of Shane’s arm, just in case he tried to go through with anything. “Shane, you’re not in a healthy state of mind right now and doing something drastic like that is never a good solution. Come on, let’s get you home and tomorrow we’ll…”

Shane attempted to throw off the boy’s hand with all the force he could muster, which given his state wasn’t that much. “Th-fuck do you k… know? You’re just a kid, you s…still got hope. I’m just some… useless fuckin’ waste of space…”

The sudden outburst left Izuku in a conundrum. Nothing was stopping him from just picking up Shane and bringing him back to Marnie, in fact that was probably what he should do. But just leaving the man like this felt wrong. When Izuku was growing up, he wanted to be a Hero that made people feel better just by being around. Even in a world that didn’t have or need Heroes, Izuku couldn’t just leave a situation alone if he could do something to help, even if it was just slightly.

“Before Kyoka and I moved here, the people I grew up with… well, they weren’t kind. It seemed like everyone hated me, told me I was just some worthless freak… useless…”

“Th…that musta sucked.”

Izuku let out a small laugh at Shane’s eloquence. “Yeah, pretty much. I just tried to tough it out, hope someday I could prove everything they said about me wrong… but then one day, my f-“ Izuku cut himself off. After over 3 months of separation, it had been slowly dawning on him that Katsuki was never really his friend. Even if they were close as toddlers, even if he sometimes stopped others from abusing him, a decade of poor treatment wasn’t just some bump in a relationship. While the two had grown to some form of mutual respect after their fight at Ground Beta, it was far from any sort of friendship. “The person I thought was my best friend told me to ‘take a swan dive off the roof.’ And you know… I thought about it. Only for a moment, and I decided I would never do something like that, but in that moment... going on just didn’t seem that appealing.”

“Shit… I-I’m sorry I snapped at you… I-“ Shane mumbled out, clearly setting up for another self-detrimental spiel.

“Hey, it’s alright. I didn’t tell you all that to make you feel bad. My point is that I thought of the people… or at that time I guess it was just the one person that was there for me, and that was enough to keep me going until things got better. It may not seem like it now, but you have a lot of people that care. I know it will probably take a while, and this probably won’t be the last time you feel like you would be better off dead, but things will get better. And I know everyone in this town is more than happy to help.”

At first Izuku thought the silence following his speech was a positive, and that Shane was simply digesting the information before responding, but the continuing lack of a response quickly set him on edge. Izuku was just about to check and make sure the man didn’t pass out when he finally heard Shane speak. “Hey kid…”

“Yeah?”

“I think you should take me to the hospital now…”

Needing no further prompting, Izuku picked the man up while making sure his head was tilted just in case he vomited. A rustling sound caught his attention before he saw Kyoka emerge from the edge of the forest, relived to see Shane alive and… not really that well. But alive, nonetheless.

The trip to Harvey’s clinic took longer than Izuku would have liked, but ensuring Shane wasn’t thrown around from running at full speed kept Izuku from rushing ahead. Kyoka ran ahead of him to alert Harvey to the situation, and Izuku arrived to find the Doctor had already prepped a bed for the man.

“Thank you for bringing him in. I’ll call Marnie and let her know, you two should go home and get some rest after a stressful evening like this.” Harvey said while he prepared the equipment to pump Shane’s stomach and rehydrate him after. “I know an excellent counselor in Zuzu city. Depression is never easy, especially mixed with substance abuse, but she does good work.” Reassured that Shane would be getting treated physically and mentally, the two farmers listened to the good doctor’s orders and went home to finish their baking and get some rest.

As the pair passed the bus stop, Kyoka broke the silence first. “So, I’m guessing that ‘friend’ who told you to jump was Bakugou, right?”

“Y-you heard that?” Izuku stammered out.

“I thought I heard Shane shouting something, but when I got close you were already talking about… that. Didn’t really seem like a good time to interrupt.”

“Well, thanks for letting me finish. But yeah… that was Katsuki.”

“Well, it’s not like I could pay him back for that, no matter how much I want to.” Kyoka squeezed Izuku’s hand. The idea of her boyfriend considering the thought of committing suicide, even for just a moment, made Kyoka want to keep him as close as possible. At least for the evening. “I’m just glad you didn’t listen to him.”

Now at the threshold of their home, Izuku brought his lover into a tight hug. Whether it was for himself or Kyoka, he wasn’t really sure. “Yeah, me too.”

* * *

As Izuku bid farewell to Gunther and closed the door behind him, he heard Kyoka speak from her position on the sofa, “So what did he want?” The farmer flopped back onto the sofa to continue where he left off on the pair’s busy day filled with ‘fuck all’. “Gunther came by to say from all the stuff we donated the museum is being offered some award for ‘significant contributions to the field.’” Izuku dug into his pants pocket to fish out the small trinket the curator passed as a reward. “He also said he wanted us to keep this old key.”

Kyoka took the key from his hands to look it over. While it had obviously been quite beautiful once, the years had taken their toll. Much of the key’s surface was covered in rust, and even the few bits of exposed metal had been tarnished and discolored, but still bore impressive engraving that would have taken quite some time to finish. The overall shape of the object was intact, and the key would likely still work, but that was only if the two could find the lock to which it matched. “So, we find all these gems and artifacts, enough for the museum to earn an award… and he gives us some old key?”

“That is what I just said, yes.” The time he had spent with Kyoka had given the verdanette a rather dry sense of humor, and while he could never quite match the girl quip for quip, he did have his moments.

“Did he even say what it unlocks?” Kyoka asked while handing the key back. Izuku pocketed it before responding, “No, but I think I have an idea.” A quirked eyebrow was enough for him to continue. “Do you remember that old, rusted hatch near the cemetery that leads to the sewers?”

Kyoka let out an exasperated groan. “Are you really going to drag me out to go explore the sewers, on our day off?”

“No,” Izuku wrapped his arms around Kyoka before dragging her down with himself to lay on the couch. “we’re doing that tomorrow.” He felt one of the girl’s earphone jacks snake its way down his chest, stopping at the spot closest to his heart. The first time it happened, the day after the two made their mutual feelings clear, it had been a subconscious act, but one that soon became a regular occurrence. By now Kyoka actually had problems falling asleep unless she was listening to the steady, calming beat of her boyfriend’s heart. Not that either of the two were complaining about it.

“Fine…”

The next day before the two ventured to the mines, hoping that this trip would be the one that would have them reach the bottom, the farmers took a detour to inspect the locked grate that blocked an old sewer tunnel. Normally Izuku wouldn’t bother with entering the sewers and instead simply check if the key did in fact open the way up to sate his curiosity. However, early in the spring, he came across Vincent and Jas by an old sewer tunnel that let out near the forest, trying to figure out a way inside to explore. As he moved closer, the two must have heard something that spooked them, as they quickly ran from the dark tunnel and hid behind his legs. At the time Izuku had chalked it up to overactive imaginations and the wind echoing off the walls inside. Of course, the two farmers had seen stranger occurrences than sewer dwelling creatures by this point, so they felt a quick check was warranted.

A soft click rang out as Izuku inserted and turned the key, and with a slight heave (at least slight for him) the rusted over hinges squeaked and groaned as the grate was forced open.

The smell was… actually not that bad. It was still a sewer, and the scent could be described as anything but pleasant, but either this was a remarkably clean sewer or the two had a surprisingly high tolerance for foul stenches. As the two descended a ladder, instead of the expected pitch-black tunnels, they found the area lit up by wall mounted lights. Izuku walked forward and turned to his left, facing the nearest light. It wasn’t any form of lantern, but what looked like a small, dim globe of pure light. Not only was something living down in the sewers, but it either had access to or used magic.

As Izuku lost himself in thought trying to deduce just what exactly was going on, Kyoka saw a dark, vaguely humanoid mass peek around a corner. As her eyes adjusted to the light level, she realized it wasn’t just shrouded in shadow, but entirely composed of shadows. The earphone jack user was quick to spring into action, “Get back!” she shouted while shoving Izuku behind her and moving her jacks to be ready to strike. Even though this Shadow Person was smaller than the Shadow Brutes that dwelled in the mines, Kyoka wasn’t about to take her chances. Upon seeing the girl enter a combat ready stance, the Shadow Person let out a timid “Eeep!” before darting around the corner.

Out of all the things the two expected from the monster, from a sudden charge or strange magics, a yelp of fear and fleeing was far from top of the list. Both farmers were at a loss on what to do. Clearly it wasn’t hostile like the Shadow Brutes, but trying to pursue might risk being attacked out of fear. Izuku took a few steps forward before speaking “Uh… hello there. I’m sorry if we scared you.” There was a brief period of silence before a quiet voice was heard from around the corner. “Are… are you going to hurt me?”

Kyoka winced at the question and decided to try and reconcile with the monster. “No, we aren’t. The Shadow People we met in the mines attacked us on sight, so when I saw you, I jumped to conclusions… sorry.”

“It’s alright… and I’m sorry for scaring you…” The monster peeked his head out again, and seeing that the two farmers no longer looked hostile, stepped out from around the corner. Like his kin, the Shadow Person was entirely composed of a black mass that reminded the two of Dark Shadow, the sentient Quirk of their classmate Tokoyami. The one in front of them was smaller and seemed to lack arms. “Hello, my name is Krobus. I’m a merchant of sorts. Mostly I just sell things I find to other monsters like myself, or sometimes the Wizard, Rasmodius. But my shop is open to all.”

Izuku walked up and extended a hand, before realizing his mistake. Just as he was about to apologize, Krobus’ body shifted, and part of his torso extended to meet the farmer’s. After a moment of shock, the boy recovered before speaking. “I’m Izuku, and this is Kyoka. We moved here recently.” A spark of recognition flashed across Krobus’ (lack of) eyes. “Oh, the Wizard mentioned you two before. He said you were really friendly.”

With introductions out of the way, Kyoka moved closer to ask the Shadow Person some questions. “If you don’t mind me asking, why are you living in the sewers?”

“W-well, for the most part my people don’t really like humans… and humans tend to destroy things they don’t understand.” Another wince from the violette. “I wanted to experience more of the world than an underground cave, and the Wizard was kind enough to help me set up a shop down here.”

“So, you moved out of an underground cave and into… an underground sewer system?” Asked a very confused Izuku. Krobus didn’t seem to notice the farmers bewilderment. “Yep! It gets so humid down here when it rains. It’s great!”

*‘Well, if it makes him happy…’* Izuku thought to himself. “We we’re just checking to make sure nothing dangerous was down here, but it was nice to meet you Krobus.” With no more reason to stick around, the two-bid farewell to the shadowy merchant and promised to visit his store sometime in the future.

The two made their way to the cave entrance that held the mines and took the elevator down to the lowest floor available. While the elevator car descended deep into the crust of the earth, Kyoka turned to her boyfriend. “Hey Izu…” the boy turned his head to face her.

“If we find more Shadow People, can we… not… fight them?” The knowledge that the Shadow People were in fact sentient gave the farmers incentive to avoid any unnecessary confrontation with the monsters. “I was about to say we should probably avoid them if we can.” As the elevator slowed to a halt and the doors opened, the two stepped out with new conviction, and got to work.

* * *

Izuku was practically vibrating from excitement during the short walk from the farmhouse to the town. Afterall, it wasn’t Christmas every day. Well, to be more accurate, today was the ‘Feast of the Winter Star’, but with the candy cane decorations, large pine trees adorned with ornaments and presents underneath, and a town wide secret gift exchange, it was Christmas in all but name.

The Midoriya duo had always held a rather small celebration on the 25th, a day full of Christmas themed All Might specials ending in a large dinner and a few small gifts between the mother and son. The boy was always grateful for the time he got to spend with his mother who was usually busy with her job as a nurse. He might not have received as many presents or gone on expensive trips over winter break like his more affluent peers, but he never minded that much. *‘Especially now that I have someone like Kyoka to celebrate with.’* He thought while stealing a glance at the violette.

As both farmers drew near to the town center, the two placed wrapped packages underneath a towering pine tree to be retrieved latter for the gift exchange. Lewis had sent out letters a week ago to all the villagers saying who they would be the ‘secret friend’ of. Kyoka’s gift recipient was Linus, an older man who lived a ‘simplistic’ lifestyle, living in a tent in the mountains out of his own volition. While the farmers were at first concerned that the man was destitute, an assumption made after finding Linus rummaging through trashcans, they respected his wishes and didn’t pry or try to ‘fix’ his lifestyle.

Izuku’s ‘secret friend’ was Clint, and the farmer had a much harder time deciding on a gift compared to Kyoka. The blacksmith pretty much lived his profession, and beyond an attraction to Emily that everyone except the girl in question knew about Izuku didn’t have much of a lead on what he liked to do in his free time. Eventually the verdanette decided to get the man something that might give him a new hobby. Or anything to do besides blacksmithing.

The gift exchange wouldn’t be held until after the actual feast, which most of the town considered the real attraction of the holiday, it was in the name after all. A sizable portion of town events had been defined by large banquets, even holidays like Spirit’s Eve had been complimented by a lavish spread, although it was probably to be expected of an agriculture-based town. However, the offerings on display currently made the past events, bar possibly the Luau, look like cheap potlucks unworthy of being called a feast. From roast turkey and prime rib to mashed potatoes and stuffing, it seemed like every type of food the two farmers had associated with a western style Christmas diner was available, and in such a copious amount that the pair began to suspect a large majority of the town’s tax payments went to funding this one holiday.

A few smaller tables for families circled around the larger ‘community’ tables. Kyoka and Izuku passed by Leah and Elliot, both of whom sat next to Gus while looking completely bored out of their skulls by his in-depth explanation of how he makes his artisanal candy canes, and sat down at a table with Marnie, Jas, and Shane. The rancher offered an invitation to dine with them as thanks for the… ‘incident’ with Shane, and while the two insisted that no thanks was necessary, they took up the offer, nonetheless.

Shane was looking much better since that night in the woods, although he was still having some issues with insomnia. Even though the health issues that came with long term alcohol abuse would take some time to show noticeable improvement, Shane was cautiously optimistic for the future. The fact he now was able to spend the money that used to go towards alcohol on other things (like gifts for Jas and Marnie) definitely helped motivate the man.

After some pleasant small talk and the revelation that Shane not only was a surprisingly good ranch hand but had also somehow bred blue colored chickens, the five went to work devouring the table full of food in front of them, not willing to let the meal go cold. After everyone had consumed their weight in turkey, stuffing, and non-alcoholic sparkling grape juice, Lewis announced the start of the secret gift exchange, and the two farmers split off to deliver their presents.

Kyoka approached the grey-haired hermit, who had stayed near the edge of the event after grabbing a plate of food. “Hey Linus, got something for you.” She said with a grin before handing the man the gift. As Linus tore away the wrapping paper, underneath was a tightly rolled sleeping bag designed for winter weather. His eyes lit up as he unrolled the bag, “Why, this is a great gift! Thank you, Kyoka.” With no care to any onlookers, he quickly zipped the bag around himself, wishing to test how it held up to the chill. *‘Well, I’d say that was a success’* the girl thought to herself as she watched Linus roll his way back to his tent. *‘Maybe I should have gotten a color other than yellow though. He’s starting to remind me of Aizawa.’*

Meanwhile, Izuku approached the town’s blacksmith with his gift. “Here you go Clint, I hope you like it!” Briefly shielding his eyes to avoid being blinded by the boy’s smile, Clint unwrapped the present only to tilt his head in confusion at the farmers choice in gift, some basic kitchenware and a few cookbooks. “Not that I don’t appreciate it, but why cooking stuff?”

“Well, you never really talked about doing anything besides blacksmithing, so I figured cooking might be a good hobby. Plus, you wouldn’t have to go to the Saloon every day for dinner.” The man seemed surprised by the response. “Oh, usually every year someone just gets me a new hammer. Y’know, because I’m a blacksmith.” Clint absentmindedly flipped through the books, simply appreciating the fact someone got him a gift that didn’t involve blacksmithing in some way. “Thank you Izuku, this means a lot.”

As the pair of farmers met up by the central tree, Caroline and Harvey stopped by to deliver their own gifts. Caroline gave her fellow green-haired resident a porcelain tea set, and the doctor gave Kyoka an album from a band that was recommended to him, as well as a set of earplugs and a request to not play the music too loud and risk damaging her hearing.

With the gift swap over, most of the residents went home to have their own celebrations with family, while some of the social butterflies of the town stayed to chat and pick over whatever food was left. The two farmers bid farewell and made their way home. “Hard to believe it’s been a year already.” Kyoka said. “Doesn’t really feel like it.”

“Probably because it’s been four months.” The verdanette corrected.

The violette gave Izuku a smirk. “Yeah, I know that, but eventually we’re going to have to get used to the way they measure time here. Might as well start now.” She finished with a shrug.

As the two entered their home and set their gifts down, Izuku thought about how much his life had changed since that day at the mall. In four short months he already found himself calling this place home. “Well, if I knew we would be celebrating our anniversary of moving into town, I would have gotten you something.”

“That’s okay…” Kyoka turned to face Izuku, before pulling him into a deep kiss. “I’ve got everything I need.”
